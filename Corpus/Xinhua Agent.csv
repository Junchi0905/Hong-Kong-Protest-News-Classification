Hong Kong police arrest 148 suspects in Monday's operations,"HONG KONG, Aug. 6 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong police said on Tuesday that they have arrested 148 people during Monday's operations.
The detainees consist of 95 males and 53 females, four of whom have been charged, said the police at a press briefing.
The suspects were arrested for various offenses including unlawful assembly, assaulting police and possession of offensive weapons.
On Monday, protesters destroyed a total of 117 traffic lights and blocked several main routes in Hong Kong. The police accused the protesters of engaging in ""extremely violent behaviors,"" which will not be tolerated.
The police said seven police personnel were injured during Monday's operations.
At the press briefing on Monday, the Hong Kong police said that they had arrested 420 people during a series of protests and clashes between June 9 and Aug. 5. They were charged with taking part in riot, unlawful assembly, assaulting police and other offensives."
Hong Kong's business activity sees steepest fall since 2008 financial crisis: IHS Markit,"HONG KONG, Sept. 4 (Xinhua) -- Decline of business activities in Hong Kong accelerated in August to near-record levels as protests continue to dampen demand, London-based consulting firm IHS Markit reported Wednesday.
Hong Kong's Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) sank to 40.8 in August, down from 43.8 in July, signaling the steepest deterioration in the health of the private sector since February 2009, according to IHS Markit's PMI survey.
The only other time that the PMI survey has recorded a steeper downturn was during the SARS epidemic in 2003 and the global financial crisis in 2008, said Bernard Aw, principal economist at IHS Markit.
PMI is a composite single-figure indicator of economic performance derived from indicators for new orders, output, employment, suppliers' delivery times and stocks of purchases. Figures greater than 50 indicate overall improvement of the economy.
Almost all aspects surveyed for the PMI indicator were worsening in Hong Kong with widespread pessimism and record-low business confidence, according to the report.
""The latest PMI data reveal a Hong Kong economy flirting with recession in the third quarter as business activity is increasingly aggravated by protest-related paralysis,"" Bernard Aw added."
"China lashes out at U.S. politicians for indulging, supporting anti-China disruptors in HK","BEIJING, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- It is because of the indulgence and support by some U.S. politicians that the anti-China disruptors in Hong Kong are so reckless and unscrupulous, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Wednesday, demanding them stop condoning violent criminal offenses and stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs immediately.
Some U.S. lawmakers submitted a bill to the Congress on Tuesday, calling for a suspension of sales of law enforcement equipment by U.S. companies to Hong Kong because they claimed that the police in Hong Kong have been widely criticized for what they did to the protesters. The law enforcement equipment includes tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets.
In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said: ""I wonder if the U.S. Congressmen want to save these anti-riot equipment to deal with problems at home?""
Speaking at a daily news briefing, Hua said that with regard to what happened in Hong Kong recently, the facts are clear.
More and more mainstream international media have reported the true situation in Hong Kong with on-site coverage. ""For example, I just saw many high-resolution photos released by some Russian media, depicting demonstrators' weapons like umbrellas with knives and barbs hidden inside and gasoline bombs,"" she said.
The reports said that some were carrying out terrorist and criminal activities under the cover of freedom and democracy, and the root cause of Hong Kong's violence and chaos lies with the malicious forces behind the scene. The so-called press freedom in Hong Kong is nearing absurdity, according to the reports.
""I would like to ask those U.S. lawmakers, when the violent extremists in Hong Kong brutally assaulted and injured the police and brought public facilities like the airport and subway to a standstill, where is the rule of law that you claim to advocate? When personal information of more than 1,000 police officers and their families were illegally exposed and they were targeted by crazy cyber bullying and threats, where are the human rights that you claim to champion? When people holding different views were chased, surrounded and beaten by black-clad demonstrators wearing masks, where is the freedom you claim to stand for?"" she said.
Hua pointed out that some U.S. lawmakers are beautifying the violent criminal offenses as fight for human rights and freedom. At the same time, they are defaming Hong Kong police by calling their forbearance and restraint ""overuse of force.""
""There is no worse insult to freedom, democracy and human rights than this. It is open disregard for the mainstream public opinion of ending violence and chaos and restoring order, and it exposes their stark hypocrisy and double standard,"" she said.
""How did the U.S. police handle demonstrations? I believe many have vivid memories of the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement, the 2015 unrest in Baltimore, Maryland, as well as the recent demonstrations in Portland, Oregon. If the scenes in Hong Kong were to appear in the U.S., would the U.S. lawmakers still be so 'kind'? We are curious to see,"" she said.
""It is because of the indulgence and support by some U.S. politicians that the anti-China disruptors in Hong Kong are so reckless and unscrupulous,"" Hua said.
She said that at a recent press conference on the situation in Hong Kong, Spokesperson Yang Guang of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office quoted Man Jiang Hong (a classical Chinese poem) composed by Chairman Mao Zedong in 1963.
""Today I would like to add the following two lines: The ants climbing up a locust tree congratulate themselves for running a great empire, but it won't be easy for them to shake the tree,"" Hua said.
""I will reiterate that Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs. No foreign government, organization or individual has any right to interfere. Those playing with fire on this issue will end up getting burned themselves,"" she said.
""We advise certain people in the U.S. to stop pretending to be asleep, stop condoning violent criminal offenses, and stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs immediately,"" she added."

"Feature: In Chaos, some young people sing a different tune in Hong Kong","by Xinhua writers Bai Xu, Yao Yuan and Ding Ziyi
HONG KONG, Oct. 2 (Xinhua) -- When black-clad radicals went on rampage in Hong Kong to vandalize facilities and torch the Chinese national flag, there were youngsters here who braved the hostility to compose a patriotic song.
""Tribulation of the past, brewing a thousand years of soil; in glory there flow blood and sweat from toil,"" Ting Ching-hoi and his band Hody-Listen wrote in ""The Republican Land"", which they dedicated as a gift to the 70th founding anniversary of the People's Republic of China.
""With the song I would like to send a message that there are lots of young people in Hong Kong who love our country dearly,"" he told Xinhua.
Ting admitted that composing a patriotic song was not easy now, given the current situation.
The ongoing unrest and violent acts have been rocking the Asian trading and financial hub for more than three months, posing serious threat to the safety of members of the public, and they have also seriously undermined social order.
""I was saddened by what happened in the past weeks and also by the fact that quite a few young people in Hong Kong have such a biased opinion of the (Chinese) mainland,"" Ting said. ""So it occurred to me that maybe I could do something.""
Xinhua talked to many young people here recently and found that although some watch Douyin, or Tik Tok, a social media video app for creating and sharing short video footage, while others use Alibaba's online shopping platforms such as Taobao, their understanding of the country appeared to be limited.
""My guitarist William Lee used to have misunderstanding about China,"" Ting Ching-hoi said. ""By doing research before composing the song, his perception changed a lot.""
Before Lee embarked on his first visit to the mainland last year, his mother was so nervous that she offered to buy him a life insurance. But her perception was later changed by Lee as well.
""Students in Hong Kong do not know much about the (Chinese) mainland, because history was just an optional subject in middle schools,"" Ting said. ""Many would not choose the course, because it wouldn't help them find a good job in the future.""
In October 2017, Carrie Lam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, announced the Chinese history to become an independent compulsory subject for junior high students, starting in the 2018/19 school year.
Before that, teachers would normally encourage students to learn more about the contemporary society in the course of ""liberal studies"".
Ting recalled when he had the course in middle school, one chapter was about self identity.
""We were asked to choose from being 'a Hong Konger in China', 'a Chinese in Hong Kong', and 'a British in Hong Kong', etc. And we were told that there is no right answer.""
This is different from even the West, where students would learn about their countries at a young age, and sing the national anthem on various occasions including regular school assemblies, Ting said.
In the interviews, some Hong Kong teachers and principals, who refused to be named for fear of being attacked by radical protesters, admitted that the education is flawed.
A senior teacher, who was the head of a liberal studies panel in a secondary school, said that the subject was initially designed to encourage students to read news and pay more attention to politics.
""Since there is no uniform textbook, schools and teachers have to search for their own teaching material,"" he said. ""So the position of a school as well as a teacher's own judgement can largely affect their teaching.""
Another expert of liberal studies told Xinhua on condition of anonymity that to save time, some teachers would grab something most handy, such as media reports.
""If reports are biased, how could the teachers remain objective?"" he asked.
A college teacher showed Xinhua the websites they normally use to collect teaching information. After browsing the websites, Xinhua reporters found that the articles about the Chinese mainland were largely negative, such as vaccine scandal, smog and growing urban waste.
Yau Yat, a historian, pointed out that some media in Hong Kong like to feast on negative reports of the mainland. ""If all the things students discussed are negative, they would form a perception and grow up with bias,"" he said.
His worries were by no means unfounded.
A 17-year-old middle school student surnamed Chou was among the protesters. ""They say if I don't join them (to protest against the proposed ordinance amendments concerning fugitive offenders transfers), in the future when I say something improper, I will be thrown into jail in the mainland,"" she said, citing media reports she read in liberal studies class to justify her view.
Ting said he always suggested his friends actually go to the mainland to have a look. ""Seeing is believing.""
He is currently working on another song, ""1842"", which tells the history of Hong Kong being separated from China under the Treaty of Nanking.
Some friends kindly warned him to be careful so as not to be attacked by radical protesters.
""Wherever we go, we have but one motherland,"" Ting said. He hoped that his songs could be inspirational to the young people in Hong Kong.
""Make your appeals in a rational way and work hard for the future of Hong Kong and the motherland. That's the real meaningful thing,"" said he. (Xinhua reporters Wang Xin, Annie Cheung and Zhao Ruixi contributed to the story.)"

"Xinhua Headlines: Zoom in on cyber platforms that spread ""black terror"" in Hong Kong","HONG KONG, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) -- Amid increasingly ugly violence by black-clad rioters in Hong Kong since June, some online platforms have become places where riots are plotted, rumors are spread and ""black terror"" is nurtured.
Among them, the encrypted instant messaging app Telegram and online forum LIHKG are considered the most notorious ones, cashing in on Hong Kong's plight as radicals feast on a plethora of incendiary calls, obscenities, and tutorials on committing crimes.
INCUBATOR FOR VIOLENCE
Rioters mainly use Telegram for plotting and communication, and LIHKG for generating rallying cries and other propaganda to glorify violence.
It took as little as a few days or even hours to materialize a rioting activity by using Telegram and LIHKG.
Certain procedures were followed: Before riots started, organizers would release offensive tactics, including assigning roles, positions and equipment to participants; as riots began, they would monitor police deployment and operations in real-time and prepare backup resources and emergency responses for potential arrests; and after the riots, they had vehicles ready to pick up the key frontline rioters.
Sources said Telegram served as the leading platform for ""inner circle decision-making"" for demonstrators to receive instructions and make action plans, while LIHKG is used mainly for ""outer circle decision-making"" to mobilize the vast number of netizens and demonstrators with action initiatives.
The core decision-making group on Telegram is, in fact, radicals' command center of the so-called ""spontaneous"" protests.
On Telegram, small groups were created to monitor police movements, collect and distribute materials, study how to deal with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government and the police, dox personal and family information of police officers, and recruit propaganda personnel.
They continuously came up with action plans via different groups or channels on Telegram and LIHKG, set the direction and agenda for the demonstrations, and then instigated more people and netizens to participate.
As a protest or a riot unfolded, Telegram was then widely used for real-time contact, instant sharing and spreading instructions and other related information among different groups on the two platforms to support on-site demonstrators.
For their online propaganda, demonstrators used multiple languages to glorify themselves and defame the police.
A propaganda advisory group involving foreigners is active on Telegram to help demonstrators modify their slogans and other propaganda materials.
After wreaking havoc, organizers and participants would poll on LIHKG to assess its effects and adjust their tactics accordingly. Some recounted their own experience, telling others the do's and don'ts. Some drummed up statements to agitate the public for the next round of escalated actions.
ONLINE TRAINING CAMP
While used by radicals to plot violence, Telegram and LIHKG have also become the online training camp for rioters, with substantial posts and how-to manuals inciting violence.
Telegram and LIHKG are flooded with illustrations and videos from overseas teaching radicals how to make and use Molotov cocktails, smoke bombs, projectiles with corrosive powder or liquid, giant slingshots and homemade bombs and other homemade weapons.
In a series of raids, Hong Kong police have busted several cases related to bomb-making in recent months.
Besides posts about weapon-making techniques, Telegram and LIHKG also provide platforms for rioters to organize and receive training before taking to the streets.
For example, a post on LIHKG analyzed the riot control tactics of the law enforcement forces, with elaborate illustrations and videos of crowd control training, to help rioters fight the police and avoid arrests.
Telegram groups and channels are also full of posts recruiting people to take part in fight training taught by foreign trainers, or advocating vandalism and vigilante attacks on those who have differing opinions.
These online tutorials soon became crimes on the street.
Advocated techniques were widely used by rioters on the ground to assault police officers and police stations.
On Oct. 1, a rioter used an iron pipe to hit the right arm of a police officer who had pulled out a gun as a warning. The attack was exactly one of the tactics so-called ""experts"" on LIHKG teach on assaulting police.
In another attack on Oct. 13, a rioter slashed the neck of a police officer from behind with a box cutter, which resembled the methods for cut-throat attacks introduced on LIHKG.
CATALYST FOR SOCIAL RESENTMENT
Since June, as violence in Hong Kong intensifies, the Hong Kong police force has become animosity targets. A large number of frontline police officers and their families became victims of cyberbullying.
Privacy information of more than 2,600 officers and their families, illegally obtained, has been disclosed in detail on Telegram, LIHKG and other social media, including their home address, names of their spouses, and schools of their children, according to the Hong Kong police.
Threats against police officers like ""kill their whole family"" and ""their wives and children will be harmed"" are all over the two platforms, while radicals instigated harassment, cyberbullying or even attacks.
In the prolonged chaos, rumors were cooked up and spread on Telegram and LIHKG to glorify violent acts, defame police officers, and disseminate misinformation and hatred against police.
Numerous rumors targeting the police proved to be pure malicious slanders, such as so-called ""undercover police officers hurling petrol bombs"" or ""officers beating protesters to death in Prince Edward Station on Aug. 31.""
When rioters plotted violence or disseminated rumors via Telegram or LIHKG, they intentionally used anonymity or pseudonyms to hide their identities.
CALLS FOR LEGAL REGULATION
Under Hong Kong's Crimes Ordinance, a seditious intention, such as bringing hatred or contempt against the government, promoting feelings of ill-will and enmity between different classes of the population, or inciting violence, is liable to imprisonment once convicted.
""Cyberspace should also be subject to legal regulation. The premise of a free market is that everyone abides by the law,"" said Leung Mei-fun, a member of the HKSAR Legislative Council.
She noted that Hong Kong has enough legal basis for punishment, referring to certain recent law-violating online content that abets crimes or teaches how to make bombs.
The rule of law is the cornerstone of Hong Kong's success, experts said, adding that relevant ordinance applies to cyberspace too and any law violation must be investigated, regardless of whether it is online or offline.
Leung cited similar cases in common law jurisdictions that offer examples to follow. For instance, U.S. websites would be shut down if they spread hate speech against the United States. Also, last week, a Spanish judge ordered the closure of a website suspected to have organized street demonstrations through social media and encrypted applications.
Ma Yan-kwok, barrister and chairman of the Hong Kong Legal Exchange Foundation, said some online forums have overstepped the bottom line of freedom of speech and are suspected of an offense of sedition, adding the use of the internet to instigate violent assaults is an even more serious felony.
Inciting riots carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison while inciting others to murder, such as teaching or instigating others to cut the neck of a police officer, is liable to a maximum sentence of life in prison, Ma added.
He said in Hong Kong, the major problem is that law enforcement is too weak to deter crimes, where legal procedures are lengthy and uncertain. The behind-the-scene suspects are usually left unidentified.
Refuting the rhetoric that defends the online crimes with freedom of speech, Leung said as stipulated in the international conventions on human rights, freedom of speech has always been within the framework of legal constraints and should be properly restricted for the protection of national security, public order, public health or morals."
Chinese community in Ghana gathers against violence in Hong Kong,"ACCRA, Aug. 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese community in Ghana gathered here Sunday to protest the violent acts in Hong Kong, China.
The gathering called for peace in Hong Kong with people holding placards saying ""We love China"" and ""We love Hong Kong.""
Chinese Ambassador to Ghana Wang Shiting urged foreign countries to stop interfering in China's internal affairs. ""I want to reiterate that Hong Kong is part of China, so foreign forces must stop interfering in China's affairs.""
""Evidence shows that, but for the interference and incitement by foreign forces, the situation in Hong Kong would not have deteriorated to this level,"" Wang added."
Backgrounder: Anti-mask legislation adopted in recent years,"BEIJING, Oct. 5 (Xinhua) -- An anti-mask law established by the government of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) came into effect on Saturday to end violence and restore order in the Asian financial hub.
HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam told a press conference Friday that the government has invoked the power under the Emergency Regulations Ordinance and passed the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation to ""create a deterrent effect against masked, violent protesters and rioters.""
Many countries have similar anti-mask legislations, including Britain, Russia, Canada, Australia, France and the United States.
Following a series of riots in many British cities in August 2011, Britain temporarily reintroduced anti-mask laws, giving the police the power to remove face masks and other covering from rioters.
The amendments of the Russian federal law on assemblies, meetings, demonstrations, marches and picketing as of June 2012 demand that participants in a public event do not conceal their faces, including through the use of masks and other means of disguise to hide one's identity.
Those who fail to comply with the lawful request can be temporarily detained for investigation, the law said.
On June 19, 2013, Canada's parliament passed the Preventing Persons from Concealing Their Identity during Riots and Unlawful Assemblies Act (Bill C-309).
The law bans the wearing of masks during a riot or illegal assembly, and carries a penalty of up to ten years in prison.
Australia's state of Victoria passed laws in September 2017 to prohibit the covering of faces in violent protests. Those who commit violence while wearing a face mask could get 15 years behind bars.
""This legislation will make it clear that if you commit these violent offences with face covering on, you'll get even longer periods in prison,"" said then Victorian Attorney-General Martin Pakula.
The French government introduced an anti-riot law in April 2019, which bans covering one's face during a demonstration that disrupts public order. A conviction under the law can lead to a sentence of up to one year in prison and a fine of 15,000 euros.
In the United States, at least 15 states prohibit protesters from wearing masks. In New York State, the anti-mask law bans wearing masks or any manner of disguise during demonstrations.
In Arizona State, lawmakers revamped a bill in early 2018 which bans wearing a disguise during protests and public events. Offenders wearing a mask when damaging property will face more time in prison than those who do not cover their faces."
Roundup: Azerbaijani experts denounce rioters' violent behavior in Hong Kong,"BAKU, Aug. 27 (Xinhua) -- Azerbaijani political analysts, in recent interviews with Xinhua, have denounced Hong Kong rioters' violent acts and called on the administration to raise public awareness of the rule of law.
Political analyst Ilgar Velizade told Xinhua on Tuesday that the Chinese port city has long benefited from the ""one country, two systems"" principle, and continuously functions as a gateway for overseas investors and exporters to China.
This role has put Hong Kong at the top of economy and finance ratings for years, Velizade said, warning that this achievement could be ruined by the ongoing turmoil.
Destructive acts by rioters, the ongoing protests, and the threat of chaos, unrest and illegal activities that have almost paralyzed the city could trigger an outflow of investment, even an economic recession, which will profoundly impact the lives of ordinary people, the expert said.
He said that China's numerous friends around the world, including those in Azerbaijan, hope for the restoration of peace and stability as soon as possible in Hong Kong.
Another analyst, Elkhan Shahinoglu, told Xinhua on Tuesday that it is important for the Chinese port city to take such measures as campaigns to promote the essence of Hong Kong Basic Law and local laws.
""The escalation of the unrest will be disadvantageous for all,"" he said.
Shahinoglu, who also heads the Atlas Research Center for political studies, praised China's ""one country, two systems"" principle, which has been the cornerstone of Hong Kong's social stability and its way of life.
He warned that foreign forces, including some media, are taking advantage of the ongoing situation with an aim to create chaos in the city."
Spotlight: U.S. Hong Kong-related acts criticized by global experts,"HONG KONG, Oct. 25 (Xinhua) -- Global observers hit out at the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 and other related acts pushed by U.S. lawmakers, stressing the bills were groundless and biased and could only compound the prolonged unrest in Hong Kong.
NEEDLESS BILLS
David Gosset, a French expert and founder of the Europe-China Forum, thought the acts were groundless. ""In Hong Kong, a highly developed Chinese region, the fundamental rights are well protected.""
It is ongoing violent and extremist acts that damaged people's rights and should be condemned, Gosset said.
""I think it's a very unwise move by the United States congress, which is not going to help with the matters, but only provoke, making things worse for Hong Kong in the long run,"" said Kishore Mahbubani, distinguished fellow at Asia Research Institute of National University of Singapore.
The Hong Kong-related bills still require the support of the U.S. Senate and then the U.S. president to become a law.
""I doubt whether it will achieve that and I don't personally anticipate it becoming a law,"" said Martin Jacques, senior fellow at the Department of Politics and International Studies of University of Cambridge.
TRUE MOTIVE BEHIND
By pushing for the acts, the United States is brutally intervening in China's internal affairs in pursuit of its own interests, scholars said.
""While protesting about what it claims that Russian interference in its presidential elections, the United States itself is absolutely openly intervening in Hong Kong,"" John Ross, former director of Economic and Business Policy of London said, calling the inconsistency ""absolutely ridiculous.""
Ross said key figures in so-called protests, actually riots, like Joshua Wong have been visiting the United States and have been supported.
""Some countries including the United States tried to gain their own interests and promote their own views on international affairs,"" Victor Larin, vice chairman of the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences said.
Larin pointed out that the U.S. politicians are leveraging the situation in Hong Kong for their own political and economic goals.
DOUBLE STANDARDS
""Western countries would just never endorse the behavior that was right here in their own country,"" Jacques said. ""It's only been used as a stick to beat China with.""
While the situation in Hong Kong was still under control, rampant riots broke out in many other places in the world, including Spain and Chile. In some foreign cases, protesters were killed and tanks were deployed.
""The U.S. congress should be condemning what is going on in those places at the present time, rather than Hong Kong,"" Ross said. ""This is just a typical example of hypocrisy and it's why nobody can take seriously American statements about human rights and so on because they're so obviously biased.""
Ross said the rioters are in essence demanding Hong Kong's secession from China, which also goes against the belief of the United States.
""Abraham Lincoln, who is considered the greatest president in American history, unleashed the army against the South trying to secede from the United States,"" Ross said. ""The point is that the secession was never allowed for the United States.""
A STABLE HONG KONG BENEFITS ALL
""We all share an interest in the success of Hong Kong, which is such an important economic center of the world and Asia, and we need a Hong Kong that continues to be successful,"" Jim Wunderman, president and CEO of the Bay Area Council, a public policy and advocacy organization based in San Francisco, said.
Wunderman said American companies are very hopeful for a resolution of the challenges being faced in Hong Kong. ""Our companies are very committed to the relationships that they have here. The sooner the issues can get resolved the better.""
""We hope that Hong Kong will continue to be a center of international trade,"" Joan McEntee, former Under Secretary of Commerce of the United States, said.
McEntee in particular mentioned the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. ""Hong Kong, as an integral part of the Greater Bay Area, can enjoy a very positive opportunity."""
"Interview: Some Western countries try to ""fan flames"" in Hong Kong, says Russian expert","MOSCOW, Aug. 26 (Xinhua) -- Some Western countries are taking advantage of the situation in China's Hong Kong and trying to stir up tensions in the city and incite confrontation, a Russian expert has said.
In a recent interview with Xinhua, Alexei Maslov, head of the Oriental Studies Department of the Russian Higher School of Economics Research University, warned that the ongoing protests have ""completely lost rationality."" 
Some in the West are trying to destabilize the situation there, ""fan flames,"" and use the young people in Hong Kong to raise the wave against China,"" said Maslov.
He praised the Chinese government's efforts to ease the ongoing tensions, which he believed showed prudence and ability.
The expert said that the Western response to this matter is neither polite nor correct.
Maslov said that China has remained committed to maintaining the autonomy of the city in a number of spheres during the years, and it is irresponsible and unprofessional for some people who don't really understand the situation in Hong Kong to comment on the issue from ""the completely Western point of view.""
Maslov warned that the current crisis could deal a great blow to the business circle in Hong Kong, making the place ""unstable in the financial and political sense."""

"Interview: Color revolution only causes political, economic destruction, even civil war, says Russian scholar","MOSCOW, Oct. 9 (Xinhua) -- What happened in Ukraine shows that color revolutions only lead to political and economic upheaval and even civil wars, said a Russian scholar.
""The main danger of color revolutions is putting a country with all its people and resources under external control,"" Andrei Manoilo, a professor of political science with Moscow State University, said in a recent interview with Xinhua.
A color revolution, he added, is a political scheme by external forces to intentionally stir up political instability and then bring about a regime change.
The primary tactic is to exert pressure on the governing authorities through political blackmail and instigation of youth protests, said Manoilo, noting that the strategy was applied in Ukraine during the Orange Revolution in 2004-2005 and the Euromaidan protests in 2013-2014.
The professor pointed out that the case of Ukraine shows that a country hit by color revolutions will lose its autonomy and suffer ""a systemic plunder of the country"" in economic terms.
In addition, color revolutions very often create the ground for civil wars, and those behind the color revolutions can hardly wait to fan the flames, because with that kind of conflict it is much easier for them to control the territory, Manoilo said.
""A civil war means victims, destruction, loss of lives and deaths of children,"" he said.
Should a color revolution succeed with a coup, puppets would come to power, but that will not be the end of it, added the political expert.
""For a certain period of time, these puppets retain the romantic and revolutionary image of reformers and heroes. But the illusion will be torn into pieces by reality in 3-4 years,"" Manoilo said.
Then new protesters would rise against them, which could turn into a new color revolution driven by foreign forces, he said, adding that the vicious spiral would weaken and even split the country.
Noting that some foreign forces have been trying to engineer a color revolution in China's Hong Kong, Manoilo said he believes there are two plots at play.
One is to use the Hong Kong situation to undermine China's political stability and exert pressure on Beijing before it holds the final negotiations on a trade deal with the United Sates, he said.
The other, he added, is to practice the color revolution tactics in Hong Kong and later apply them to China's border areas like Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, so as to make greater trouble for China."
1st LD Writethru: Foreign legislatures should not interfere in any form in Hong Kong affairs: HKSAR gov't,"HONG KONG, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- The government of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Wednesday expressed regret over the U.S. House of Representatives' passage of acts and a resolution concerning Hong Kong, reiterating that foreign legislatures should not interfere in any form in the internal affairs of the HKSAR.
Responding to the passage of the acts and the resolution, a spokesman of the HKSAR government said as the best arrangement for maintaining Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability and for making Hong Kong a favorable place to live and work in, the ""one country, two systems"" principle has been fully and successfully implemented in Hong Kong since its return to the motherland.
The HKSAR has been exercising ""Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong"" and a high degree of autonomy in strict accordance with the Basic Law of the HKSAR of the People's Republic of China, the spokesman said in a statement. 
Human rights and freedoms in Hong Kong are fully protected by the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and other legislation, in addition to the Basic Law, the spokesman said, stressing the HKSAR government attaches great importance to human rights and freedoms and is determined to safeguard them because it's a constitutional duty of the HKSAR government.
Article 4 of the Basic Law stipulates that the HKSAR shall safeguard the rights and freedoms of the residents of the HKSAR and of other persons in the HKSAR in accordance with the law. Also, the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as applied to Hong Kong shall remain in force.
Chief Executive of the HKSAR Carrie Lam announced on Sept. 4 that the HKSAR government would formally withdraw the amendments concerning the transfer of fugitive offenders, the spokesman said.
Over the past few months, violent protests and illegal incidents have caused damage to district and community facilities as well as injury to members of the public, according to the spokesman.
In response, the Hong Kong police have been exercising restraint and carrying out enforcement actions in strict accordance with the law to protect the life and property of the general public, bring offenders to justice and restore public order as soon as possible, the spokesman said.
The Independent Police Complaints Council is conducting a fact-finding study on the handling of large-scale public order events since June, including corresponding actions by the police, to ascertain the facts and will prepare a report that will be made public, the spokesman said.
Concerning constitutional development and universal suffrage, the community needs to engage in dialogues, premised on the legal basis and under a peaceful atmosphere with mutual trust, with a view to narrowing differences and attaining a consensus agreeable to all sides, the spokesman said.
The HKSAR government will assess the situation carefully and take forward constitutional development in accordance with the Basic Law and the relevant Interpretation and Decisions of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the spokesman said."

After addressing the 42nd session of the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council earlier in the day, the woman representative was invited by the UN correspondents' association (ACANU) to talk about the situation in Hong Kong.
For months, radical protests and violent activities have drawn people's attention and raised concern about the stability of the international financial hub.
People cannot conduct regular affairs anymore, she lamented.
""My traveling is significantly hindered. I had to change my airplane simply just because now they are starting to threaten to do more damage, not just to the airport,"" Ho noted.
As a business leader in the city, Ho said that in the economic sense, the hardest hit by the radicals were ""many small businesses, including the mom-and-pop shops, especially eateries and small shops.""
""We should be sitting down and reflecting and expressing,"" she said, adding that although the Hong Kong people have this freedom, some radicals just chose not to use it but rather to create so much havoc, holding hostage other people's freedom and rights to live a normal life.
All Hong Kong people need to learn something from reviewing what happened this summer in the city, and make ""the right interpretation of freedom,"" she said.
The Hong Kong Federation of Women would like to call for an end to the violence, and urge the formation of ""a platform for stronger dialogue,"" she said."
Hong Kong police says will not use force if not attacked by protesters,"HONG KONG, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Hong Kong police officer said on Friday that the police will not use force if they do not face violent attacks by protesters.
Yeung Man-pun, commander of Kowloon City District, made the remarks at a press briefing when replying a question concerning the police's handling of the protests in the past two months.
When asked if the police force bears any responsibility for the increasing violence, Yeung said, ""I think you have to set your logic correct. We are responsive. If there are no violent charging at our check lines, no one attacking us, attacking our police station, we are not gonna use force to stop it.""
Responding to another question, Yeung said, ""We (the police force) all face tremendous pressure, long working hours, and arduous working conditions.""
He also expressed confidence that the police is capable of maintaining law and order in Hong Kong.

"Interview: ""One country, two systems"" ensures long-term prosperity for Hong Kong, says former Egyptian PM","by Marwa Yahya
CAIRO, Oct. 7 (Xinhua) -- The ""one country, two systems"" principle has been widely recognized as a success for the Chinese city of Hong Kong, said former Egyptian Prime Minister Essam Sharaf in an interview with Xinhua.
Noting that Hong Kong has always been part of China, Sharaf said Hong Kong's return to the motherland in 1997 is critical to its fate, as the ""one country, two systems"" policy has ""maintained the long-term prosperity and stability of the city.""
Commenting on the recent unrest in Hong Kong, Sharaf said ""when matters escalated to violence, no doubt hidden hands were behind it,"" adding ""the people of Hong Kong aren't violent or provocative by nature.""
He called on the Hong Kong government and residents to bring calm to the city.
The violent protests are not aimed at expressing a difference of opinion but to violate China's sovereignty over Hong Kong, he said. ""Some foreign powers were waiting for a simple crack to work on enlarging it.""
Sharaf described some Western media coverage of the protests as ""unfair"" and responsible for provoking the riots.
The escalation of the situation is aimed at hindering China's development and rise in the international arena, especially when many countries and international organizations welcome China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the former prime minister said.
Sharaf said he believes that countries and international organizations should show their support for China, since the prolonged violence in Hong Kong could hurt China and its friends in the long run.
It's the right time to stand with China, as ""many countries believe that China could create a different world based on a new governance model and usher in a better future for the coming generations,"" he said.
Sharaf said support for China means ""application of international laws that stipulate non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other countries."""
"Violence ""very disruptive"" to Hong Kong's stability, economic wellbeing: U.S. expert","NEW YORK, Aug. 27 (Xinhua) -- A leading U.S. expert on China warned that the ongoing violence in Hong Kong is ""very disruptive"" to its stability and economic wellbeing, which is ""the absolute pinnacle"" of this land of business opportunity.
""You see that the violence (in Hong Kong) is a serious problem and it's very disruptive for (its) stability, which is the foundation of economic development,"" said Robert Lawrence Kuhn, chairman of the Kuhn Foundation in an interview with Xinhua on Monday.
""I would say, and many would say that violence is never good. Any violence would undermine dealing with those real issues. And rule of law is the foundation of civil society,"" Kuhn said, when asked about the recent violent protests in this Chinese port city.
""But it's also critical to understand why Hong Kong is important for all of China and what are the red lines that China would not allow to be breached to get a real understanding of what's happening,"" Kuhn said.
The veteran China expert believes there are ""three red lines"" that China will not allow to be breached.
The first is ""certainly any move towards independence or what I call quasi-independence won't be allowed,"" he said.
The second is that the Chinese central government ""will not allow Hong Kong to be used as kind of a base to undermine the political system of the mainland,"" he said.
And the third is that China ""won't allow unending chaos to go on forever because that undermines everything,"" he said.
Hong Kong can not afford to miss the development opportunity arising from the outline development plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area unveiled by the central government in February.
""It is the best opportunity for Hong Kong's future,"" Kuhn said. ""I would exaggerate to make a statement that ... Hong Kong really doesn't have a significant economic future outside of this integrated plan.""
Covering a total area of 56,000 square km, the Greater Bay Area has a combined population of about 70 million in 2017, when its gross domestic product reached around 10 trillion yuan (1.48 trillion U.S. dollars)."
Moscow calls for joint cooperation with Beijing against U.S. interference,"MOSCOW, Aug. 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia and China should exchange information on the interference of the United States in the internal affairs of the two countries, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Friday.

""Moreover, I think it would be right and useful to exchange such information through respective services,"" Zakharova said, adding that she and her Chinese colleagues will discuss the issue soon.
Zakharova said the United States' secret service is using technology to destabilize Russia and China.
Earlier on Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said it had summoned U.S. Embassy Political Section head Tim Richardson, and presented him with an official protest against the U.S. encouraging an unauthorized opposition rally on Aug. 3.
The ministry criticized the United States for attempting to interfere in Russia's domestic affairs.
Also on Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying called on the U.S. side to immediately stop intervening in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs.
On Thursday, the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region lodged stern representations with the U.S. Consulate General in Hong Kong after a diplomat at the consulate general reportedly met with ""Hong Kong independence"" activists."
Fake reporters obstruct officers on duty: Hong Kong police,"HONG KONG, Sept. 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police officers who are responsible for media liaison said some protesters had been using fake identities to pose as reporters during demonstrations to obstruct police from performing duties.
During the protests in the past three months, some protesters wearing yellow press vests often stood in the way of police lines to disturb police operations, officers with the media liaison team said Friday.
The media liaison team of the police, with main responsibilities of assisting police operations and serving as a bridge between the police and the press, has 200 officers who have been dispatched over 1,500 times since June.
""If a reporter is surrounded by protesters and if they are in a dangerous situation, we will help them leave the scene,"" said an officer surnamed Cheung.
During an illegal gathering on July 28, the police fired tear gas to disperse violent protesters. But one of the journalists did not have time to retreat and felt intense eye pain. Cheung helped him find water in the nearby building to rinse his eyes.
Ko Chun Pong, a superintendent of Hong Kong Police Public Relations Branch, said reporters are advised to keep an appropriate distance from police during their operations.
Violent protesters who charged police lines and vandalized public facilities often put lives of the others on site in danger. On several occasions, reporters' clothes caught fire from burning petrol bombs thrown by the rioters.
On Aug. 3, Ko was hit in the chest by a brick thrown by protesters and had to receive treatment in a hospital.
The officers said when they attempted to arrest offenders, fake reporters used their cameras and elbows to block officers from carrying out their duties, with some even insulting the officers with very offensive language. On one occasion, steel balls were fired from the area where the journalists gathered.
""When we suspect people are fake journalists, we will ask for their credentials and persuade them to leave. But the frontline situation is rather precarious and it is very difficult to discern every fake journalist,"" added Cheung."

"Commentary: Challenging ""one country, two systems"" deserves punishment","BEIJING, Aug. 21 (Xinhua) -- As recent protests and violence took place in Hong Kong, some violent protestors preached ""Hong Kong independence,"" flagrantly offending national dignity, and severely challenging the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
The increasing violent acts of the anti-China rabble-rousers in the region have seriously infringed on the basic rights of the public, and dealt heavy blows to local industries such as aviation, retailing and tourism.
Some of the rioters blatantly attacked the police, and battered Hong Kong residents and travelers from the mainland, with complete disregard for the damage they have done to the region.
To implement the ""one country, two systems"" principle, there are three bottom lines that cannot be touched. There is no room for any activity that harms the security of national sovereignty, challenges the power of the central government and the authority of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, or takes advantage of Hong Kong to infiltrate and damage the Chinese mainland.
If anyone dares to act against the three bottom lines, their political schemes will be met with nothing but complete failure, and they will be held liable accordingly, which is beyond any doubt.
The lawbreakers who blatantly challenge the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle must be held accountable legally, and those responsible for the orchestration, organization and manipulation of such acts must bear criminal liability.
All in all, if the anti-China rabble-rousers in Hong Kong continue down the wrong path, what awaits them will be the harshest legal punishment."
"2nd LD Writethru: Rioters set fires, attack police, paralyze traffic in Hong Kong","HONG KONG, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong was hit by a fresh bout of violence on Tuesday when black-clad rioters damaged properties, attacked police, set fires and paralyzed traffic.
The unrest started with unauthorized assemblies in areas including Wan Chai, Sham Shui Po, Tuen Mun, Sha Tin, Tsuen Wan and Wong Tai Sin.
Some rioters hurled multiple petrol bombs at police officers, along with other objects. A number of Molotov cocktails were mistakenly landed on other protesters' umbrellas.
Local TV channels also showed them beating police with clubs and umbrellas.
As the level of violence escalated, some rioters sprayed corrosive fluid at the police, injuring several police officers and reporters. Photographs of an officer who had his chest and arm burnt by the fluid and a hand bleeding were posted on social media.
In Wan Chai, mobsters torched a national flag at a tram station. In Wong Tai Sin, they set fire to electric bikes.
Rioters stormed the Tsuen Wan Government Offices at about 6 p.m., throwing petrol bombs and destroyed the ceiling and bulletins.
A number of shops were vandalized, including at least one China Mobile outlet, a Bank of China branch office and an Arome Bakery.
In Tsuen Wan, rioters set a mahjong parlor ablaze and painted characters of ""gangsters"" on the shutter.
At about 7:30 p.m. local time, rioters forced open a snack store of Best Mart 360. They swept all items to the floor with iron sticks. Many wine bottles were smashed and the shop was teeming with a strong smell.
Traffic was disrupted as rioters set up blockade with trash cans, dismantled iron railings and burning stuff.
On Tuesday evening, rioters set fires to entrances of several MTR stations including the Causeway Bay, Tsuen Wan and Tai Wai. The surveillance camera in Tsuen Wan station was damaged.
A Mandarin-speaking man in gray T-shirt was beaten up by a swarm of rioters in Mong Kok, with blood on his head. Witnesses said that he was taking photos, which angered the rioters.
Police said after repeated warnings in vain, they have ""deployed tear gas and appropriate force"" to disperse the rioters.
An 18-year-old man was shot in the shoulder when he attacked a police officer with an iron stick. ""The police officers' lives were under serious threat,"" said a police spokeswoman. The police officer shot the man to save his colleague and himself, she said. The man's life is not in danger now.
Police advised Hong Kong residents to refrain from going out and urged those outdoors to return home as soon as possible. The prolonged unrest in Hong Kong has seriously disrupted people's normal life and hurt local economy.

The Asian trading and financial hub has been plagued since June by unrest that originated from protests over the proposed ordinance amendments concerning fugitive offenders transfers.

At around 6:30 p.m. local time, some radical protesters began charging the police cordon line and shined laser beams at police officers at the entrance of the HKSAR goverment headquarters complex.
At around 7:30 p.m., a large group of protesters blocked the carriageways in nearby Harcourt Road, paralyzing the traffic.
Some violent protesters damaged properties outside the goverment headquarters complex and aimed laser beams at a helicopter, posing serious threat to the safety of everyone at scene, according to Hong Kong police.

"Interview: Hong Kong MTR under strain amid prolonged violence, says CEO","HONG KONG, Sept. 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway (MTR) operator has pleaded for an end to the prolonged violence, in which radical protesters have vandalized dozens of its stations.
Jacob Kam, chief executive officer (CEO) of the MTR Corporation, said over 88 MTR and light rail stations have been damaged by radicals in the past few months that saw violent protests.
""Violence and vandalism have been escalating in the past few months, forcing train services to stop several times,"" Kam said in an interview with Xinhua.
More than 1,000 pieces of equipment have been damaged and the loss has mounted to nearly 40 million HK dollars (5.1 million U.S. dollars), according to Kam.
With over 90 stations and more than 60 light rail stops, the MTR system handles more than 5.4 million passengers every day, shouldering nearly half of the public transport volume in the Asian financial hub.
The public transport system has been one of the main targets of rioters, who torn down CCTV cameras, vandalized ticketing machines, blocked and set fires to MTR station exits, and forced trains to ground by obstructing carriage doors.
On Sept. 15, MTR stations at Admiralty, Wan Chai and Causeway Bay were forced to close after the rioters smashed the glass inside the stations, damaged and obstructed MTR exits after an illegal rally veered into violence.
The MTR chief said particularly excruciating was the taunting and bullying that the MTR staff suffered as they tried to stop vandalism or separate passengers from violent protesters.
""In one extreme case, the demonstrators stormed into a station, besieged our staff and shouted abusive language to them for six hours,"" he said.
The company has publicly deplored the violent acts and obtained a court injunction to restrain riotous behaviors and unlawful acts that disrupt the service and damage the property at MTR stations.
However, violent acts continued to grow in severity, prompting the MTR to expand its security team from over 100 people to 500-600.
If violence continues to escalate, the MTR will work closer together with the police and assist the police in enforcing the law, he said.
And while the MTR has stepped up repairs of damaged facilities, the CEO said the damage was so severe and extensive that the deployment of equipment was under great strain.
""People in Hong Kong rely heavily on public transport, especially the MTR, so we are trying our best to maintain the MTR operation,"" Kam said."

Strong measures should be taken as the chaos is not only bad for Hong Kong's economy and tourism, but also disadvantageous for the prosperity of the East Asian region as Hong Kong is an important finance and trade center, he said.
It is illogical, unreasonable and illusory for the anti-government protesters to demand that Hong Kong be granted a Western-style political system which its former colonizers the British government never granted, the analyst said.
He warned that Hong Kong should avoid being negatively perceived by China or international investors as a hotbed of toxic politics, instability and social chaos.
Hong Kong needs help from the Chinese mainland for its long-term viability and prosperity, the analyst said, noting that the region in the past prospered due to its stable political environment and efficiency as a trade, finance, services and logistics hub."

HKSAR justice secretary says due consideration given to human rights in devising anti-mask regulation,"HONG KONG, Oct. 13 (Xinhua) -- The secretary for justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government stressed on Sunday that the anti-mask regulation will help reduce act of violence and in devising the new regulation the HKSAR government has given due consideration to human rights guarantees.
In a blog article published on the website of the HKSAR government's Department of Justice, Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng said that in devising the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation, the government has given due consideration to the human rights guarantees in the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, including the rights on the freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and privacy.
""However, these rights are not absolute, and may be subject to restrictions that satisfy the proportionality test including whether a reasonable balance has been struck between the societal benefits of the encroachment and the inroads made into the constitutionally protected rights of the individual,"" she pointed out.
The new measure would not deprive the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly as people are still free to participate in lawful and peaceful public order events without face covering. If a member of the public in a public place is asked by police officers to remove the face covering to verify his identity, he may wear it again after the verification process is completed, said Cheng.
""Interference with a person's rights is minimal, and in any event proportionate to the legitimate aim of protecting public safety and public order,"" she said.
Other than the specified circumstances set out in the new regulation, people are generally free to wear face masks and the impact on their daily lives is limited, she added.
The secretary for justice also clarified that in enacting the anti-mask regulation, there is no issue of the Legislative Council being circumvented. ""The new regulation, which is a piece of subsidiary legislation, is made pursuant to the Emergency Regulations Ordinance and has to be laid on the table of the Legislative Council which may by resolution amend the regulation,"" she said.
Cheng pointed out that prohibiting persons from using face covering would facilitate police investigation and administration of justice and would as well deter them from acting in an unlawful manner on the basis that they may act with impunity by concealing their identity.
""The protests and confrontations have continued for almost four months. We hope that the new measure could help curb the spread of violence and restore social order. We also urge the understanding and support of the public in our work,"" she said."
China allows no foreign interference in Hong Kong affairs: spokesperson,"BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China does not allow any foreign interference in Hong Kong affairs, a government spokesperson said Monday.
Hong Kong belongs to China, and its affairs are China's internal affairs, Yang Guang, spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said at a press conference in Beijing.
""This is our unshakable position,"" Yang stressed.
Some people in the West have made ""irresponsible"" comments and have played a ""disgraceful"" role during the recent protests and violent incidents in Hong Kong, Yang said.
These people follow an absurd and ridiculous logic that violent and illegal actions should be sympathized with, understood or even tolerated, while police actions to maintain public security and rule of law in Hong Kong should be criticized, blamed or called to account, he added.
Yang accused some Western politicians of frequently making irresponsible remarks during recent weeks, with intentions to mess up Hong Kong and contain China's development.
Their attempt will not succeed, he said."
Commentary: Drop the attempt on meddling in Hong Kong affairs,"BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of a series of violent incidents initiated by radical protestors in Hong Kong, some politicians in the United States and Britain did not miss the chance of meddling in China's internal affairs, using their usual front as the champion of freedom and democracy.
What those radical protestors did was a trail of escalating violence. They first stormed and damaged the Legislative Council Complex in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), surrounded the police headquarters, attacked police officers and illegally stored dangerous goods and a large number of offensive weapons, and then on Sunday evening besieged and stormed the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR, defacing the national emblem and painting insulting words on the wall.
They trampled on the rule of law in Hong Kong, openly challenged the authority of the central government and crossed the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
Their shocking acts not only harmed the interest and wellbeing of Hong Kong people but also hurt the feelings of all Chinese including 7 million Hong Kong compatriots.
It is the lawful duty of any government to denounce violence, crack down upon crimes and safeguard the rule of law, which should have given no cause for criticism.
Just as Hong Kong's society called for a curb on violence, and the government and police of the HKSAR took necessary and lawful measures to maintain the social order, some U.S. and British politicians took turns to ""comment"" on the situation.
Totally disregarding the facts, they ""urged"" the HKSAR government to respect freedom of speech and assembly and even ""warned"" the HKSAR government not to use the damages caused by the protests as what they called ""an excuse for suppression.""
One can not help but wonder if Capitol Hill or the Palace of Westminster were besieged and ransacked, would the two governments just sit by, would the rights of democracy and freedom be exercised with violence and would the overt challenge to the Constitution and trampling on the law be allowed.
It seems that some politicians of the two longstanding Western powers have an ingrained habit of applying double standards.
The HKSAR is a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China, and its affairs are outright internal affairs of China.
The government and the people of China will not allow any foreign government, organization or individual to interfere in Hong Kong affairs.
Some politicians of the United States and Britain had better get rid of their double standards, stop sending the wrong messages regarding the violent and unlawful acts, end smearing of the ""one country, two systems"" principle and keep their hands off Hong Kong."
Moldovan parliament president opposes outside interference in Hong Kong affairs,"CHISINAU, Aug. 29 (Xinhua) -- The problem with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China remains the internal affairs of the country, and must be handled without any outside involvement, President of the Moldovan Parliament Zinaida Greceanii told Xinhua on Thursday in an interview.
""China is an independent state, and what happened in Hong Kong is its internal affairs and the situations should be clarified without the involvement of others,"" she said, specifying that ""we respect the freedom of citizens to protest, but the protests should be only peaceful, should not be violent, and should not be against official forces.""
According to Greceanii, every country must have the capacity to restore public order in its own state. ""I am definitely against any other state to involve, to give directions to other state how it should be and how it should proceed.""
""Every country has its own traditions, its own experience and has its own internal laws that must be respected by all citizens living in the territory of the state,"" she added, stressing that ""we also don't like others to interfere in the internal affairs of Moldova.""
She pointed out that the press, as well as the politicians, should not have a double standard. Every country must know how to defend the public order according to its procedures and laws, without any interference from the outside."
HKSAR gov't reiterates foreign legislatures should not interfere in internal affairs of HKSAR,"HONG KONG, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) -- In response to a report issued by the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, the government of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) reiterated late on Thursday that foreign legislatures should not interfere in any form in the internal affairs of the HKSAR.
Since its return to the motherland, Hong Kong has been exercising ""Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong"" and a high degree of autonomy in strict accordance with the HKSAR Basic Law, said a spokesman of the HKSAR government. ""The 'one country, two systems' principle has been fully and successfully implemented. The HKSAR government will continue to implement the 'one country, two systems' principle resolutely in accordance with the Basic Law.""
On human rights and freedoms, the spokesman stressed that safeguarding human rights and freedoms is a constitutional duty of the HKSAR government, as Article 4 of the Basic Law stipulates that the HKSAR shall safeguard the rights and freedoms of the residents of the HKSAR and of other persons in the region in accordance with law.
""Human rights and freedoms in Hong Kong are fully protected by the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and other legislation, in addition to the Basic Law. The HKSAR government attaches great importance to human rights and freedoms and is determined to safeguard them,"" the spokesman said.
""At the same time, the HKSAR government has a duty to implement and uphold the Basic Law and to ensure that all elections will be conducted in accordance with the Basic Law and relevant electoral laws. There is no political screening,"" he added.
Referring to the Basic Law which clearly stipulates that the HKSAR is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China (PRC), the spokesman pointed out that any suggestion for ""Hong Kong's independence"" is a blatant violation of the Basic Law and a direct affront to the national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity of the PRC.
""'Hong Kong's independence' runs counter to the successful implementation of 'one country, two systems' and undermines the HKSAR's constitutional and legal foundations as enshrined in the Basic Law. Relevant international human rights convention and court cases have clearly pointed out that freedom of speech is not absolute,"" he said.
On the rule of law in Hong Kong, the spokesman said the HKSAR government is committed to safeguarding the rule of law and judicial independence in Hong Kong, and there is no question of ""political prosecutions"" as alleged by the U.S. report.
""Article 63 of the Basic Law entrenches the constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence. The conduct of all criminal prosecutions of the Department of Justice (DoJ) is free from any interference. Decisions to prosecute or not, as the case may be, must be based on an objective and professional assessment of the available evidence and the law, and be in accordance with the published Prosecution Code. No political consideration is being taken into account at all,"" he said.
In respect of the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 (the Bill), the spokesman said HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced on June 15 that the Bill was suspended and later made it clear that all the legislative work had come to a complete halt. The chief executive further announced on Sept. 4 that the HKSAR government would formally withdraw the Bill and the secretary for security withdrew the Bill at the Legislative Council meeting on Oct. 23.
""In the past few months, there were a series of protests and public order events in Hong Kong. Some of them eventually became violent and illegal incidents, causing damage to district and community facilities as well as injury to members of the public. In response, the police have been exercising restraint and have been carrying out enforcement actions in strict accordance with the law,"" he said, stressing that the purpose of police's enforcement actions is to protect the life and property of the general public, bring offenders to justice and restore public order as soon as possible.
The Independent Police Complaints Council is conducting a fact-finding study on the handling of large-scale public order events since June, including corresponding actions by the police, to ascertain the facts and will prepare a report. The content of the report will be made public.
The HKSAR government has also launched a diversified dialogue platform and will invite community leaders, experts and academics to conduct an in-depth and independent examination of the social conflicts in Hong Kong and the deep-seated problems that must be addressed.
Concerning constitutional development, the spokesman said to achieve the ultimate aim of universal suffrage enshrined in the Basic Law, the community needs to engage in dialogues, premised on the legal basis and under a peaceful atmosphere with mutual trust, with a view to narrowing differences and attaining a consensus agreeable to all sides.
""The HKSAR government will assess the situation carefully and take forward constitutional development in accordance with the Basic Law and the relevant Interpretation and Decisions of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.""
Regarding strategic trade control, the spokesman said that Hong Kong, as a separate customs territory under the Basic Law, has been implementing comprehensive control on import, export and re-export of strategic commodities in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong and international control lists, carrying out rigorous enforcement, and maintaining close cooperation with the United States and other trading partners.
""Over the years, we have been closely collaborating with the U.S. administration and achieved satisfactory results in preventing illegal diversion of strategic commodities. Our efforts in this regard are recognized by the relevant authorities. We regret deeply that despite our repeated explanation, the report has still erroneously cited a totally irrelevant case to cast doubt on Hong Kong's strategic trade control system,"" he said."
1st LD Writethru: 21 officers injured in weekend violent incidents: Hong Kong police,"HONG KONG, Aug. 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police said on Monday that 21 officers were injured during the violent incidents over the weekend as radical protesters intensified violence, vandalizing shops randomly and assaulting police officers with deadly weapons.
Among the 21 officers, 16 were injured on Sunday, with one suffering massive bleeding after poled by a sharpened item in his back and five others were injured on Saturday after hit by bricks, according to a press briefing of the police.
Mak Chin-ho, assistant commissioner of police, said protesters used deadly weapons, including bricks, metal poles, long sticks and petrol bombs, to assault police officers.
""These attacks are intentional, planned and organized,"" he said.
""Through the whole of afternoon on Sunday, a large gang of rioters threw numerous self-made petrol bombs at police officers in Tsuen Wan,"" Mak said. ""In certain incidents, they randomly threw petrol bombs from height at people on protest sites, hitting innocent passersby.""
Besides assaulting police officers, radicals also obstructed roads and vandalized shops and tunnel facilities.
""Their destructive acts are rampant and reckless. They are not to be tolerated by any civil society,"" Mak said.
Elaborating on police officers forced to draw guns and one firing a warning shot to the sky, Mak said the officers were attacked and chased down by over 100 violent protesters armed with offensive weapons, a situation where their lives were in great danger.
""One officer fired a warning shot into the air. No one was hit,"" Mak said. ""I must emphasize the officers demonstrated great restraint. Their use of force was indeed necessary and reasonable. It was to protect any person, including our officers themselves from death or serious bodily injury.""
During the violent incidents on Sunday, 45 men and nine women, aged 12 to 51, were arrested for offenses including unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapon and assaulting police officers. The number of the arrested protesters totaled 86 during the whole weekend.
Mak reiterated zero-tolerance to violence and said the police will continue to stand firm and carry out their duties faithfully, diligently and impartially. He appealed to residents not to remain silent and not to tolerate such radical acts but raise their voice against violence and cut ties with all rioters.
The police also arrested and prosecuted another suspect involved in assaulting a reporter from the Chinese mainland on Aug. 13 at Hong Kong International Airport. The man, charged of unlawful assembly, wounding, possession of offensive weapon and unlawful imprisonment, was on court Monday."
Roundup: Int'l community slams U.S. passage of Hong Kong-related bill,"BEIJING, Oct. 17 (Xinhua) -- The passage of a Hong Kong-related bill by the U.S. Congress, which was a pure interference in China's internal affairs, unveiled the political intentions of those in the U.S. government to weaken China, the international community has said.
The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 -- moving it a step closer to becoming a law -- which would mandate an annual review to assess whether the Chinese city has sufficient autonomy.
The U.S. government is giving ""false signals of assurance and support"" to violent protesters in China's Hong Kong, Sourabh Gupta, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Institute for China-America Studies, told Xinhua in a written interview.
""With regard to the U.S. role, it has been deeply unhelpful,"" Gupta said.
""The real problem has been the U.S. veiled intentions: to first stir the pot, and thereafter to fan the flames of protest by providing oxygen to the worst political and militant elements within the protest movement,"" he said.
William Jones, Washington bureau chief of U.S. publication Executive Intelligence Review, called such a move of the U.S. Congress a pure ""interference in the affairs of China.""
""Many of the activists will be encouraged by this 'support', but if they continue with their destructive vandalism, I think opinion in Hong Kong will turn against them if it hasn't already,"" Jones said.
The U.S. bill is ""a very prejudicial bill against China and the authorities in Hong Kong,"" Richard Becker, west coast coordinator of the U.S.-based civil rights group Act Now to Stop War and End Racism, said recently at a conference titled ""The U.S. Role in Hong Kong: Behind the Headlines"" in San Francisco, U.S. state of California.
""This bill is not based on the objective situation. It's based on the political will of those in Congress and in the White House,"" Becker said.
""The so-called 'democracy movement' in Hong Kong must be seen in this light as an integral part of a strategy to weaken, and even to break up China,"" he said.
Eduardo Regalado, a researcher at Cuba's Center for International Policy, said that the bill is ""a pure interference and disrespect for the international law and relations.""
""The United States has double standards on human rights and criticizes only what is convenient for it,"" Regalado said, adding that the bill reflects U.S. intention to restrain China's development.
Ahmed Gusau Bala, former consul general of Nigeria to Hong Kong, recalled having a ""memorable experience"" in the Chinese city during his tour of duty there.
Noting that the Hong Kong people often go about their businesses peacefully, Bala said he was shocked to know that the ""beautiful place"" where he enjoyed working and lived happily was plunged into an ""unfortunate situation"" shortly after he ended his duty.
Every nation, including China, deserves to guard its own sovereignty, he said, emphasizing that China has all it takes to end the ongoing violence in Hong Kong.
""If some foreign governments or media are taking sides, then I think it is rather unfortunate,"" as foreign interference in the matter might slow down the peace process, he added."
Spotlight: HK actress known for negative roles plays real heroine in face of mobs,"HONG KONG, Oct. 18 (Xinhua) -- Even with 11 stitches on her head, Celine Ma still feels no regret.
The well-known Hong Kong actress was beaten up by masked mobs about two weeks ago after speaking out against the rioters' acts of vandalism. Ma, famous for her vivid performance of hated characters, acted as a valiant heroine saying no to violence in reality.
""I'm just an ordinary resident who loves Hong Kong and listens to my conscience,"" Ma told Xinhua in an exclusive interview on Wednesday.
""Looking back, I am still scared and my family and friends are worried about me. But I don't regret it. If I had a second chance, I would do the same!"" she said.
As the unrest in Hong Kong entered the fifth month, rioters who glorified themselves as ""freedom and democracy fighters"" brutally assaulted people who hold different opinions with them, either in streets, on trains or at shopping malls, the exact opposite of what they claimed to pursue.
Ma, over 50, stood out against their ferocity in the evening of Oct. 6.
She was about to go home by minibus after shopping in Mong Kok. However, a large group of black-clad protesters wearing face masks were setting up roadblocks, so she decided to take the subway. On her way to the metro station, Ma saw three masked rioters trashing the ATMs of an outlet of Bank of China.
Taking photos of what they were doing may have a ""deterrent"" effect on their actions, Ma thought. ""If they got scared, they would probably walk away."" So Ma started to film the vandalism with her phone.
The rioters were indeed scared. But instead of stopping or leaving, they dashed to her and snatched her phone. Ma chased them for about 100 meters to get her phone back, only to find that it was crushed on the ground.
Then she was outnumbered and surrounded. One rioter sprayed her in the face with unknown liquid; one kicked her down to the ground; one hit her with an umbrella; one wearing special gloves punched her in the chin. More and more masked rioters gathered around her, shouting obscenities at her.
Later at hospital, she had four stitches on her chin and seven on the back side of her head. The doctor said the wound in her chin was caused by knife-like object. ""I recalled that the man in black who punched me in the chin wore gloves, but I still have no idea what were in those gloves.""
Ma was spared from more serious injuries thanks to Robert Ovadia, a journalist and news anchor working for 7News Australia, who stepped in between her and the attackers and escorted her to a nearby police station, all the way through crowds of rioters.
Ovadia criticized the acts of the masked rioters days later on Facebook.
""She had no less right to protest than they (masked rioters) did, but because of it a solitary woman surrounded by an angry mob (championing 'freedom' and 'democracy') was sprayed in the face, punched, shoved to the ground and had a glass bottle smashed over her head,"" Ovadia said. ""I have seen other instances - more brutal - of people speaking out and getting assaulted.""
The journalist was shocked by the distortion of facts by some local media outlets, even naming and shaming Apple Daily, a popular local tabloid specialized in cooking up fake news and rumors, in particular against the government and police.
""Organizations like Apple Daily, which has specific links to the 'pro-democracy' protesters, deliberately edit videos out of context to alter their audience's impression of what happened, to make it seem like she attacked protesters first,"" Ovadia said. ""Apple Daily starts its sequence with Ms Ma defending herself, making her look like the aggressor and that became the narrative for so many.""
""I have never seen disinformation weaponized with such venom as my time in Hong Kong,"" Ovadia said.
But Ovadia did not expect what would follow after he spoke out the truth.
The journalist fell victim to doxxing, a torrent of abuse online and death threats, just like many other Hong Kong residents who did not agree with the use of violence by rioters. ""My name and picture were circulated among protesters and intelligence sources informed us we were to be targeted by these 'peaceful protesters.'""
Ovadia said he received a flood of communication from people thanking him for unbiased coverage, but only doing so in private messages. ""They say, because they don't want to fall victim to the angry mob either.""
""One has to wonder what sort of democracy they (mobs) are trying to preserve,"" he said.
""I've got him (Ovadia) in trouble,"" Ma said apologetically.
""In this case, what some Hong Kong media did is really disappointing. I hope they will stop making unfair reports and hurting people,"" Ma said.
Talking about the continued violence in Hong Kong, Ma said she was saddened and called on those young rioters to stop and look back at what they had done. ""Hong Kong's future is your future, and how can you have the heart to destroy your own future?""
Ma said the young people were deceived and instigated and teachers and parents should shoulder the responsibility to convey right views to them and let them know that violence could only make things worse, not better.
During the past months, Ma has repeatedly expressed her support for Hong Kong police, who, as the defender of peace and justice, suffered from unreasonable accusations and faced huge pressures. ""Under the circumstance, we especially need to support them and let them know Hong Kong residents are with them,"" she said.
Later this month, Ma will start to play a senior inspector of police in a TV series. Ma said she was excited for the opportunity and hoped her performance could show more tolerance and understanding on the part of the police.
As an actress, Ma has been to the mainland for multiple times and advised Hong Kong youngsters to learn more about their home country.
""There are many beautiful cities in the mainland that have developed transportation and advanced technology. There have been drastic changes from the past,"" Ma said.
""Hong Kong young people should know the history and culture of China and the country's hard-won development. They should be proud of being Chinese. We are all Chinese, with the same blood, which cannot be erased,"" Ma said."
Women representative condemns violent unlawful acts in Hong Kong at UN session,"GENEVA, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Pansy Ho Chiu-king, chairperson of the Hong Kong Federation of Women, on Wednesday condemned the ""increasingly escalating violent acts"" in the Chinese city.
In an oral statement delivered at the ongoing 42nd session of the UN Human Rights Council here in Geneva, Ho said that since June 6, HK people have been plagued with over 130 protests in which 110 ended in unprovoked violence and unlawful acts, driving hundreds of small businesses to close down and many workers jobless.
""We condemn the increasingly escalating violent acts of HK's radical protestors,"" she noted.
The HK NGO representative told the Council that ordinary HK citizens are the hardest hit victims.
""An alarming rate of young children are running away from home to become frontline riot fighters in full gear and weaponry, radicalized to perpetrate criminal acts,"" she said, adding that children of all age are indoctrinated with police-hatred at school and online, and mobilized to conduct massive school strikes.
She added that those who reject to follow, especially police's children, will be maliciously harassed, intimidated and bullied both physically and on the internet.
""We will not tolerate child exploitation and we call for the international community to reprimand those organizers and influencers,"" she said, adding that promoting hatred and violent extremism could only leave irreparable scars to forever stripe our beloved city of harmony and stability."
Across China: Moving with grace: Spanish art Flamenco fascinates more Chinese,"SHANGHAI, Aug. 3 (Xinhua) -- ""In Flamenco songs, there's a line that goes: 'I fell into a deep well without a rope,' which is exactly what I feel now,"" said 42-year-old Tao Jiarong, a Shanghai-based white-collar worker who indulges in the fascinating Spanish art.
Flamenco, a folk art originated in Spain, combines singing, dancing and guitar playing with varied rhythms and rich emotional expressions and is considered as the quintessence of Spain along with the bullfighting.
Dating back to around the 15th century, the art is generally believed to be an artistic product of Gypsies' uprooted lives of grief, protests, hopes and catharsis.
Flamenco has long been synonymous with the famous opera ""Carmen"" in China, but for Tao, ""the deep well"" is more like an inexhaustible treasure, to which now she has devoted almost all her spare time.
""Currently, Shanghai has around 400 Flamenco trainees a year, a very small number compared to the city's total population of more than 24 million,"" Tao said. But the number is on the rise in recent years.
In a neighborhood near Zhongshan Park in Shanghai, Tao comes to the Flamenco dance studio founded by her friend Shi Yiqi every week. More than 20 participants from nearby communities receive introductory training in the studio, where professional foreign dancers help them learn more about the comprehensive art form.
Learning Flamenco is different from learning ballroom dancing, as the latter requires more cooperation and coordination of the dancers while the former enchants the participants with its abundant cultural connotation.
As China has more and more Flamenco lovers, an increasing number of Flamenco studios and workshops have sprung up. Such studios and workshops used to be available only in big cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Taipei, but now they are almost everywhere in cities including Nanjing, Xi'an, Changsha, Chengdu and Chongqing, according to Shi.
""Flamenco itself is the synthesis of art,"" Tao said.
Tao still recalls the first time she learned about Flamenco in 2008 during a Flamenco performance of the Spanish national ballet in Shanghai. She was so struck by the grace and passion of the dancers in red dresses that she immediately signed up for a Flamenco training course.
When Tao saw the impromptu Flamenco performances by Spanish dancing masters in the Spanish pavilion at the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, she had a better understanding of the art form.
About three years ago, Tao decided to change from a dancer to a Flamenco singer. While learning to sing the Flamenco songs, she realized that the exotic art is like a cultural treasure box.
""Flamenco's philosophy is about fusion and acceptance, a kind of attitude. In the eyes of many audiences, the dances and performances express extreme emotions, but ultimately, Flamenco achieves the result of self-reconciliation. I also reach reconciliation with my heart and the world when dancing,"" said Tao.
Now, in addition to learning to sing with Spanish singers via the Internet, Tao also spends her holidays in Andalusia, Spain, immersing herself in various singing styles with local features, taking part in training and performances.
""Shanghai now hosts several music festivals in summer with Flamenco performances, which has provided the public with more channels to learn about the art. More and more are willing to pay their way to learn the art in Spain,"" Shi said, adding that her studio alone has more than 80 trainees now.
In music, the dancers with flower earrings flick and flutter like butterflies in their long tail dresses, bridging the differences in cultural backgrounds of China and Spain with their shared love of the arts.
Tao is happy that Flamenco is gaining its popularity among the Chinese, but the country still lacks experienced musicians and singers. Tao and Shi hope to develop more Chinese musicians and backup singers for the art in the near future.
In 2018, they formed Shanghai's first homegrown Flamenco band, which now plays regularly in the municipality.
""The art makes me feel alive. I have a hunch that I'll continue to love it in the future,"" Shi said."
Hong Kong police arrest 748 violent protesters since June 9,"HONG KONG, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong police said on Thursday that they have arrested 748 people during a series of violent protests since June 9.
Kong Wing-cheung, senior superintendent of police public relations branch, told a press briefing that among the arrested, 115 people have been charged with various offensives.
According to Kong, 17 people were detained on Wednesday night when protesters besieged and attacked police stations in Sham Shui Po and Tin Shui Wai.
The people, 15 male and two female aged between 15 and 61, were arrested for unlawful assembly, illegal discharge of firecrackers and fireworks, desecrating national flags, possession of offensive weapons, criminal damage and attempted arson, Kong said.
Among the 115 charged, two men, aged 27 and 28 respectively, were accused of obstructing police from entering the Hong Kong airport to rescue two besieged residents from the mainland, he added.
During the operations, 177 police personnel have sustained injuries, including 11 policewomen, since June 9."
14 accused of violating mask ban in Hong Kong,"HONG KONG, Oct. 8 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen people were on Tuesday accused of wearing face masks in protests, the second group of violators under arrest after the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) enacted the anti-mask law in an effort to curb escalating violence.
The West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts held the trial against those suspects, who, along with 12 other people, were also charged of participating in riot near Hennessy Road, Wan Chai on Sunday.
The HKSAR government on Friday invoked the power under the Emergency Regulations Ordinance and put in place the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation as a deterrent to rioters, most of whom have used masks to conceal their identities. Two people were indicted for violating the new law on Monday.
A male biting off a police officer's finger during a violent protest in Sha Tin on July 14 appeared in court again on Tuesday. He faced four charges including assaulting police and wounding, after adjustment by the prosecutor."
Ongoing violence could strike irreparable blow to Hong Kong economy: expert,"BAKU, Aug. 27 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing violence in Hong Kong could deal an irreparable blow to the city's economic performance, an Azerbaijani expert warned on Tuesday.
Political analyst Ilgar Velizade told Xinhua the Chinese port city has long benefited from the ""one country, two systems"" principle, and continuously functions as a gateway for overseas investors and exporters to China.
This role has put Hong Kong at the top of economy and finance ratings for years, Velizade said, warning that this achievement could be ruined by the ongoing turmoil.
Destructive acts by rioters, the ongoing protests, and the threat of chaos, unrest and illegal activities that have almost paralyzed the city could trigger an outflow of investment, even an economic recession, which will profoundly impact the lives of ordinary people, the expert said.
He said that China's numerous friends around the world, including those in Azerbaijan, hope for the restoration of peace and stability as soon as possible in Hong Kong."
"Western media need to be objective over situation in Hong Kong, says expert","NEW DELHI, Aug. 26 (Xinhua) -- Western media need to be objective over the situation in Hong Kong and report ""what exactly is going on,"" said B.R. Deepak, a professor at India's Jawaharlal Nehru University.
Western media ""are silent about Hong Kong demonstrators inflicting injuries on police officers,"" said Deepak, noting that their reports only showed demonstrators being attacked, while avoiding mentioning that the demonstrators were engaging in violence themselves.
""It is biased in some sense,"" he said.
Violent demonstrations are ""disturbing,"" as Hong Kong is one of the most vibrant and independent financial centers in the world, Deepak said. ""It is essentially bad for Hong Kong, for China and maybe for the Asia Pacific region.""
He called for an end to these protests in order to ""restore peace, law and order in society."""
"Violence in HK undermines peace, harmony: Hong Konger living in Australia","CANBERRA, Aug. 28 (Xinhua) -- The recent violence in Hong Kong has been undermining peace and harmony, and hammering economy there, said Sam Wong who is from Hong Kong and has lived in Australia for half a century.
""My heart is sinking as a Hong Kong person living in Australia,"" said Wong, chair of Canberra Multicultural Community Forum Inc. ""I think this is an absolute tragedy for the people of Hong Kong.""
Wong, who had lived in Hong Kong for nearly 20 years before moving to Australia, told Xinhua that from his relative in Hong Kong, he has learned about what happened there.
Things deteriorated in Hong Kong with protesters becoming more and more violent, he said, adding ""I think they become urban terrorists, with escalating violence.""
""They destroyed peace and harmony in Hong Kong.""
In this process, he said some Western media played a very bad role.
""The Western press in general ... rarely have any good news about China,"" he said. ""In the case of Hong Kong, I think the Western media have been very selective. They always favor the protesters, the rioters.""
Meanwhile, ""for the most tolerant Hong Kong police, they have been demonized, or damned as black police,"" Wong said.
""Until recent time, only a day or so ago, the police fired the first shot into air to scare the rioters because they were really in danger of their lives. And there are policemen in the hospital because of the rock attack through rioters. Interestingly, the press said the rioters were deliberately attacked by the police. And that's been on for quite some time.""
Speaking in English and sometime in Cantonese, Wong said the biased reports showed the double standard of certain Western countries.
Wong said people's freedom in Hong Kong has significantly improved compared with the time before the year of 1997 when Hong Kong returned to the motherland.
""I was brought up there in the 50s and 60s,"" he recalled. ""Under the British colonial rules, if you had a slight disagreement ... or you are trying to protest anything, you would be arrested quickly.""
Wong said the recent riot would deal a blow to Hong Kong's economy. ""You can see people are not coming to Hong Kong by airport because there was violence, and many shops are shutting down,"" he said. ""There will be huge unemployment because people are not going out and buying things.""
What's more, rioters vandalized infrastructure like lamp poles and traffic lights. ""They even damaged shops,"" he said. ""Hong Kong will recover, but it may take some time. For now, it is too bad."""
"China refutes U.S., U.K. remarks on Hong Kong violence","BEIJING, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- China on Tuesday refuted remarks by U.S. and British officials regarding the latest riot in Hong Kong, calling the remarks a reflection of hypocrisy and double standards.
It was reported that an unnamed senior U.S. official said Monday the U.S. condemned ""unjustified use of deadly force"" in Hong Kong violence, claiming the police and civilians alike ""have a responsibility to de-escalate and avoid violent confrontations.""
The statement was made after a Hong Kong police officer shot a protester who attempted to snatch his gun.
U.K. Prime Minister's Downing Street Office earlier also urged all sides to be calm and exercise restraint, adding that the prime minister supported ""the right to peaceful protests.""
""If you watch the video clip, you will see clearly that the rioters assaulted the police first and the officer's response was fully lawful,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said.
Geng told a press briefing that grabbing police firearms, assaulting or threatening officers on duty were absolutely forbidden in any country and would be dealt with strong police force.
""I want to ask the U.S. and British officials: How would their police deal with similar situations in their countries?"" Geng said.
Speaking about a civilian who was set on fire by rioters for publicly expressing his objections to vandalism by the rioters, Geng said the remarks from Washington and London exposed their hypocrisy and double standards.
""If they truly oppose violence and call for restraint, like what they said, then why didn't they strongly condemn such attack on ordinary civilians?""
Geng called attention to the fact that the U.S. government official refused to reveal his name. ""I'm afraid they felt embarrassed themselves in making such remarks.""
""Ending violence and restoring order is the paramount task in Hong Kong,"" Geng said, urging the U.S. and the U.K. to respect China's sovereignty and exercise prudence on Hong Kong-related issues and stop meddling in China's internal affairs."
"Commentary: The truth behind rioters who call themselves ""the valiant"" in Hong Kong","HONG KONG, Aug. 30 (Xinhua) -- Though they call themselves ""the valiant"" without any ""backstage support,"" plans or organization, the truth behind the rioters remains difficult to conceal.
Radical protesters have repeatedly committed violence and instigated hatred against Hong Kong police. The latest media reports provide more proof of meticulous planning, extremist views, and their salient goal to cause further chaos, fear and antagonism in Hong Kong.
A video released by the New York Times disclosed a secret warehouse and hideout for radical protesters, who have been causing tremendous mayhem in Hong Kong for the third straight month.
The video showed a group of young people gathering in a hotel, part of an underground network of safe houses. They said protests were like playing Grand Theft Auto video games and were ""fun,"" and they looked forward to the police taking action.
In the clip, a masked female protester said, ""The next person to die could be one of us. ... Everyone has to shoulder the responsibility.""
The clip also showed protesters included a group of students under the age of 18, whose parents did not know they were involved. ""Some tell us they would die for this movement,"" a journalist narrated in the video.
One protester talked about buying masks and glasses, but in fact, the protesters have used far more offensive weapons including sling shots, laser beams and petrol bombs to attack police and innocent civilians.
Sources said 500 to 1,000 radical protesters possess a strong tendency for violence, while some are advocating more violent acts in the future, including plans to sabotage power stations in Hong Kong.
Radical protesters are relying heavily on anonymous messaging apps like Telegram for orchestrating and coordinating attacks against the police, a tactic that has been used by terrorists to plot and carry out terror attacks in other parts of the world in recent years.
Those protesters share manuals on how to make petrol bombs and how to frame the anti-rioting law enforcement by police on online forums and social media.
The ""manual on fighting,"" which has been widely circulated among rioters, elaborates ""pre-war preparations,"" ""personal training,"" ""battleground response"" and ""information about arrests,"" with details on protective gear, weak points of the police and countermeasures, and how to respond before and after arrests.
""Being the valiant is a meaningful make-or-break gamble for us,"" said the manual.
Over the past two months, nearly 900 people involved in violent incidents have been arrested.
On multiple occasions, radical protestors took down roadside railings to form barricades long before police arrived. A large number of deadly petrol bombs have been used.
Lately, HKlastword has been trending on Twitter and it is full of agitating messages and hate speech against police officers. One reads: ""If we burn, you burn with us.""
Local online forums like lihkg.com and hkgolden.com are also full of calls for more violence this week.
One post on lihkg.com reads: ""Laam-Tsao (die together) will prevail!"", referring to a Cantonese slogan rioters are widely using to mobilize suicide bomber-style sentiment online and street violence in Hong Kong.
Another post on the website even taught rioters violent tactics for besieging police stations: ""We should use more locks on the steel gates of police stations to prevent them from getting out. When they try to unlock the gate, we can kill them with whatever we find.""
""When confronting the police, we should intensively attack their feet to prevent them from chasing us,"" it added.
Such instigative posts remained unchecked on social media day after day, while other radicals advocated the bullying of police officers' children in schools.
Alvin Tai Kin-fai, assistant principal of the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union Logos Academy, wrote on his Facebook page that he hopes children of the policemen who ""used violence"" will die before they turn 7 years old, or die before 20 if they are already older than 7.
Escalating violence has become a paramount issue and actions should be taken to stop them, members of the Hong Kong public have said.
In a statement published in local media this month, Peter Woo, senior counsel of The Wharf (Holdings) Limited, appealed to protesters to stop violence, citing the definition of terrorism in the Oxford Dictionary's online version -- ""the unlawful act of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims."""
China slashes British foreign secretary's Hong Kong comments,"BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- China on Wednesday expressed strong dissatisfaction with and firm opposition to the recent comments on Hong Kong made by British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, urging him to stop wanton interference in Hong Kong affairs.
""He seems to be fantasizing in the faded glory of British colonialism and obsessed with the bad habit of criticizing and lecturing on other countries' affairs condescendingly,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said at a daily press briefing.
Geng said China has lodged stern representations with Britain over Hunt's comments.
According to The Times, Hunt said on Tuesday that he expected China to honor the Sino-British Joint Declaration, a treaty signed in 1984 when Margaret Thatcher was the prime minister, and that ""there will be serious consequences if that internationally binding legal agreement were not to be honored.""
Geng said as Hong Kong returned to the motherland, the rights and obligations of the British side under the Joint Declaration were completely fulfilled.
On July 1, 1997, China resumed sovereignty over Hong Kong and the Chinese government started administering it in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law, said Geng.
""The British side has no sovereignty over Hong Kong, nor does it have administrative power or supervisory power since its return. It has no so-called responsibility for Hong Kong at all,"" said Geng, calling it ""sheer delusion with mawkish sentimentality"" for the British side to ""consider itself as a guardian.""
""It is just shameless to say that the freedom of Hong Kong residents is negotiated for them by the British side,"" Geng said.
Geng said he wanted to remind Hunt that Hong Kong had no democracy at all during the British colonial rule, and the Hong Kong people had not even the rights to take to the streets to protest.
It is the Chinese government that protects Hong Kong people's rights of democracy and freedom in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law and fully implements the principles of ""one country, two systems,"" Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong and a high degree of autonomy, said Geng.
In response to Hunt's remarks that the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) should not use the storming of the region's Legislative Council (LegCo) Complex by demonstrators as a pretext to ""repress"" its people, Geng said Hunt was calling black white by saying so as the storming of the LegCo Complex on July 1 was severe violation of law, Geng said.
Stressing that Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs that brook no foreign interference, Geng said China advises Britain, especially Hunt, to stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs as it is doomed to fail."
"Spotlight: Rumors on smart lampposts easily refuted, but damages far-reaching","HONG KONG, Aug. 27 (Xinhua) -- Despite the habitual silence of some West and Hong Kong media on how rioters have wreaked havoc on Hong Kong's traffic safety system, Hong Kong residents have long been indignant at the systematic smashing of traffic light control boxes and cutting of the power lines of traffic lights.
Vandalism escalated during the last weekend when a flock of rioters tore down a multifunctional smart lamppost and damaged about 20 others.
After watching the barbaric scenes of masked man cutting through the lampposts with chain saws, one could not help wondering how the worsening vandalism and distortion of facts would advance their ""peaceful"" protests.
 RUMORS EASILY REFUTED
The smashing of the smart lampposts in Kowloon Bay came despite repeated reassurance from the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) that the lampposts, which play crucial roles in building Hong Kong into a smart city, are not monitoring devices.
Those saboteurs and their enablers claimed that the smart lampposts collect information from passers-by and infringe on residents' privacy.
In fact, smart lampposts only collect city data, including traffic, meteorological and air quality data, to facilitate smart city development.
Even the government has no access to the raw data collected. According to Secretary for Innovation & Technology Nicholas Yang, an edge computer in the lamppost takes only one second to analyze the raw data before the data is deleted immediately.
""So basically, what remains is the analyzed data by the edge computer and that data by definition is open data. It's accessible. It's presentable to every citizen to share,"" said Yang.
In addition, according to the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO), the smart lampposts do not carry any facial recognition function claimed by the rioters, and cannot detect or read information of identity cards.
In fact, to promote transparency, the OGCIO in July released a list of the locations, functions and equipment of the 50 smart lampposts that have already been installed.
It also pledged to release information concerning any future installation of smart lampposts with the same level of transparency.
Unfortunately, the transparency was taken advantage of by the radical protesters to locate the smart lampposts.
To justify their groundless accusation, the violent protesters circulated the picture of a device ""BLE Locator Model: SPLD01"" found inside the smart lamppost that was torn down.
In fact, the device in question is a Bluetooth beacon for offering positioning service to the public and visitors, which is believed to be more precise than Global Positioning System (GPS).
The device is designed by a local small enterprise called Logistics and Supply Chain MultiTech R&D Center, whose ""shareholders/directors ... and all its employees are local citizens born and brought up in Hong Kong,"" according to a statement by the HKSAR government.
FAR-REACHING DAMAGES
During the weeks-long unrest and violence, the radical protesters and those forces behind them have been relentless in distorting information in their favor.
After the mutilation of the lampposts delivered no evidence of the imaginary ""facial recognition software,"" rumors were still swirling among protesters and online that those lampposts were so-called ""facial recognition towers.""
According to the local daily Ta Kung Pao, when the Hong Kong Legislative Council (LegCo) approved the funding for the Multi-functional Smart Lampposts pilot scheme in May 2018, opposition lawmaker Jeremy Tam, who was present at the scene of sabotage in Kowloon Bay on Saturday, voted in favor of the scheme.
In addition, six other opposition lawmakers abstained from voting, and another five opposition members were absent from voting, which virtually helped pass the funding.
Amid protracted unrest, the opposition lawmakers now portray themselves as resisting the program.
Responding to the damages to the smart lampposts and the ensuing disinformation, LegCo member Elizabeth Quat said that the opposition has ""lost its reason, misleading the public with ulterior motives.""
""They once again spread fear, keep hyping up the use of smart lampposts and ignore the development and future of Hong Kong,"" she said.
Apart from dissemination of misinformation about the installation of smart lampposts, the radical protesters have also subjected the Hong Kong taxpayers to a hefty bill.
According to the OGCIO, the cost for each smart lamppost is about 140,000 Hong Kong dollars (17,845 U.S. dollars). While the authorities are still checking the conditions of the lampposts, given the severe damages, the overall reparation fee could amount to 2.8 million Hong Kong dollars (356,911 U.S. dollars).
If the monetary burden is still manageable, the long-term impact on Hong Kong's innovation and technology industry is unfathomable.
Shortly after the destruction of smart lampposts by radical protesters, news came out that the local small company, which has so far supplied the Bluetooth beacons installed in the smart lampposts, decided to cease cooperation with the HKSAR government upon completion of its work on the existing 50 lampposts.
The contractor is facing ""threats to the personal safety of family members of directors and employees,"" said a statement by the Innovation and Technology Bureau.
""The incident is a serious blow to the hard work of the local innovation and technology industry,"" the statement concluded.
Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Secretary for Innovation & Technology Yang appealed for public support to technological advancement in Hong Kong.
""Hong Kong should be an open city (to innovation and technology),"" said Yang, adding that the HKSAR government will continue to seek public support in a ""highly transparent way.""
""It is our hope that Hong Kong will have a better future,"" he said."
1st LD Writethru: HKSAR gov't condemns violence as protesters hurl petrol bombs,"HONG KONG, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- The government of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in early morning of Monday condemned violent acts of protesters occurring on Sunday.
Some protesters on Sunday even hurled petrol bombs at police, causing injuries of a police officer.
In unlawful assemblies in various districts, violent protesters vandalized public property, blocked roads, besieged police stations, aimed laser beams toward police officer and also hurled bricks to attack them, a spokesperson of the HKSAR government said in a statement.
""We are outraged by the violent protesters' behaviors which showed a total disregard of the law, posing a serious threat to the safety of police officers and other members of the public,"" the spokesperson said. ""We severely condemn the acts.""
Due to the persistent and large-scale illegal and violent acts, some public facilities were closed early and emergency services and commercial activities were obstructed, the spokesperson said, stressing that the right of ordinary people to carry on their daily lives was deprived.
""We appeal to all members of the public to say no to violence to help the community to restore order as soon as possible,"" the spokesperson said. ""The police will enforce the law strictly and resolutely to bring illegal protesters to justice.""
Protests were held on Sunday in multiple locations in Hong Kong despite police ban.
Rioters attacked police stations in several places including Cheung Sha Wan, Tsim Sha Tsui and Wan Chai, hurling petrol bombs and aiming laser beams toward police personnel. A police officer in Tsim Sha Tsui was seriously burnt on duty.
While visiting the injured officer, Hong Kong's Commissioner of Police Lo Wai-chung condemned the illegal violent acts, saying he was saddened by his colleague's injury and indignant at the rioters' violent acts that ""disregarded others' safety.""
Lo also vowed to spare no effort to investigate and punish any violent acts that cause serious injuries or threaten the lives of others."
HKSAR gov't condemns violent acts of rioters for disrupting social order,"HONG KONG, Oct. 31 (Xinhua) -- The government of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) strongly condemned the violent acts of the rioters participating in unauthorized assemblies Thursday night, saying such ""illegal acts disrupted social order and jeopardized people's safety.""
""Rioters once again took the opportunity to block roads, seriously disrupting traffic. Some people hurled petrol bombs with no regard to the safety of others,"" said a spokesman for the HKSAR government.
In the evening, large groups of protesters flooded Mong Kok district and some damaged the exits of mass transit railway (MTR) and traffic lights. Around 9:30 p.m. local time, rioters escalated their violent protests, built barricades and set them ablaze.
In response to the drastically deteriorating situation, police officers ""used minimum necessary force, including tear gas, to effect dispersal,"" the Hong Kong police said in a statement.
At the junction of D'Aguilar Street and Stanley Street and the junction of D'Aguilar Street and Queen's Road Central in Central district, scores of protesters occupied the roads. The police later declared they were ""participating in an unauthorized assembly"" and asked them to leave immediately.
Meanwhile, in the vicinity of Lan Kwai Fong, the police have taken crowd control management measures since 7:30 p.m. local time to prevent the public from entering the extremely crowded area.
The spokesman also expressed deep regret that despite repeated clarifications that there were no cases involving death in Prince Edward MTR station on Aug. 31, some misled by online rumors still responded to calls for unauthorized assemblies, appealing to the public not to join such unlawful rallies.
""The police will strictly enforce the law and will not condone illegal acts,"" the spokesman warned."
"China lashes out at U.S. politicians for indulging, supporting anti-China disruptors in HK","BEIJING, Sept. 12 (Xinhua) -- It is because of the indulgence and support by some U.S. politicians that the anti-China disruptors in Hong Kong are so reckless and unscrupulous, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Wednesday, demanding them stop condoning violent criminal offenses and stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs immediately.
   Some U.S. lawmakers submitted a bill to the Congress on Tuesday, calling for a suspension of sales of law enforcement equipment by U.S. companies to Hong Kong because they claimed that the police in Hong Kong have been widely criticized for what they did to the protesters. The law enforcement equipment includes tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets.
   In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said: ""I wonder if the U.S. Congressmen want to save these anti-riot equipment to deal with problems at home?""
   Speaking at a daily news briefing, Hua said that with regard to what happened in Hong Kong recently, the facts are clear.
   More and more mainstream international media have reported the true situation in Hong Kong with on-site coverage. ""For example, I just saw many high-resolution photos released by some Russian media, depicting demonstrators' weapons like umbrellas with knives and barbs hidden inside and gasoline bombs,"" she said.
   The reports said that some were carrying out terrorist and criminal activities under the cover of freedom and democracy, and the root cause of Hong Kong's violence and chaos lies with the malicious forces behind the scene. The so-called press freedom in Hong Kong is nearing absurdity, according to the reports.
   ""I would like to ask those U.S. lawmakers, when the violent extremists in Hong Kong brutally assaulted and injured the police and brought public facilities like the airport and subway to a standstill, where is the rule of law that you claim to advocate? When personal information of more than 1,000 police officers and their families were illegally exposed and they were targeted by crazy cyber bullying and threats, where are the human rights that you claim to champion? When people holding different views were chased, surrounded and beaten by black-clad demonstrators wearing masks, where is the freedom you claim to stand for?"" she said.
   Hua pointed out that some U.S. lawmakers are beautifying the violent criminal offenses as fight for human rights and freedom. At the same time, they are defaming Hong Kong police by calling their forbearance and restraint ""overuse of force.""
   ""There is no worse insult to freedom, democracy and human rights than this. It is open disregard for the mainstream public opinion of ending violence and chaos and restoring order, and it exposes their stark hypocrisy and double standard,"" she said.
   ""How did the U.S. police handle demonstrations? I believe many have vivid memories of the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement, the 2015 unrest in Baltimore, Maryland, as well as the recent demonstrations in Portland, Oregon. If the scenes in Hong Kong were to appear in the U.S., would the U.S. lawmakers still be so 'kind'? We are curious to see,"" she said.
   ""It is because of the indulgence and support by some U.S. politicians that the anti-China disruptors in Hong Kong are so reckless and unscrupulous,"" Hua said.
   She said that at a recent press conference on the situation in Hong Kong, Spokesperson Yang Guang of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office quoted Man Jiang Hong (a classical Chinese poem) composed by Chairman Mao Zedong in 1963.
   ""Today I would like to add the following two lines: The ants climbing up a locust tree congratulate themselves for running a great empire, but it won't be easy for them to shake the tree,"" Hua said.
   ""I will reiterate that Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs. No foreign government, organization or individual has any right to interfere. Those playing with fire on this issue will end up getting burned themselves,"" she said.
   ""We advise certain people in the U.S. to stop pretending to be asleep, stop condoning violent criminal offenses, and stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs immediately,"" she added."
Moody's change of Hong Kong's outlook lacks factual basis: HK financial secretary,"HONG KONG, Sept. 16 (Xinhua) -- The change of Hong Kong's rating outlook by Moody's Investors Service lacks factual basis, Paul Chan Mo-po, the financial secretary of the government of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), said Monday.
The HKSAR government disagrees with Moody's in the change of the outlook. Moody's argument that recent social incidents may weaken Hong Kong's institutional competitive advantage ""lacks factual basis"", Chan said.
Moody's kept Hong Kong's Aa2 issuer rating but changed its outlook to negative from stable in a report issued earlier in the day.
Hong Kong's core competitiveness remains unaffected by recent social incidents. It remains a top global financial hub and one of the easiest places to do business in the world with free flow of capital, goods, information and talents, low taxes, sound regulation, rule of law, judicial independence and professional service of high quality, Chan said.
Even though recent protests have caught much attention, Hong Kong's financial market and banking system remain healthy without any significant capital outflow, he said.
Deepening economic cooperation with the mainland will keep driving Hong Kong's growth in the long run, especially its highly competitive service sector, Chan added.
Moody's also recognized Hong Kong's ""minimal debt burden and large fiscal reserves"" in its report, saying HKSAR has strong resilience to economic and financial shocks and the ability to address long-term structural challenges."
"Hong Kong's exports, imports of goods continue to fall in July","HONG KONG, Aug. 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's total exports and imports of goods both fell in July, as radical protests and violence continued to weigh on its economy since early June amid softening global economic growth, the latest trade data showed on Monday.
The value of total exports of goods dropped 5.7 percent over a year earlier to 338.6 billion HK dollars (about 43.16 billion U.S. dollars), after falling 9.0 percent year-on-year in June, according to the Census and Statistics Department of Hong Kong.
The value of total imports of goods declined 8.7 percent over a year earlier to 370.8 billion HK dollars (about 47.27 billion dollars) in July, after a year-on-year decline of 7.5 percent in June, resulting in a trade deficit of 32.2 billion HK dollars (about 4.1 billion dollars).
For the first seven months of 2019, the value of total exports of goods dropped by 3.9 percent year on year, while imports of goods weakened by 5.1 percent.
Trade deficit reached 276.8 billion HK dollars in the January-July period."

"Hong Kong residents voice support for police, national unity","HONG KONG, Sept. 14 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Hong Kong residents gathered at the Amoy Plaza in Kowloon on Saturday despite a heat wave, who sang China's national anthem to show their support to a teacher beaten by protesters for singing that song days ago.
The rally started at about 3:00 p.m. local time when the residents waved China's national flag and sang together, before chanting ""Police, keep it up!""
On the evening of Wednesday, a primary school teacher surnamed Lee walked into the Amoy Plaza with three kids. Disagreeing with the protesters, he sang the Chinese national anthem. The infuriated black-clad men punched him in the face, and his mobile phone was taken away.
In the Amoy Plaza on Saturday afternoon some residents held banners saying ""you will never sing alone.""
Yeung Man told Xinhua that her neighbor's kid was in Lee's class and she came voluntarily with nine others in the neighborhood to the rally.
""I would like to show my support to Lee, as well as the Hong Kong police,"" she said. ""I would also like to make our voices heard that we as Hong Kong residents want national unity and 'one country, two systems'.""
""Maybe I didn't have the courage like Lee in the past, but this time I decide to stand out,"" said a 38-year-old Mr. Tuan. ""Violence of the protesters have seriously affected our normal life, and we cannot continue keeping silent.""
During the gathering, protesters dressed in black and wearing face masks appeared outside the plaza. They shouted abusive words at the residents, who responded ""we don't have to wear masks.""
About five minutes later, police officers were called to the scene. Residents at the rally cheered while waving their national flags.
Some participants unfolded a banner that read ""no time to waste for us to protect Hong Kong; residents and police should join hands to work together.""
Ms. Chiu said that her daughter was among the protesters. ""I want to let them know, as a mother, that violence is bad.""
Ms. Yeung said that the protests, which have lasted for three months, tore apart the society. ""The protests sowed discord between friends, colleagues, classmates and even family members,"" she said. ""Some friends stopped speaking to each other, and colleagues poured vitriol to one another.""
She hoped that after the event, the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region could reflect on education. ""Many young people lack the knowledge of Chinese history and especially the Hong Kong history,"" she said. ""They know little about the Chinese mainland. So it is very easy for them to believe in rumors.""
Her view was shared by retiree Cheung Ming-wai. ""The negative information was exaggerated, so that many of the young people could hardly see the good side,"" she said.
She condemned the rioters for bringing chaos and fear to local residents. When violence finally erupted on Saturday afternoon around the Amoy Plaza, many stores on the street closed.
""They blocked traffic, forced subway to stop, and damaged infrastructure of our city,"" Cheung said. ""I am afraid. When they protested, we have to stay indoor. When will this come to an end?"""
Hong Kong's EAC calls for end of violence to hold peaceful election,"HONG KONG, Nov. 7 (Xinhua) -- The Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC) of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Thursday called for the stop of all threats and violence so as to hold the 2019 District Council Ordinary Election in a peaceful and orderly manner.
The election will be held on Nov. 24.
A spokesman for the EAC said that over 4.13 million registered electors can vote in the election, and their right for voting should not be interfered by violence or any improper conduct.
The election should be held in a peaceful, fair, open and safe manner, said the spokesman.
As the polling day is approaching, the EAC calls on all sectors of the society to exercise restraint, respect and be inclusive to people with different views.
The EAC is devoting all its efforts to prepare for the election and formulate contingency plans for possible incidents to ensure the election can be held in an open, fair and honest manner, said the spokesman, adding the smooth proceeding of election owes much to the full cooperation of all Hong Kong residents.
The spokesman stressed that it is the expectation of all the candidates and electors to have a smooth election. As such, different sectors of the community should respect each other, and should not sabotage the long-standing good election culture in Hong Kong or obstruct the election.
There have been concerns as continued protests, confrontations and violent incidents have occurred recently, especially during the weekends, with candidates of the election and public figures assaulted and offices of members of the Legislative Council and District Councils vandalized, the spokesman said, adding the situation is indeed worrying and the EAC does not want to see any threat or violence during the election.
Hong Kong is divided into 452 District Council Constituency Areas under 18 districts. The District Council has a function to advise the HKSAR government on district affairs. Each term of office for the District Council is four years."
"Interview: Hong Kong part of China, only China knows how to handle situation: Pakistani senator","by Misbah Saba Malik
ISLAMABAD, Aug. 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreign interference in Hong Kong violates the international law and diplomatic norms, because Hong Kong is China's internal matter, a Pakistani Senator has said.
""China knows how to handle the situation (in Hong Kong) ... We support China on the policy of Hong Kong,"" Mushahid Hussain Syed, chairman of the Pakistani Senate's standing committee on foreign affairs told Xinhua on Saturday.
Pakistan fully supports stability and prosperity of China's Hong Kong and believes that it should not be undermined by any unrest, he said, adding that his country rejects any external interference in Hong Kong as it is an issue of China's territorial integrity and sovereignty.
The senator rebuked western media for negative propaganda on the situation in Hong Kong, saying the U.S. media has a tradition of spreading fake news on the consent of its government.
""They (the western media) are trying to raise the temperature politically to put pressure on China and to destabilize China. So there is always something (in the U.S. media's plan) called the 'China card,' something to put pressure on China ... Now it is Hong Kong,"" he said.
To misguide the world about the real situation in Hong Kong and create undue hype of the protests, western media reports are spreading false information by giving inflated figures of the number of the protestors, the senator said.
""The purpose is manipulated politically to convey messages and to convey a narrative, as if the whole of Hong Kong was in revolt, which is not true at all. They want to encourage and fan the flames of unrest, because it suits them,"" he said.
He also questioned the double standards of western social media giants Twitter and Facebook for their politically motivated censorship policy, under which they suspended hundreds of accounts unveiling real images of violence riots in Hong Kong.
Syed said some images of recent meetings between a U.S. diplomat and Hong Kong's riot figures and separatists were released, which clearly showed the U.S. involvement and interference in Hong Kong.
""We have seen this pattern is being followed in some of the color revolutions, which was used by the United States to deploy, to destabilize certain countries of the world, (as) the same pattern we see in Hong Kong.""
Given the economic development of Hong Kong in the last 20 years, the ""one country, two systems"" policy is proved to be a success, Syed said.
Hong Kong's GDP reached nearly 360 billion U.S. dollars in 2018, over twice that of 1996. The number of visitors to Hong Kong soared from 10.4 million in 1997 to more than 65 million in 2018.
""Now Hong Kong has new opportunities (brought by) the Belt and Road Initiative, as Hong Kong is part of the maritime silk road,"" he added.
""Hong Kong belongs to China, Hong Kong's future will feature prosperity, peace and progress,"" Syed said, adding that no one can separate Hong Kong from China."
"Commissioner's office of Chinese foreign ministry in HK criticizes foreign media's ""irresponsible"" comments","HONG KONG, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- The Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) has criticized certain foreign media's irresponsible comments on the situation in Hong Kong as ""full of ignorance, prejudice and arrogance.""
In a statement published on its website late Thursday, the commissioner's office said its spokesperson lodged stern representations with the Wall Street Journal immediately after the newspaper published an editorial on Thursday, expressing strong disapproval and firm opposition.
The spokesperson said the editorial, titled ""The Hong Kong Stakes for Trump"", distorts the truth and arbitrarily comments on the Hong Kong situation.
""Such irresponsible remarks are full of ignorance, prejudice and arrogance,"" the spokesperson pointed out.
""Hong Kong is an inalienable part of China, and its affairs are completely China's internal affairs which allow no foreign intervention. The editorial, however, talks about a possible 'invasion of Hong Kong' by China which 'would violate China's treaty with Britain'. Isn't that typical ignorance?""
""It also alleges that the SAR government is 'the real provocateur', accuses the police dedicated to enforcing the law and maintaining the order for 'brutality', and whitewashes the rioters by claiming they have 'reasonable' worries and are part of 'peaceful protests'. Isn't that typical prejudice?""
""Moreover, it puts on an air of a global policeman, petitions to US policymakers and even urges US president to meddle with Hong Kong affairs with 'blunt candor'. What an epitome of arrogance!""
The spokesperson emphasized that the truth can never be overshadowed by ignorance, prejudice and arrogance, and the public will not be easily fooled.
""We urge the relevant media to immediately correct its mistakes, cover Hong Kong in an objective, impartial, balanced and responsible manner, and make constructive efforts to facilitate understanding of Hong Kong and maintain the city's rule of law, prosperity and stability,"" the spokesperson said."
"Interview: Radical protesters responsible for violence in Hong Kong, expert says","by Zhuang Beining, Che Hongliang
YANGON, Aug. 28 (Xinhua) -- Radical protesters should be held responsible for the violence in Hong Kong, a senior Myanmar expert on international studies has said.
The ""one country, two systems"" principle is of constructive significance for regional and global peace, stability and economic development, and the current situation in Hong Kong should be blamed on plotters of the demonstrations and those who destroy peace and create chaos, said U Khin Maung Lynn, joint secretary of the Myanmar Institute for Strategic and International Studies.
The situation in Hong Kong impacts China and the region, U Khin Maung Lynn told Xinhua in a recent interview. ""We are also watching it closely. China, like Myanmar, had been under British oppression before. Chinese leaders formulated the policy of 'one country, two systems,' which multilaterally benefits the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and the whole region.""
He said that under the principle of ""one country, two systems,"" Hong Kong has been developing increasingly better, promoting the development of Hong Kong and also that of Shenzhen, Macao and other areas connected with Hong Kong. ""When violent demonstrations take place, I express regret and hope the issue will be resolved in a peaceful way.""
""The Hong Kong people certainly want peace, stability and economic development,"" the expert added. ""China also wants Hong Kong to develop. The blame for the current situation rests primarily with those who instigated the demonstrators, saboteurs of peace and those who deliberately created chaos. The rule of law is needed everywhere and I condemn illegal violence.""
Speaking of Western media coverage, U Khin Maung Lynn said that when some conflicts occur in Myanmar, Western media always make some exaggerated reports or even create fake ones for desired effects, and they often turn a blind eye to positive and correct things.
Western media mislead the outside world by such means, which is a moral misconduct, he said.
As to violent demonstrations, U Khin Maung Lynn said the police have anti-violence programs and should control the demonstrators who cause violence. It is the police's duty to protect people's property and enforce the law, he added.
""The Hong Kong issue is China's internal affair...The situation will become more complicated if outsiders intervene, as Myanmar has first-hand experience,"" U Khin Maung Lynn said. ""We hope China will develop. China is a friendly neighbor of Myanmar and the two countries have paukphaw (fraternal) friendship."""
Roundup: Hong Kong violence escalates with cut-throat attack on police,"HONG KONG, Oct. 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong saw another violent night on Sunday as radical protesters, despite smaller in numbers, popped up in various districts to smash shops, vandalize metro stations and launch firebomb and cut-throat attacks against police.
In an alarming escalation of violence, a rioter attacked with a sharp object and slashed an officer's neck at the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) Kwun Tong station at about 5:30 p.m. local time.
The injured officer, with his neck bleeding but in conscious state, has been sent to hospital. Two suspects were arrested at the scene, the Hong Kong police said.
Unauthorized demonstrations and gatherings began to rage multiple locations across Hong Kong on Sunday afternoon, and soon escalated into violence after groups of masked rioters went on rampage again.
Radical protesters were seen hurling bricks and shouting obscenities at police officers. In Sha Tin, thugs threw petrol bombs from height targeting a police vehicle and set it ablaze.
At the busy market areas of Mong Kok, rioters assaulted another police officer, bludgeoning him and attempting to snatch his rifle, a TV footage showed.
As violence continued into the evening, over 20 fire bombs were hurled at the Mong Kok police station at about 9:00 p.m., setting off a huge blaze in its front. An explosion was also heard near a moving police vehicle on the Nathan Road.
Shops with Chinese mainland backgrounds and residents who held different political views were also attacked by roaming battalions of mobsters, who allegedly adopted the strategy of popping up in multiple locations at the same time to maximize disruption.
In an orgy of violence, they blocked major roads and vandalized public facilities, including traffic lights, MTR stations, government buildings, and offices of district councillors. Numerous shops in shopping malls including Starbucks and Huawei were smashed, prompting police to charge into the malls to nab the vandals.
Police said they had fired tear gas to disperse those violent demonstrators after acts of violence and criminal damage were reported in both Sha Tin and Tsuen Wan.
The MTR Corp, operator of Hong Kong's train network, had to suspend train services of all the light rail routes and dozens of MTR stations again as masked rioters vandalized stations and hurled objects into the rail track.
The Hong Kong police said such acts neglected the safety of members of the public as the station was in operation at the material time.
As violence spread, the town hall, a swimming pool, a sports center and some other public facilities in Sha Tin district were forced to close, while all leisure facilities in Tsuen Wan district and all swimming pools in Tuen Mun district have been closed.
Since June, the Asian trading and financial hub has been plagued by unrest originating from protests over the proposed ordinance amendments concerning fugitives' transfers.
Although the HKSAR government has withdrawn the amendments, violence continued as protesters veered off their original agenda to raise the ante, causing a split in society and taking a heavy toll on the economy.
On Sunday night, the HKSAR government expressed ""extreme outrage"" at recurrent violent acts of masked rioters, who it said obviously targeted police officers for attacks."
China voices firm opposition to G7 statement on Hong Kong,"BEIJING, Aug. 27 (Xinhua) -- China on Tuesday voiced strong dissatisfaction with and resolute opposition to ""random accusations"" and ""irresponsible remarks"" on Hong Kong affairs in a statement from the Group of Seven (G7) summit.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang made the remarks at a daily press briefing.
The G7 reportedly reaffirmed the existence and the importance of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong and called for avoiding violence in a joint statement issued Monday at the end of a G7 summit held in Biarritz, France.
""As we have emphasized on many occasions, Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs, and no foreign governments, organizations or individuals have the right to intervene,"" said Geng, when responding to a query about China's comment on the statement from the G7 summit.
The demonstrations and violent protests have been running in Hong Kong for more than two months, and Hong Kong's rule of law, social order, economy and wellbeing of the people, as well as its international image have been severely impacted as a result, Geng said.
""No one cares more about Hong Kong's prosperity and stability than Chinese people, including residents of Hong Kong,"" Geng said. ""(Those) are our own affairs, we will handle them well. G7 members should not poke their noses into others' business with ill-harbored intentions and conspiracies.""
On the aforementioned Joint Declaration between China and Britain, Geng said its ultimate goal and core content were to make sure China would take back Hong Kong in 1997 and the government of the People's Republic of China would resume its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong with effect from July 1, 1997.
""Since Hong Kong returned to the motherland in 1997, the Chinese government has exercised jurisdiction over Hong Kong according to the Constitution and the Basic Law,"" he said. ""Based on international law and basic norms governing international relations, no other country or organization is entitled to meddle in Hong Kong affairs under the pretext of the Joint Declaration."""
"Chinese FM denounces violence, foreign interference in Hong Kong","PARIS, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi here on Monday slammed the violence and foreign interference in Hong Kong.
In an interview with AFP during his visit to France, Wang reiterated that issues related to Hong Kong are China's internal affairs, and that according to the Charter of the United Nations, no country has the right to determine the internal affairs of any other nation.
Wang said one basic fact about Hong Kong is that what is going on in the Chinese city nowadays is in no way peaceful protests, but pure and simple street violence. Some rioters, wearing similar clothes and face masks and holding iron rods and Molotov cocktails, have unscrupulously committed crimes, he added.
Wang accused the mobs of smashing shops, damaging public facilities, beating up innocent citizens, paralyzing airports and even openly attacking police, threatening their lives. These are crimes and cannot be tolerated in any country or any society, Wang said.
Hong Kong has always been advocating the rule of law, any action should be conducted within the framework of the law, and any discontent should not be an excuse for violence, Wang said.
He noted that the most significant thing for Hong Kong now is to stop violence, curb disorder, restore order and administer the city by law.
Wang said another basic fact about Hong Kong is that some foreign forces, including some media outlets, turning a blind eye to what is really happening and even calling white black, have called the street violence a pro-democracy move and branded the police deployment in accordance with law as violence.
Wang said some foreign forces have encouraged and indulged the street crimes so as to upset Hong Kong, and ruin its prosperity built by generations of hard work and its great historic progress achieved since the implementation of the ""one country, two systems"" policy.
These attempts will never and can never succeed, Wang added.
People in Hong Kong will certainly recognize these agendas of the foreign forces, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government will certainly restore the rule of law, and China's central government will certainly stick to the ""one country, two systems"" principle according to the constitution and the Basic Law, Wang said.
Wang expressed the hope that people with conscience around the globe will view the situation in Hong Kong objectively and impartially.
The violence in Hong Kong is being imitated elsewhere, for example in Spain's Catalonia, Britain's London, and the streets of Chile, he noted, saying some demonstrators have announced that they would turn their cities into another Hong Kong and imitate the street violence there.
Some even called the violence in Hong Kong ""a beautiful landscape,"" and such remarks made by those people have lost the minimum conscience, Wang said."
Feature: Concerns over unrest haunt Hong Kong's Lan Kwai Fong on Halloween,"HONG KONG, Oct. 31 (Xinhua) -- Lan Kwai Fong, a famous nightclub zone in Hong Kong's Central district that is popular with Halloween revelers, saw a low-profile Halloween eve on Thursday, as many restaurants and bars closed early for safety concerns due to an unauthorized protest.
Posts on LIHKG, an online forum frequently used to initiate illegal demonstrations during the months-long unrest in Hong Kong, have been calling for a march on Thursday evening from Victoria Park in Causeway Bay to Lan Kwai Fong.
The Hong Kong police have warned that the planned march is an unauthorized assembly that will pose serious threat to public order and public safety, and reminded shops in the vicinity to be updated with the latest situation and close earlier if necessary so as to ensure the safety of lives and properties.
Unlike previous years, Lan Kwai Fong was not heavily decorated for Halloween this year, while rows of water-filled barriers were deployed as a precaution on the narrow streets and policemen with riot-control gears could be seen at different intersections in the area before nightfall.
Road closure measures were implemented much earlier than previous years in the area. Several streets around the area were closed from 2 p.m. on Thursday to 6 a.m. Friday.
The MTR Corporation, the operator of Hong Kong's mass transit railway, also said earlier Thursday that considering the risk level for this day, the Central Station near Lan Kwai Fong would be closed from 9 p.m. local time.
Concerns for safety have left many shops in Lan Kwai Fong with low expectations for business on the Halloween eve. A waiter of a restaurant surnamed Lee said the number of customers might decrease by over 60 percent compared with the same period of previous years.
Lan Kwai Fong Association, a non-profit organization that groups over 100 businesses in the area, said there would be no special promotion for Halloween this year due to the recent social atmosphere in Hong Kong.
As the prolonged unrest gripped Hong Kong for over four months, the restaurant and bar sector has seen a remarkable decline in the number of both local customers and visitors, and hundreds of businesses in the sector have been forced to shut down across Hong Kong.
In Lan Kwai Fong, some restaurants that used to be busy were also found closed with leasing ads on their reel gates.
Restaurants and bars were not the only businesses that were suffering. At one entrance of the area, a costume vendor surnamed Wong told Xinhua that he expected a fall by more than half in his sales for the festival this year compared with previous years.
""I don't have high expectations this year. I just hope the community will return to normal soon and the business for next year will improve,"" he said."
Commentary: U.S. opportunists and HK separatists -- expedient bedfellows with doomed plots,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong separatist Joshua Wong Chi-fung and some U.S. lawmakers receiving Wong here in recent days have been trying to convince the world that they are the champions of ""freedom"" and ""democracy"" in Hong Kong. The truth is, they are no more than expedient bedfellows.
At a U.S. Congressional committee's hearing on Tuesday and throughout his stay in the United States over the week, Wong fabricated ""police brutality,"" whitewashed rioters' violent crimes that have seriously damaged the economy and people's way of life in the international financial hub, and begged for U.S. intervention in what should be China's internal affairs.
As Wong got down on his knees and fawned before a bunch of U.S. lawmakers like U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who has been known for building his political fame on smearing China, he was selling his soul and China's vital sovereign interests to the devil.
On the outside, Wong acted like he cared about the ""one country, two systems"" principle. Yet on the inside, Wong and his like-minded separatist fellows are attempting to court foreign powers to undermine the very policy that has ensured Hong Kong's smooth return to China more than 22 years ago and the city's continued stability and prosperity over the decades, deny Beijing's constitutional responsibilities over Hong Kong, and get more greenbacks and headlines from the United States for their anti-China political movements. In their eyes, Hong Kong's autonomy and Beijing's legitimate jurisdiction are mutually exclusive.
However, these U.S. politicians will disappoint Wong eventually. That's because people like Pelosi and Rubio are pure opportunists who are only interested in using these separatists to get attention and put on get-tough-on-China political shows so as to score cheap political points.
By urging U.S. firms to suspend sales of law enforcement equipment to Hong Kong, staging one-sided hearings and pushing for the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, the motives of the Pelosis and the Rubios are simple: to portray themselves as the guardians of Western values.
However, when U.S. police used pepper spray and rubber bullets against demonstrators in the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement, politicians like Pelosi neither stood up against police brutality nor spoke up for the rights of the protesters. The hypocrisy and double standards of their Hong Kong moves are too obvious to miss.
More ironically, these arrogant politicians seem to be serving American voters by pointing fingers at the internal affairs of other countries. Given America's highly-charged partisan politics and an utterly fractured society, perhaps they find it a lot easier and more cost-effective to make trouble for others than to fix real problems perplexing the United States, like stopping the ever rampant shootings.
What truly matters to them is their own political self-interests, not the so-called human rights or liberty in Hong Kong they pretend to champion or the well-being of the American public, not to mention the interests of those foreign extremists like Wong. As long as they can get elected, nothing seems to be beneath their bottom line, if they have one.
At the end of the day, the plots by Wong, Pelosi and Rubio will go under. They have overestimated their ability to stoke anti-China sentiment in the international community, and underrated Beijing's determination to stop violence and restore order and stability in Hong Kong according to law. More importantly, their ultimate defeat has been preordained by the expedient nature of their bedfellowship."
"HK police warn of escalated violence, vow to bring all offenders to justice","HONG KONG, Aug. 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police on Wednesday said there has been escalated violence in protests and assemblies over the past two months, pledging every effort to bring all offenders to justice.
Speaking at a daily press conference, Tse Chun-chung, chief superintendent of police public relations branch, said radical acts have sprung up and spread out across various districts in Hong Kong. ""The escalation and extension of violence have caused widespread fear among the public.""
Tse cited the unlawful and violent acts, including setting barricades on major roads, dismantling railings, tying up innocent visitors, throwing petrol bombs and metal sticks, and hitting civilians and reporters.
""These radical protesters are tearing our society apart and tearing down our core values, including the rule of law,"" Tse said, adding that the whole society has started to pay the price.
Retail sales, tourism and logistics bore the first blow and the shadow is looming on the broader economy. As far, 31 countries and regions have issued travel advisories for Hong Kong. ""Visitors are having second thought about coming to Hong Kong. It is high time to stop all acts of violence and restore Hong Kong public safety and order,"" Tse said.
Tse said the Hong Kong police take every case very seriously and have zero-tolerance for all unlawful acts, vowing to make every effort to bring all offenders to justice. Since the past weekend, the Hong Kong police have arrested 26 people suspected of participating in serious violent incidents since June 9.
No on-spot arrest does not mean the police will neglect the crime, Tse said. Over the past two months, nearly 900 people involved in violent incidents have been arrested."
"Feature: Hong Kong residents gather to express reverence to Chinese national emblem, flag","HONG KONG, Aug. 8 (Xinhua) -- A group of Hong Kong residents gathered on Thursday morning at a pier of the Victoria Harbor to express their reverence to the Chinese national emblem and flag. 
To the music of ""Ode to the Motherland,"" they unfurled several Chinese national flags and waved banners that read ""safeguarding the national dignity.""
Later, they sang the national anthem of China in unison, drawing attention and acclaim from a large crowd of passers-by in a luxury shopping district in Tsim Sha Tsui of the Kowloon Peninsula.
""As Chinese, we were all saddened by recent acts of insulting the national emblem and flag,"" said the organizer of the gathering, who only gave his surname Lim. ""We won't allow anyone to tarnish our national image.""
Over the past several days, radical protesters twice removed the Chinese national flags from the flagpole at the pier and flung the flags into the water.
""A national flag represents the dignity of a country. These insulting acts drew an outpouring of anger from all Chinese,"" said an elderly participant named Hsui Kit Fan.
During a demonstration in July, some radical protesters besieged the building of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and defaced the national emblem.
""We were all furious over the recent incidents of insulting our national emblem and flag. These kinds of acts should never be tolerated,"" said another participant surnamed Wong.
Wong said many of her family members are working in the police force and she felt heartsore to see them work day and night to keep public order.
""I hope the chaotic situation will subside and we can get back to our normal days as soon as possible,"" she said.
In a statement issued by the participants, they called on the law enforcement agencies of Hong Kong to swiftly bring the perpetrators who insulted the national emblem and flag to justice.
""The perpetrators must face severe punishment. This is the only way to prevent the situation from getting worse,"" said the statement.
Over the past two months, protests in Hong Kong have escalated into a spate of violent incidents, threatening social order and endangering public safety.
Hong Kong is facing the most severe situation since its return to the motherland, said Zhang Xiaoming, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, on Wednesday.
""The most pressing and overriding task at present is to stop violence, end the chaos and restore order, so as to safeguard our homeland and prevent Hong Kong from sinking into an abyss,"" Zhang said."
"Interview: Restoring social stability crucial to Hong Kong's future, Georgia's former envoy to China says","TBILISI, Sept. 5 (Xinhua) -- Protests in any form should be peaceful, by no means through radical actions and disruption of normal life, David Aptsiauri, former Georgian ambassador to China, has said.
""We think that any protest should be expressed in peaceful ways through dialogue, readiness for consensus solutions and not by means of radical actions and disruption of normal life of the community,"" Aptsiauri, also general director of the Georgian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told Xinhua recently.
Aptsiauri stressed that social stability is vitally important for further economic development and improvement of living standards in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong's closer cooperation with the Chinese mainland ""means increasing new job opportunities and growth of trade and tourism,"" Aptsiauri said, calling on the people in Hong Kong to cherish and maintain peace and stability.
Aptsiauri recalled he had visited Hong Kong several times as the former ambassador to China and was impressed by the progress the city made after its reunification with the Chinese mainland.
""I would like to reiterate that Georgia firmly supports the 'one country, two systems' principle,"" he said.
Hong Kong has since June suffered from prolonged and escalating violence that originated from demonstrations over proposed ordinance amendments concerning fugitive offenders.
The Hong Kong police said the level of aggression by demonstrators has been the highest in decades."
HKSAR chief executive strongly condemns some protesters' violent acts at LegCo buildi,"HONG KONG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Carrie Lam on Tuesday strongly condemned the violent acts of some protesters who stormed the Legislative Council (LegCo) building.
Lam said she was saddened and shocked by the use of violence and vandalism, stressing that any illegal acts committed by the protesters would be investigated.
""This is something that we should seriously condemn because nothing is more important than the rule of law in Hong Kong,"" she told the media. ""I hope community at large will agree with us that with these violent acts that we have seen, it is right for us to condemn it and hope the society will return to normal as soon as possible."" 
On Monday night, some radical protesters stormed into the Legislative complex and destroyed equipment inside the chamber of the building.
After the midnight, the police cleared roadblocks and drove off protesters who were staying in the Legislative Council complex.
Speaking with the media early Tuesday, Lam said that some protesters confronted the police, blocked roads and used unidentified liquid to attack police officers on Monday.
Some protesters tried to intrude the LegCo Complex, using a roll cage trolley as a battering ram and iron poles to shatter glass doors of the LegCo. They, during the clash, also threw toxic powder at the police.
On Monday evening, a number of protesters stormed into the complex, destroyed the chamber and defaced the Hong Kong emblem."
Suspected counterfeit press cards seized during arrest operation: HK police,"HONG KONG, Sept. 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police said on Sunday that during an arrest operation in a store at Sai Ying Pun Saturday afternoon, suspected counterfeit press cards and suspected offensive weapons were seized.
Speaking at a press conference, Chief Inspector (Crime) of Western District Ng Kei-chun said that six men and two women were also arrested for possessing offensive weapons.
During the arrest operation, 12 press cards were seized, three of which contained personal data matching those of the three arrested persons, said Ng.
However, initial probes by the police found no information available about the media organizations on the press cards.
The police had also seized suspected assault weapons including axes, steel balls, steel ball launchers and corrosive liquids, said Ng.
Noting that in recent protests, some radical protesters had used corrosive liquids against police officers, Ng said there were reasonable grounds to believe that the suspects were making offensive weapons."
"1st LD: Hong Kong chief executive, public representatives hold 1st community dialogue to ""seek change for betterment of HK""","HONG KONG, Sept. 26 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam said Thursday at the first ""Community Dialogue"" session that she hopes to ""seek change for the betterment of Hong Kong society"" through continued dialogues with the public.
In her opening speech at the session, Lam stressed that the dialogue is ""not just for the sake of dialogue, nor is it a public relations tactic.""
""It is to seek change for the betterment of Hong Kong society,"" she said, adding that she hopes more dialogues in different forms will be continuously held in the future in different parts of Hong Kong and more members of the public can participate.
The first ""Community Dialogue"" session, held Thursday evening at Queen Elizabeth Stadium in Wan Chai, was attended by four secretaries of the HKSAR government and about 150 members of the public selected by computer lot drawing from the over 20,000 people who had registered for attending the session.
Lam said Hong Kong residents, irrespective of their status and position, felt pain, anxiety and anger in the past three months, and the HKSAR government should shoulder the major responsibility for finding a way out of the current impasse.
Acknowledging the shrinking public confidence in the HKSAR government and in herself, the chief executive said ""direct dialogue should be initiated no matter how difficult it is.""
""I hope we can take the difficult first step with the understanding and support of the public,"" she said.
Ballots were drawn to select speakers from the audience, each of whom could speak within three minutes. The chief executive and other officials occasionally responded to the speakers.
Both protesters and opponents of the protests have spoken out during the interactive section, which saw repeated mentions of housing problems, social inequality and politicizing of education, among others.
One female speaker opposed students' participation in protests and blamed some teachers, social welfare practitioners and religious groups for instigating protests.
""Students are not mature enough to engage in politics,"" she said, adding that partiality in the liberal studies course had a bad influence on Hong Kong students.
She also blasted fake journalists and biased media reports for stirring up troubles, winning thunderous applause from the audience.
A man who identified himself as among the ""peaceful, rational and non-violent"" protesters, said he was dissatisfied with the social gap and chaos today.
""We all have families and children, I don't know how to hand the future to our next generation,"" he said, expressing hope that peace could be restored soon.
Another speaker noted Hong Kong's exorbitant house prices and yawning wealth gap and asked Lam if measures would be taken to help the young people in terms of housing and employment.
Since June, Hong Kong has witnessed escalating violence that originated from protests over the proposed ordinance amendments concerning fugitive offenders transfers.
Though the HKSAR government has withdrawn the amendments, violence continued as protesters veered off their original agenda to raise the ante, causing a split in society and taking a heavy toll on the economy."
"Spotlight: American living in Hong Kong tells true story about ""peaceful protesters""","HONG KONG, Nov. 6 (Xinhua) -- More than five months ago, Dan Albertson, 35, left Chicago where he had lived for 10 years to start a new life in Hong Kong. Like many other travelers, he looked forward to the fresh experience in this free and open international metropolis of China.
However, violent protests and destructive activities erupted all of a sudden and kept intensifying in the months following.
""Parts of my neighborhood are now ransacked almost every weekend. It has become as predictable as the sunrise. I am tired of seeing this needless destruction, and tired of the excuses, the justifications, the silence,"" the U.S. writer and translator said in an open letter published on Facebook.
Covering a wide range of topics from the rampage of rioters to distortion in media reports, the open letter was translated into Chinese and published by multiple media outlets.
Albertson, living in a small apartment in Kowloon, has witnessed with his own eyes how escalating violence and lawlessness pushed the prosperous, dynamic global financial and trade center into chaos inch by inch since June.
""I thought that I had to write something and express to people what it is like in Hong Kong. It requires one to speak out, because to remain silent is to become complicit,"" Albertson said.
While those contributing to the months-long unrest in Hong Kong were described as ""peaceful protesters"" in some media reports, Albertson believes the term can only be used with quotation marks.
""They are obviously not peaceful,"" Albertson said, citing violent acts including vandalism of public facilities, destruction in stores and bitter assaults on residents holding different views. ""The only thing that they can show is that they can destroy.""
Over the weekend, Hong Kong was again under the rampage of mobsters. Besides routine activities from blocking roads and hurling petrol bombs to attacking police and trashing shops, the office building of a media outlet was vandalized.
More than 300 were arrested over illegal and violent acts and 12 police officers were injured.
In the past few months, 85 metro stations had been damaged, 460 sets of traffic lights out of order, and more than 40,000 meters of iron railing were torn down.
""There's no way you can have a better life by destroying your city,"" Albertson said. ""When you smash stores, you also smash the ability of somebody to do what you and I do, which is to do a job and to get paid for it. Nobody has the right to do that.""
Some protesters once told Albertson that there was no more important issue in Hong Kong right now than taking to street. ""I was very skeptical,"" he said.
""There are many other issues in Hong Kong, like building more affordable housing, making the transit better, and controlling air pollution, which are something that can actually make Hong Kong a better place,"" Albertson said.
Albertson said unfortunately his friends in Europe and the United States did not know what was happening in Hong Kong as there was a big gap between some media reports and the real situation.
""I read a lot of irresponsible reports about unconfirmed information, even rumors, and releases of selective and edited videos to show police brutality,"" Albertson said.
""If there's one police officer surrounded by a group of people, what do you expect him to do? Do you expect him to lie down and let people beat him up that way? The media outlets never showed protesters action before. They want you to see the after video,"" Albertson said.
In regard of the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 pushed by some U.S. lawmakers, Albertson thought it was groundless as the rights of Hong Kong residents were fully guaranteed from his knowledge.
""Instead, the protesters have too much freedom. I would struggle to think of a place where you could do this kind of behavior for more than 20 weekends in a row,"" Albertson said.
Albertson loves to travel and has visited many parts of the world, including some cities in the Chinese mainland. Trips were also made by him to Hong Kong many times before. He deplored the fact that the used-to-be free and inclusive place has been plunged deeper and deeper into violence.
Expected to leave Hong Kong in a year due to job changes, Albertson hopes to see restored peace when he is still here. ""I love Hong Kong, I want to see it remain an inviting, inclusive and special place,"" he said."
Hong Kong education groups appeal to young people to stay away from violence,"HONG KONG, Sept. 30 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five education groups in Hong Kong issued a joint statement on Monday to appeal to young people not to engage in violent or illegal activities.
Over the past few months, many young people participated in violent protests and paid a high price for it. ""As educators, we are deeply saddened by this,"" the statement said.
The statement said that recently some people on the internet threatened to escalate the violence and called for more vigorous actions. The education sector is deeply concerned about this, worrying that more students will get involved in it.
""We appeal earnestly to young people to protect themselves, stay away from violent scenes, and do not participate in illegal acts, so as not to harm themselves and ruin their future,"" the statement said.
The education groups hoped that parents and educators pay more attention to young people and teach them to stay away from violence and hatred.
Hong Kong Higher Education Convergence said in a press release on Monday that recent protests have become constant illegal violent activities, and a large number of students were arrested since June.
It appealed to young people to cherish themselves and their relationships with families, and not to break the law."

Former chief justice of HKSAR Court of Final Appeal denounces violence,"HONG KONG, Sept. 30 (Xinhua) -- A former chief justice in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) denounced continued violence in Hong Kong after a fresh bout of unrest on Sunday, when radicals vandalized subway stations, set fires, hurled petrol bombs and assaulted ordinary people.
Andrew Li Kwok-nang, former chief justice of the HKSAR Court of Final Appeal, called on people to make their appeals in a peaceful and rational way in a statement on Sunday, according to local media reports on Monday.
""Hong Kong residents' freedom of speech, assembly and demonstration is guaranteed by the policy of 'one country, two systems',"" he said, adding that Hong Kong is a society under the rule of law and when people enjoy their freedom, they should behave in a lawful and responsible manner.
Li noted that violence could not solve problems. ""In a society under the rule of law, such (violent) acts should not be tolerated,"" he said. ""They should be strongly condemned.""
The Asian trading and financial hub has been plagued since June by unrest that originated from protests over the proposed ordinance amendments concerning fugitive offenders transfers.
Although the HKSAR government has withdrawn the amendments, violence continued as protesters veered off their original agenda to raise the ante, causing a split in society and taking a heavy toll on the economy.
On Sept. 26, Chief Executive of the HKSAR Carrie Lam and other officials had candid communication with the members of the public at the first ""Community Dialogue."" Lam said she will continue reaching out to people through dialogues to seek a way out for Hong Kong."

"2nd LD Writethru: Hong Kong radical protesters throw petrol bombs, beat passer-by","HONG KONG, Sept. 28 (Xinhua) -- Radical protesters blocked roads and threw petrol bombs outside the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government offices on Saturday evening.
At least one person was assaulted by black-clad men until his face was bleeding.
Hong Kong police deployed water cannons and fired pepper spray and tear gas to disperse the violent protesters who also damaged properties in Hong Kong's Admiralty area.
At around 6:30 p.m. local time, some radical protesters began charging the police cordon line and aimed laser beams at police officers at the entrance of the HKSAR goverment headquarters complex.
At around 7:30 p.m., a large group of protesters blocked the carriageways in nearby Harcourt Road, paralyzing the traffic.
Some violent protesters damaged properties outside the government headquarters complex and pointed laser beams at a helicopter, posing serious threat to the safety of everyone at scene, according to the Hong Kong police.
A man in a white T-shirt was assaulted in the Tamar Park after he shouted ""Hong Kong is forever a part of China"" in Mandarin.
Video footage showed him being dragged down to the ground, beaten and kicked hard by a crowd of black-clad men who yelled ""go to hell,"" until his head was broken with blood in his face.
After he struggled to sit up, the man was heard crying ""we are all Chinese, why should we hurt each other?""
In a statement, police said after giving repeated warnings to the protesters in vain, they used minimum force.
Meanwhile, in the nearby HKSAR Legislative Council (LegCo) complex, LegCo Secretariat issued a red alert and required all persons to evacuate from the LegCo complex immediately.
At about 8:45 p.m., police water cannon trucks fired blue jets of water to disperse violent protesters, who hurled bricks at police officers and threw petrol bombs at the government office buildings.
Traffic authorities said several bus routes were suspended or changed routes after protesters blocked roads in Admiralty with traffic cones and other objects.
The HKSAR government issued a statement on Saturday night, strongly condemning the violence around the government headquarters.
Since June, Hong Kong has witnessed escalating violence that originated from protests over the proposed ordinance amendments concerning fugitive offenders transfers.
Although the HKSAR government has withdrawn the amendments, violence continued as protesters veered off their original agenda to raise the ante, causing a split in society and taking a heavy toll on the economy.

China responds to U.S. remarks on Hong Kong: FM spokesperson,"BEIJING, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- China on Friday responded to U.S. President Donald Trump's remarks concerning the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
According to reports, the U.S. President tweeted Thursday that a meeting between Chinese leader and Hong Kong's protesters could lead to a happy ending of the protests.
When asked for comments on this, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said that China has noticed Trump used to say that ""the riots"" in Hong Kong had lasted for a long time.
""Violent criminal activities in Hong Kong have escalated continuously since June,"" Hua said, noting such activities ruthlessly trampled on the rule of law and social order, seriously undermined Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, and openly challenged the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
The spokesperson said the most urgent and overriding task at present is to stop the violence and restore order in accordance with the law.
""The central government firmly supports Chief Executive Carrie Lam in leading the SAR government to administer the SAR in accordance with the law, and the Hong Kong police in strictly enforcing the law,"" she said, adding the central government also firmly supports the punishment of violent criminals in accordance with the law."
Commissioner's Office of China's foreign ministry in HK urges U.S. congressmen to make clean break from violent extremists,"HONG KONG, Aug. 13 (Xinhua) -- A spokesperson for the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Tuesday denounced some U.S. congressmen for making groundless accusations against the Central and the SAR governments, and urged them to make a clean break from the violent extremists.
It is reported that U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and some others claimed that ""Beijing tries to encroach on their [Hong Kong people's] autonomy and freedom"" and that ""Any violent crackdown would be completely unacceptable."" The spokesperson of the commissioner's office replied that the remarks have distorted the truth and made groundless accusations against the Central and the SAR governments, sending out a gravely wrong signal to the violent extremists. China deplores and firmly opposes such allegations, reads a statement on the office website.
A handful of radical protesters in Hong Kong have ramped up extremist and violent actions, and kept assaulting the police in a highly dangerous and brutal manner. Such acts have grossly trampled upon the rule of law and social order of Hong Kong, posed a grave threat to the security of the citizens, seriously challenged Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and tested the red line of ""one country, two systems"", said the spokesperson.
While showing no mercy towards those who assault police at home, the U.S. selectively turns a blind eye when it comes to Hong Kong, painting instead the Hong Kong police's efforts to enforce law in a civilized manner despite malicious attacks and humiliation as a ""crackdown"" on peaceful protests. It only fully reveals the entrenched prejudice, hypocrisy, indifference, selfishness and hegemonic thinking of some American politicians, the spokesperson added.
Since the return of Hong Kong to the motherland 22 years ago, the principle of ""one country, two systems"", ""the people of Hong Kong governing Hong Kong"" and a high degree of autonomy in the SAR have been faithfully implemented. Our Hong Kong compatriots are now their own masters with unprecedented rights and freedoms in accordance with law. Hong Kong ranked the 16th for its rule of law in 2018 -- higher than that of the U.S. -- while it ranked below 60th in 1996. These are solid facts which cannot be easily denied by American politicians, the spokesperson said.
People cannot help but ask: Would these politicians only be satisfied to see Hong Kong descend into a city of violence? And would that dark scenario alone meet their standards for autonomy and freedoms?, the spokesperson continued.
The spokesperson emphasized that Hong Kong is part of China, and its affairs are completely China's domestic affairs, which allow no interference by any foreign country, organization or individual in any form.
No one should ever underestimate China's determination to uphold national sovereignty and security and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, or expect China to yield to the intimidation and pressure from foreign interfering forces, he said.
""We strongly urge the American politicians to abide by international law and basic norms governing international relations, and respect the just aspiration of the majority of Hong Kong citizens to oppose violence, uphold the rule of law and support the police,"" the spokesperson said, urging the U.S. politicians to know their place, have a correct assessment of the situation, immediately make a clean break from the violent extremists, and stop meddling with Hong Kong affairs, which are China's domestic affairs."
"Xinhua Headlines: Malicious slanders widen rifts, fuel violence in Hong Kong","A fire is blazing at a Mass Transit Railway (MTR) station in Hong Kong, south China, Sept. 8, 2019.  (Xinhua)Much of the misinformation has been used by radical protesters as pretexts to resort to more violence, slander police and government authorities, and stir up hatred.The HKSAR government will try its best to provide a timely account of information and facts, Lam said, adding that a special section has been set up on the government's website to clarify rumors at a timely manner.
HONG KONG, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Persistent rumors and fake news have exacerbated social tensions and whipped up violent activities in Hong Kong over the past three months.Much of the misinformation has been used by radical protesters as pretexts to resort to more violence, slander police and government authorities, and stir up hatred. Hong Kong authorities have made tremendous efforts to provide the facts and stop people from engaging in speculation.A large part of the daily press conferences held by the Hong Kong police was spent on clarifying various types of unfounded comments about police operations. Though police spokespersons repeatedly refuted these allegations, some media chose not to believe in facts but stuck to their own perspectives.Recently, the opposition and radicals spread rumors about the protester death at Prince Edward MTR station on Aug. 31. Taking this claim as an excuse, radical protesters surrounded and attacked the Mong Kok police station, and went so far to attempt setting up a ""mourning hall"" at the MTR station.On Tuesday, a joint press conference by the police, hospital authority and fire department laid bare the facts, saying neither Mong Kok Police Station nor the police missing persons unit had received any report of missing persons in connection with the incident on Aug. 31.A total of 53 people were arrested at Prince Edward MTR station on the night of Aug. 31, including seven people who needed to be sent to hospitals for treatment.A joint press conference is held by the police, hospital authority, fire department and MTR authority in south China's Hong Kong, Sept. 10, 2019. (Xinhua)The opposition hyped up another incident that a female police officer had strip-searched a female protester for 15 to 30 minutes. The Hong Kong police then clarified that they checked related documents and the CCTV record, and found that the level of the search was not the ""3C"" level which requires a strip search; the whole search took four minutes.Deliberately misinterpreting photos and videos of police operations is another common practice to cook up false accusations against police. A photo of a police officer ""hitting"" non-protesters with his shield had been widely used as proof of police brutality. Video footage later revealed that the officer was holding his shield up to protect passersby as he escorted them out of the danger zone.During a demonstration in Sheung Shui, a protester tried to jump from a six-meter footbridge to flee the police but was saved by several riot police officers who rushed to hold him. The photo was put online but captioned wrongfully saying the police were trying to push the protester off the bridge.A daily press conference of the Hong Kong police is held to announce the launch of 10 anti-violence hotlines in south China's Hong Kong, Sept. 10, 2019. (Xinhua)Agitation and mud-slinging against officers have been recurrent. During a protest at Tsuen Wan on Aug. 25, some violent protesters hurled petrol bombs at the police. However, CNN released a story headlined ""Police use petrol bombs and water cannons against Hong Kong protesters,"" citing a widely circulated tampered video. CNN later apologized for its ""erroneous"" headline and replaced it with a correct one.In another broadly circulated photo, a rioter carrying a gun on his waist was throwing a petrol bomb at the police on Aug. 31. However, the picture was used by the opposition as an ""evidence"" of police personnel disguise as protestors.In response, the police denied the allegation and said the police did not use the gun carried by the protester. ""These vicious slanders are despicable attempts to smear police officers who act in strict accordance with the law,"" said Tse Chun-chung, chief superintendent of the Hong Kong Police Public Relations Branch.The opposition can be very ""creative"" in smearing the Hong Kong police and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government, including the ""smart lamppost"" conspiracy, in which the lampposts installed to collect air, traffic and weather data were said to be ""monitoring"" protesters.The government had explained that the cameras of the lampposts are set to face public areas only and do not carry any facial recognition function. Rioters nevertheless took down one lamppost and damaged 19 others. The total repair fees amounted to 2.8 million Hong Kong dollars (about 360,000 U.S. dollars).Turnstiles are damaged at Mong Kok MTR station in south China's Hong Kong, Sept. 9, 2019. (Xinhua)Misleading information has been rife on social media in recent days in an attempt to sow fear among the public and attack the police and the government. Without a punishment scheme in place against fake news, many local media have actively disseminated false information and flooded the public with a misinformation storm.Local residents said the rumors are unfounded and some are absurd. ""The protesters not only said people died in the Prince Edward MTR station. They said they saw a ghost. They are insane,"" said a resident surnamed Lee who lives nearby.""Both the hospitals and the police have published their reports saying no person died at the station. Why should I not trust the authorities, and get led away by these rumors?"" said another resident surnamed Kwan.""These rioters occupied roads and smashed MTR stations. Ordinary people can not take the metro. They dare not go out in public on weekends. The rioters say this is all for the future; what future do they have if they keep causing so much damage to Hong Kong?"" Kwan asked.Last weekend, rioters sabotaged Central, Wan Chai, Causeway Bay MTR stations in escalated violence, targeting people with different views, police stations and public facilities, police officers said.Police authorities have launched ten anti-violence hotlines to collect information, including photos, audio and video clips via WhatsApp to assist in the prevention and detection of possible crimes.The increasing number of negative, violent and fake information has exacerbated social tensions, said Yip Siu Fai, a professor at the University of Hong Kong.At a press conference Tuesday, HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam urged the public to carefully discern the information they received.The HKSAR government will try its best to provide a timely account of information and facts, Lam said, adding that a special section has been set up on the government's website to clarify rumors at a timely manner.■"
Commissioner's office of Chinese foreign ministry opposes interference in Hong Kong affairs by British politicians,"HONG KONG, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- The Office of Commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) expressed on Friday strong disapproval of and firm opposition against the interference in Hong Kong affairs by British politicians in a statement.
The statement came in response to the unwarranted remarks about Hong Kong made by a certain British senior government official and a report issued by the Foreign Affairs Committee of Britain's House of Commons.
The spokesperson of the commissioner's office said that the politicians have flagrantly interfered in China's internal affairs, and trampled upon international law and basic norms governing international relations.
As violence is wreaking havoc on Hong Kong, it is the common wish of people that the rioters will be held accountable, and the violence and chaos stopped, the spokesperson said.
Some British politicians, however, have run counter to the mainstream public opinion in Hong Kong, confounded the rioter's bloody crime with the police's law enforcement efforts, glorified outright pre-election violence as ""peaceful protest"" and ""a stepping stone to political dialogue"", and smeared Hong Kong's legal system, the spokesperson said.
“They have openly defended Joshua Wong, a political crown clamoring for so-called ‘Hong Kong independence,’ who seriously challenges the red line of ‘one country, two systems’ and undermines Hong Kong's prosperity and stability,” the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson said people cannot help but wondering whether these politicians would only be content to see Hong Kong plunged into the abyss of despair.
“The central government, the SAR government, our compatriots in Hong Kong and international forces for justice will never ever let them have their way,” the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson urged Britain to honor its commitment to support ""one country, two systems"" and oppose ""Hong Kong independence"" with concrete actions, make a clean break from anti-China troublemakers in Hong Kong, and stop endorsing the evil."
Xinhua Headlines: Behind Hong Kong's chaos lie deep-seated social problems,"HONG KONG, Sept. 7 (Xinhua) -- Kwong loves the pure adrenaline rush he gets when he takes his motorcycle out on the weekends to light up his lackluster life.
The 35-year-old lives with his parents in an old and cramped apartment in the New Territories of Hong Kong. He has a girlfriend but is hesitant to get married and start a family.
""The rent is so high, and there is no way I can afford an apartment,"" said Kwong, who earns 15,000 HK dollars (1,950 U.S. dollars) a month. Renting a 30-square meter one-bedroom apartment would cost him about two-thirds of his salary.
""Future? I don't think much about it, just passing each day as it is,"" he said.
Kwong's words reflect the grievances among many people in Hong Kong, particularly the young. Many vented their discontent in prolonged streets protests that have rocked Hong Kong since June.
The demonstrations, which started over two planned amendments to Hong Kong's ordinances concerning fugitive offenders, widened and turned violent over the past months.
""After more than two months of social unrest, it is obvious to many that discontentment extends far beyond the bill,"" said Carrie Lam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), referring to the now-withdrawn amendments.
To Lam, the discontent covers political, economic and social issues, including the often-mentioned problems relating to housing and land supply, income distribution, social justice and mobility and opportunities, for the public to be fully engaged in the HKSAR government's decision-making.
""We can discuss all these issues in our new dialogue platform,"" she said.

UNAFFORDABLE HOUSES
For nine straight years, housing in Hong Kong has been ranked as the least affordable in the world. Homes in the city got further out of reach for most residents, according to Demographia, an urban planning policy consultancy. The city's median property price climbed to 7.16 million HK dollars in 2019, or 20.9 times the median household income in 2018, up from 19.4 times from a year earlier.
In the latest case of house transaction, an apartment of 353 square feet (about 33 square meters) at Mong Kok in central Kowloon was sold at 5.2 million HK dollars in September, according to the registered data from Centaline Property Agency Limited.
For those fortunate enough to have bought an apartment, many have to spend a large part of their monthly income on a mortgage. For those who have not bought any property yet, it is common to spend more than 10,000 HK dollars in rent, while saving every penny up for a multi-million HK dollar down payment.
From 2004 to 2018, the property price increased by 4.4 fold, while income stagnated, statistics show. From 2008 to 2017, average real wage growth in Hong Kong was merely 0.1 percent, according to a global wage report by the International Labor Organization. Homeownership dropped from 53 percent to 48.9 percent from 2003 to 2018.
Efforts of the HKSAR government to increase land supply to stem home prices from soaring also went futile amid endless quarrels. Of Hong Kong's total 1,100 square kilometers of land area, only 24.3 percent has been developed, with land for residential use accounting for a mere 6.9 percent, according to data from the HKSAR government.
Social worker Jack Wong, 29, lives in an apartment bought by his parents. ""I'm lucky. Most of my friends still have to share apartments with their parents. My cousin has been married for seven years, but he is still saving for his down payment, so he has to live at his parents' house,"" he said.
""The older generation changed from having nothing to having something. We, the younger generation, thought we had something, but it turns out we have nothing,"" he said.

MIDDLE CLASS' ANXIETY
While young people complain about having few opportunities for upward mobility, Hong Kong's middle class, which should have long been stalwarts of the society, are under great economic pressure and in fear of falling behind.
It is not easy to be middle class in Hong Kong, one of the world's most expensive cities. To join the rank, a household needs to earn at least 55,000 HK dollars, or 7,000 U.S. dollars, a month, according to Paul Yip Siu-fai, a senior lecturer at the University of Hong Kong. About 10 percent of the households in the city are up to the rank.
Earning that much can be counted as rich in many parts of the world. But in Hong Kong, the money is still tight if you have a child to raise and elderly to support.
Housing is the biggest burden for the average middle-class resident. The cost of having a child is another headache in Hong Kong, where pricey extra-curricular activities and private tutoring are considered necessary to win in the fierce competition.
Fears of descending to the low-income group are real for the middle class. Many think they belong to the middle class only in education and cultural identity, but their living conditions are not much better than the impoverished, said Anthony Cheung Bing-leung, former secretary for transport and housing of the HKSAR government.
Civil servants and teachers, who earn much more than the average income, are traditionally considered middle class. But Cheung found out in a survey that many of them could not afford to have their own apartment, with some even living in the narrow rooms of partitioned apartments.
""We don't belong to the low-income group, but we could just rent an apartment now,"" said Lee, a teacher at a secondary school in Hong Kong.
Lee and her husband earned nearly 1.3 million HK dollars a year, but a 50-square meter apartment is the best they could rent now for a five-member family. She preferred not to give her full name as she feels her situation is embarrassing.
""We want to save more money to buy a house near prestigious elementary schools for our kids,"" Lee said. ""If our kids can't go to a good school, it'll be very tough in the future.""

CHANGING ECONOMIC STRUCTURE
In the 1970s, nearly half of Hong Kong's labor force were industrial workers when manufacturing thrived in Hong Kong. During the 1980s, Hong Kong's finance, shipping, trade and logistics and service industries started to boom.
Since then, the economic landscape began to change amid subsequent industrial upgrading.
Due to the hollowing out of the manufacturing industry, the wealth gap in Hong Kong widened and the class division worsened. Despite the prosperity of finance, trade and tourism in recent years, more than 1.37 million people are living below the poverty line in Hong Kong, home to more than 7 million.
Working career options are now limited, leaving little hope for the youngsters to move up the social ranks.
As a result, Hong Kong's social class has largely been solidified in the 21st century, with the richest people dominated by property developers and their families.
The Gini coefficient, which measures the inequality of income distribution, reached a new high of 0.539 in 2016, far above the warning level of 0.4, according to data by the HKSAR government's Census and Statistics Department. The greater the number toward one, the more inequal in income distribution. 
Though the HKSAR government tried to narrow the wealth gap, many people in Hong Kong said they are not sharing the fruits of economic prosperity, the young and those low-income groups in particular.

STAGNATING POLITICAL BARRIERS
What makes the deep-seated problems in Hong Kong such a hard nut to crack? The reason is complicated, according to observers, partly due to the containment in the current political structure that leads to governance difficulty, partly due to a doctrinaire implementation of the principle of ""small government, big market,"" or laisser faire, and most importantly due to the opposition's ""say no for none's sake"" that stirs political confrontation and sends Hong Kong into a dilemma of discussions without decisions, or making decisions without execution.
Over the past 22 years, the successive HKSAR governments have tried many times to tackle these problems by rolling out affordable housing programs and narrowing the rich-poor gap.
For example, to make houses more affordable, Tung Chee-hwa, the first HKSAR chief executive, proposed in 1997 to build at least 85,000 flats every year in the public and private sectors, raise the homeownership rate to 70 percent in 10 years and reduce the average waiting time for public rental housing to three years.
Such plans, however, went aborted as home prices plunged in Hong Kong amid the Asian financial crisis in 1998.
""Since Hong Kong's return, many economic and livelihood issues would not be as politicized as they are now, should the HKSAR government have introduced more policies and better social security arrangements to address those problems,"" said Tian Feilong, a law expert of the ""one country, two systems"" center with the Beijing-based Beihang University.
To carry out major policies or push forward major bills, the HKSAR government needs to garner the support of two-thirds majority at the Legislative Council (LegCo).
The HKSAR government's previous motions, be it economic policies or fiscal appropriations, were impeded by the opposition time and again at the LegCo, regardless of the interests of the majority of Hong Kong residents and the long-term development of the society.
The HKSAR government sought in 2012 to establish the Innovation and Technology Bureau to ride the global wave of innovative startups, diversify its economic structure and bring more opportunities for young people. Such efforts, however, were obstructed by the opposition at the LegCo in defiance of repeated calls by the public. After three years, the proposal to create the bureau was finally passed by the LegCo.
In another case, a Hong Kong resident, incited by the opposition, appealed in 2010 for a judicial review of the construction plan of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. Though the HKSAR government won the lawsuit after more than a year of court proceedings, 6.5 billion HK dollars of taxpayers' money had been wasted in the increased construction costs of the bridge's Hong Kong section due to the delay.
As time passed, problems remained unsolved, so did public discontent.
Repeated political bickering stalled Hong Kong's social progress amid the sparring, and the opposition created a false target and blamed the Chinese mainland for those deep-seated problems.
Lau Pui-King, an economist in Hong Kong, snubbed the opposition's resistance of or even antagonism to the Chinese mainland, saying such thinking of secluding Hong Kong from the entire country could end nowhere but push the city down an abyss.
""Seclusion brings no development opportunity for Hong Kong,"" Lau said. ""Some youngsters don't understand that Hong Kong would be even worse if it is secluded from the Chinese mainland.""
""To come out of the current economic difficulty, Hong Kong needs to be linked with the Chinese mainland much closer and more effectively,"" she said."

"Feature: Thousands of overseas Chinese, students in London chorus ""Save Hong Kong"" from violence","by Liang Xizhi, Gui Tao
LONDON, Aug. 19 (Xinhua) -- It was raining heavily in London on Sunday noon, yet for thousands of overseas Chinese and Chinese students attending a rally to voice out their demand for peace and stability in Hong Kong, such bad weather would never sink their passions.
Waving the Chinese national flag and the flag of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the crowd, chorusing the Chinese national anthem along the way from Chinatown to Trafalgar Square, expressed their firm objection to violence and strong support for the HKSAR government and Hong Kong police.
""I love Hong Kong, I love China,"" ""One China,"" chanted the crowd in Mandarin, Cantonese and English while holding placards written with slogans including ""Stop Violence"" and ""Save Hong Kong.""
The weather cleared when participants of the peaceful rally, young and old, arrived at Trafalgar Square. They sang ""I Love You, China,"" ""My Chinese Heart"" and ""Pearl of the Orient"" among many other Chinese songs to show their backing for solidarity and unity.
""We want to take today's opportunity to express our dissatisfaction with 'Hong Kong independence' and violence,"" said Zhang Yanqian, a student from Kingston University who participated in the rally.
""We speak the same language and keep the same blood. We should unite and make the motherland prosperous and strong,"" he said, voicing their hope to show their patriotism through the rally.
Zhang Feng, chairman of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association UK (CSSAUK), said the association ""strongly supports the HKSAR government and police and firmly supports the one-China policy.""
The CSSAUK has called on Chinese students studying in Britain to remain restraint, calm, and rationally patriotic on the premise of ensuring their own safety, Zhang said.
The rally, co-hosted by the London Chinatown Chinese Association, the Hong Kong New Territories Heung Yee Kuk Overseas Liaison Office and more than 100 overseas Chinese communities in Britain, lasted for about an hour.
The rally was to refute the lies of the ""Hong Kong independence"" organizations, to tell the outside world that Hong Kong is a democratic and free society, to express support for the HKSAR government, and to oppose the violent protests over the past two months, said Chu Ting Tang, chairman of the London Chinatown Chinese Association.
For overseas Chinese Seuisang Gong, Sunday's rally was a good chance to show his support for the HKSAR government and Hong Kong police to investigate the criminal responsibility of the rioters.
The HKSAR government and Hong Kong police should ""unite and work together"" to ""implement the law and deal with all illegal things in accordance with the law,"" Gong said.
""I hope that the riots will be settled as soon as possible and these mobs will be brought to justice. We hope that the government can restore Hong Kong's social order as soon as possible and make people's livelihood more peaceful. I believe this is the most important thing,"" Gong said."
Over 400 students arrested as Hong Kong police warn against impetuous crimes,"HONG KONG, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong police said Friday that 464 students were among those who have been arrested since the outbreak of protests and violence in early June.

"Hong Kong court bans doxxing of police officers, families","HONG KONG, Oct. 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's high court on Friday issued an interim injunction against malicious release of personal details that targets police officers and their families.
Effective till Nov. 8, the ban was aimed at preventing publication of their personal information, including names, posts, photos and addresses. Intimidation and harassment were also prohibited.
The police have become the major target of rampant cyber manhunt and even physical assaults amid the continued social unrest.
Besides attacking police officers at protest sites, mobsters repeatedly committed harassment around the living quarters of police officers in different areas of Hong Kong. There have also been media reports that spouses of officers were vocally abused and their children bullied.
Thousands of police officers and their families have fell victim to the doxxing.
Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Carrie Lam has said the government will review the existing laws and strengthen measures to address the problem."
"Roundup: Overseas experts voice support for China's stance on HK issue, urge end to chaos","BEIJING, Nov. 16 (Xinhua) -- Overseas experts and scholars voiced their firm support for the Chinese government's stance on the Hong Kong situation, expressing the hope that violence could be stopped quickly and stability could return to the city as early as possible.
While attending the 11th BRICS summit in the Brazilian capital of Brasilia on Thursday, Chinese President Xi Jinping voiced the Chinese government's stance on Hong Kong's situation, saying that the most pressing task for Hong Kong at present is to bring violence and chaos to an end and restore order.
Anatoly Tozik, former Belarusian ambassador to China, said he absolutely supports China's stance on the Hong Kong issue.
What violent criminals did in Hong Kong has gone far beyond normal demonstrations and laws, Tozik said, noting that current protests and activities in the city have shown a sign of extremism and terrorism, and can not be allowed to continue.
Tozik, who is also chairman of the Belarus-China Friendship Society, noted that Hong Kong is China's territory and the Hong Kong issue is an internal affair of China. Any external interference on the issue could not be allowed, he added.
Adhere Cavince, a Kenyan expert on international relations, said the continuous violence and criminal acts in Hong Kong caused severe damage to the city's stability and prosperity.
The disorder has troubled Hong Kong and if the violence goes on, it will further undermine Hong Kong's economy, and then, destroy people's livelihood, Cavince said.
In the eyes of Edwin Sakala, a political expert from Zambia, what is going on in Hong Kong is unacceptable and must be put to an end.
""What is happening in Hong Kong is a gross abuse of democracy,"" Sakala said, adding that there was no way the illegal protests could be allowed to go on at the expense of development.
Commenting on Xi's latest remarks on the Hong Kong situation, Avtandil Otinashvili, chief editor of Georgia's Newsday website, said Xi's words pointed out a clear way to restore order in Hong Kong.
The continuous violent activities in Hong Kong have trampled the rule of law and social order, and will harm the fundamental interests of the Hong Kong citizens, he said.
The chief editor called for efforts to end the expanding violent and criminal acts and bring the offenders to justice, so as to restore social order in Hong Kong."
Hong Kong court grants interim injunction over online information inciting violence,"HONG KONG, Oct. 31 (Xinhua) -- The High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) granted an interim injunction on Thursday to restrain people from disseminating online information that encourages violence, the HKSAR government's Department of Justice said.
A spokesman for the Department of Justice said the Secretary for Justice as guardian of the public interest applied to the court on Thursday for an ex parte injunction to restrain acts concerning abusive use of internet-based platform or medium.
These acts include willfully disseminating, circulating, publishing or re-publishing on any internet-based platform or medium (including but not limited to LIHKG and Telegram) any material or information that promotes, encourages or incites the use or threat of violence, intended or likely to cause bodily injury to any person unlawfully within Hong Kong, or damage to any property unlawfully within Hong Kong.
The injunction also restrains persons from assisting, causing, counselling, procuring, instigating, inciting, aiding, abetting or authorizing others to commit any of the aforesaid acts or participate in any of the aforesaid acts.
Since June, there have been numerous instances of violent protests and vandalizing acts in many districts of Hong Kong including but not limited to criminal damage to property, assaults of the person, riots and arson. 
The use of internet-based platform or medium, given its anonymous and instantaneous nature in communication as well as accessibility, have been abused by some to incite protesters to participate in unlawful activities, to promote the use of weapons and mobilize protesters to damage targeted properties and injure targeted individuals, in particular police officers, the spokesman pointed out.
Such acts have seriously breached public peace, and posed a grave and genuine danger to the police and members of the public, he added.
The interim injunction will remain in force till Nov. 15, 2019, according to the spokesman."
"HKSAR chief executive says to enhance measures against doxxing, bullying of police","HONG KONG, Oct. 17 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam said on Thursday that the HKSAR government will review the existing laws and strengthen measures against online doxxing and bullying of police officers.
The police have made great efforts over the past four months, and the policy address delivered Wednesday by the chief executive has expressed gratitude and reiterated support to the police in law enforcement, Lam said at a Question and Answer Session at the Legislative Council (LegCo) on the 2019 policy address.
Different departments of the HKSAR government have been coordinated to extend support to the police from various directions, and she has also met with representatives of the police staff associations to listen to their views and discuss how to enhance support for the police, the chief executive said.
To tackle the online bullying of police officers, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data has followed up, and the HKSAR government will also examine existing laws so as to better cope with large-scale online doxxing and bullying, Lam said.
The police have become a major target of attacks by rioters in the months-long unrest in Hong Kong. Besides violently assaulting police officers at protest sites, mobsters repeatedly committed harassment around the living quarters of police officers in different areas of Hong Kong.
The HKSAR High Court has approved earlier this week the police's application for an injunction order to curb escalating violence and harassment against the living quarters of the police officers.
Reiterating that the key to quelling the current chaos is to uphold Hong Kong's core value of rule of law, Lam appealed to the public to draw a clear line with violence.
Lam delivered the 2019 policy address via video on Wednesday, with over 220 initiatives designed to solve Hong Kong's deep-seated social problems and improve people's livelihood."

""Such despicable acts are unacceptable in any country or civilized society,"" the principal official said, urging the British government and police to discharge their duties and hold the criminals accountable.
The principal official pointed out that ""what has happened has shown it more clearly that the rioters in Hong Kong are by no means having peaceful protests, but are committing extremist violent crime of threatening and depriving others of democracy, human rights, freedoms and safety.""
""They have tested the limits of human morals and frantically defied the law,"" the principal official said, adding that ""violent crime is not only a virus detrimental to Hong Kong but also a common enemy to humanity.""

The principal official emphasized that the rioters are gripped by ""doomsday craze"" in their savage acts.
The Chinese government is rock-firm in safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests, in implementing the policy of one country, two systems, and in opposing any foreign interference in Hong Kong affairs, the principal official said.
The principal official said that ""We will continue to firmly support Chief Executive in leading the SAR government to govern in accordance with the law, the Hong Kong police in strictly enforcing the law, and the Hong Kong judiciary in putting the violent criminals to justice.""

"2nd LD-Writethru: HK people urged to stop violence and chaos, bring back order","BEIJING, Aug. 6 (Xinhua) -- A spokesperson on Tuesday urged people in Hong Kong to stop the violence and chaos and bring back order.
It is the immediate task facing all Hong Kong residents, which is very clear given the severe state of affairs in the region today, said Yang Guang, spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, at a press conference.
Yang called on people in Hong Kong to stand firm and guard their beautiful homeland, stressing that now is the crucial moment.
""Here we sincerely hope the compatriots in Hong Kong will think calmly about the questions: Who will suffer if the situation becomes irremediable, and who will benefit in the end?""
All departments and organs of Hong Kong should never be soft on violent violations of the law, Yang stressed.
Reiterating the central government's unswerving support for Chief Executive Carrie Lam, the spokesperson said the opposition's attempt to force her to resign is doomed to fail.
""We hope that the people of Hong Kong understand the nature of the current situation and firmly support Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam in leading the HKSAR government's law-based governance, the Hong Kong police in enforcing laws rigorously and departments of the HKSAR government and the judiciary body in punishing violent criminals in accordance with the law,"" Yang said.
He then made it clear to ""the very small group of unscrupulous and violent criminals and the dirty forces behind them"" that those who play with fire will perish by it, and that whoever participates in violent and criminal activities would be held accountable according to the law.
""All in all, the fate of Hong Kong will be decided by all Chinese people including Hong Kong compatriots,"" Yang added.
Xu Luying, also a spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said the violence and conflict that transpired recently in Hong Kong were, in essence, manipulated behind the scenes by elements who aim to destabilize and damage Hong Kong.
They use young people as the ""chess pieces"" and ""cannon fodder"" for their political schemes, Xu said, noting that more and more young people will see their true colors, realize the errors and turn back from the wrong path.
Acknowledging that young people in Hong Kong do face many difficulties growing up, Xu said that these can not be resolved through violence or law-breaking.
""We advise those young people who have participated in the protests or even some violent conflicts to stop and return to the correct path of law and order,"" Xu said.
Yang said that the deteriorating situation in Hong Kong is linked to the irresponsible remarks concocted by some western politicians.
""Hong Kong is part of China. Interference into the Hong Kong affairs by any foreign countries should not be allowed,"" he said."
1st LD-Writethru: China condemns U.S. House approval of bill on Hong Kong,"BEIJING, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- A spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council on Wednesday made serious protest to and strongly condemned the passing of the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 by the U.S. House of Representatives.
The U.S. House of Representatives passed the act, proposed by some congressmen, on Tuesday local time despite strong opposition from the Chinese government.
Yang Guang, the spokesperson, said the move was a gross intervention in China's internal affairs, a blatant backing for the Hong Kong opposition and violent radicals, and a full revelation of the U.S. House of Representatives' and some politicians' political calculations, who attempt to contain the development of China through playing ""Hong Kong card.""
The disturbance, originated from proposed ordinance amendments, has become ever more violent. It is inescapably related to the overt or covert support from the U.S. side to anti-China troublemakers in Hong Kong, Yang said.
He noted that some violent radicals have been wantonly beating, smashing, looting, causing serious obstruction to the traffic, and vandalizing public facilities.
""They hurled petrol bombs upon subway in operation and produced remote-control homemade bombs,"" Yang said, adding that they also assaulted police officers and ordinary residents with different opinions, as well as snatched police guns and even slashed at an officer's neck.
Yang said their actions severely harmed the public order and infringed upon the basic human rights of Hong Kong people including police, such as personal safety and freedom of expression.
U.S. House and some politicians turned a blind eye to violent crimes of Hong Kong mobs, confused right and wrong and confounded black with white, Yang said. ""It is nothing else but being accessary to crimes and should definitely be blamed.""
Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the policies of ""one country, two systems,"" ""the people of Hong Kong governing Hong Kong"" and a high degree of autonomy for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have been faithfully implemented, and the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents have been fully protected in accordance with the law, Yang noted.
""We advise the U.S. Congress and some politicians to respect facts and immediately cease the subsequent review of the act to avoid heaped error on error,"" said Yang. ""Hong Kong would be more prosperous and stable without U.S. interference."""

 STABILITY URGED
Recent unrest has severely impacted Hong Kong's economy, and the exhibition industry has not been spared. However, this year's summit struck a strong note with more participants and longer duration than the previous year.
Many attendees voiced their concern about the violence in Hong Kong.
""No one can condone violence,"" said Will Myles, global director of RICS, a professional body for qualifications and standards. He has lived and worked in Hong Kong for many years, believing that it needs time and dialogues to solve social problems.

With support of China's central government and hard efforts made by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government, the SAR will go through these challenging times, Jalili said.
""At first, we worried that the protest may actually affect the summit,"" Phumzile Sibisi, deputy head of customer & retail services of Ethekwini Municipality, said. ""I think the government has done a great job, and hopefully they will be able to address the unrest.""
 BIGGER ROLE
Carrie Lam, chief executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), said at the opening session that Hong Kong is well positioned to serve as the gateway to the Belt and Road and its manifold prospects and possibilities, with opportunities in capacity building, green finance, professional services and business matching.
Infrastructure is a cornerstone of the Belt and Road Initiative. Its funding needs in Asia will be 1.7 trillion U.S. dollars each year on average through 2030, according to the Asian Development Bank.
""Our deep liquidity, outstanding financial infrastructure and wide-ranging options for raising capital...can meet the financing needs of any Belt and Road project,"" Paul Chan, financial secretary of the HKSAR government, said.
Chan stressed that Hong Kong arranged and issued 11 billion U.S. dollars worth of green bonds last year, tripling that of 2017.
Experts said that Hong Kong's high standard professional services can provide strong support for a wide range of projects of the Belt and Road Initiative. The city boasts world-class talent in finance, accounting, insurance, risk management, law and dispute resolution.
""Hong Kong remains and will continue to play a unique role in China's continuing development and in the Belt and Road Initiative,"" Victor Chu, chairman of First Eastern Investment Group, said.
Thanks to Hong Kong's favorable conditions, Chu's group has invested over 200 projects in 55 cities in the Chinese mainland, as well as quite a few energy efficiency projects in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region.
 SHARED BY WORLD
From government officials to enterprises and institutions, the development opportunities created by the Belt and Road Initiative have been increasingly recognized globally.
It was the second straight year for the Economic Development Board of Mauritius to participate in the forum. In last year's event, it successfully signed an agreement with a Chinese company to set up regional headquarters in Mauritius to explore the African market.
""In the Belt and Road, Mauritius has a very favorable location that only takes several hours of flight to reach African countries, India or Australia,"" Hans Seesaghur, China desk officer of the Economic Development Board of Mauritius, said.
Seesaghur said that he hopes more enterprises learn about Mauritius' good investment environment and rich financial services at this year's summit.
Like Seesaghur, Boris Tkatchenko, project manager of Greater Paris Investment Agency, also looked for new Belt and Road investment opportunities at the summit, for the latest infrastructure project in Paris and surrounding areas.
The project will add 200 km of new railway lines that more efficiently link Paris with surrounding places that feature high techs, bio-techs, sustainable city, and digital and creative industry, with 2 million passengers every day.
""We are looking for private investors for following investment expected at 100 billion euros that will reinvent areas surrounding those new stations,"" Tkatchenko said.
The Greater Paris project will be greatly benefited, if becoming part of the Belt and Road Initiative, he said."
Interview: Education should be emphasized to let HK youth learn more about history: Thai scholar,"BANGKOK, Sept. 5 (Xinhua) -- Some Hong Kong young people should learn more about the history of Hong Kong as well as China to get rid of illusions about the West, Thai scholar Anek Laothamatas said.
""I think many protesters forgot the history that Hong Kong was taken from China by the British empire by force,"" Anek said in a pool interview with Chinese media recently.
The British empire sold opium to poison Chinese to get benefit and then China fought back, rightfully, by confiscating and destroying the opium supplies in the early 19th century, which was answered by British gunboats, he said, adding that some Americans also joined the opium trade to China as well.
China, very weak at that time, was defeated and signed the Treaty of Nanking, which forced China to cede the Hong Kong Island to the British, followed by Kowloon after the Second Opium War in 1856.
The British empire also sought to expand their colony by forcing China to ""lease"" the New Territories, he noted.
The colonization of Hong Kong was a humiliation to China, which shows the weakness of the country with a long history at that time, he said.
""I still remembered the scene when Hong Kong returned to China in 1997, the Union Jack came down and the Five-starred Red Flag went up, I was excited then as it was very difficult to achieve the peaceful handover,"" Anek said.
He criticized some radical protesters for holding the national flags of the United Kingdom and the United States during those protests, pointing out that ""they have no sense of responsibility.""
""Hong Kong is part of China,"" he said. ""It seems they have forgotten the humiliation of being colonized and those bad things that Western colonizers had done to the Chinese people.""
Recently, Anek also posted an article in Thai on Facebook to explain the situation in Hong Kong to Thais.
Titled ""Hong Kong: past, present and future,"" he wrote in the article that the British colonizers, who always advocate respecting human rights, only wanted profits when they shamelessly smuggled opium to China and chose to be blind to the great harm that opium had done to Chinese people.
Anek suggested that education should be emphasized to let the Hong Kong youth learn more about Hong Kong's history to get rid of the illusion among some of them about the West.
The Thai scholar also added during the interview that some radical protesters in the past two months tried to anger the Hong Kong police on purpose to make the situation worse.
Describing these radical protesters as ill-intentioned who wanted to make it a ""color revolution"" to ask for support from the West, he said ""that could never be successful.""
The Thai scholar also criticized some media that see China in a Cold War mindset as they ignored that China is now a very pragmatic country and a upholder of free trade and globalization.
He spoke highly of China's ""one country, two systems"" principle.
Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong kept thriving, he said, the special administrative region developed in a faster speed than it was under the British rule, ""so I can say 'one country, two systems' is successful.""
Anek said both in his article and in his interview with the Chinese media that Hong Kong is a wonderful place for shopping and tourism in Thai people's eyes and he hoped the chaos and disturbances could end soon in Hong Kong."
"Xinhua Headlines: New semester starts in Hong Kong, violence deplored","HONG KONG, Sept. 2 (Xinhua) -- School principal Wong Kam-Leung spread a message of peace, hard work and loving one's own country as he made his first-day-of-school speech.
On Monday, 800 students and teachers gathered for a national flag-raising ceremony at a spacious hall of Wong Cho Bau School in the New Territories. Flag-raising at the beginning of a school year is its tradition.
""It saddens me to see all the controversy and disturbances in Hong Kong over the summer. Those young people who threw a national flag into the sea must have very low respect for the flag and the country. Today's ceremony is significant. It teaches students to respect the country,"" he told a roomful of attendees.
""We can only have a safe home and a nice place to study when we have a strong nation at our back. For Hong Kong to develop, it must integrate into the overall picture of the Chinese nation, and that is the way for young people in Hong Kong to find success in the future,"" he said.
As students return to school, a handful of violent demonstrators disrupted the morning public commuting by blocking train doors.
To avoid possible disturbances by riots, teachers arrived at the school early on Monday morning, said Sharon Yau, one of the 60 teachers at the school.
""I can't help worrying about not being able to get to work, a traffic jam or a station shut down due to the protests. Demands should be expressed in a sensible manner, instead of disrupting people's lives and causing fear,"" she said.
A team of 19 young flag guards in white uniforms marched in the ceremony, while their classmates watched respectfully. All stood at attention as the flag was hoisted.
""I'm nervous but very excited. We practiced a lot to make sure we march at the same pace. This is a huge honor for me,"" said 9-year-old April Lam, who joined the flag guard team five months ago.
Hong Kong has more than 1,000 kindergartens, 587 elementary schools, 506 secondary schools, and 22 institutions that confer higher education degrees. Classes began on Monday without disturbances, despite boycott calls from the opposition. Kindergartens canceled classes due to torrential downpours.
On Monday, yellow school buses were visible on the streets. Most schools in Hong Kong were generally normal on the first school day, and the traffic was smooth, said Kevin Yeung Yun-hung, secretary for education of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government. 
""In the past few weeks, we have been liaisoning and discussing with different stakeholders in the sector to ensure normal school operation as far as possible. Of course, we need to monitor the situation closely, and we are prepared to provide support to schools if necessary,"" Yeung said.
""I think it's a common value in the society and also among the education sector that schools should not be used as places to make political demands or to put pressure on the government for political needs,"" Yeung added.
RESTORING ORDER AT SCHOOLS
Long before the new academic year kicked off on Monday, concerns had been mounting about possible campus bullying, especially those targeting children of police officers.
The personal data of at least 1,662 police officers and their families have been illegally disclosed online since June, including pictures of the children of the police and information about their schools and classes.
In some cases, teachers reportedly encouraged bullying against children of the police. In response, Yeung issued a stern warning that the schools concerned must ""take disciplinary action"" and the education bureau will impose punishment accordingly, including considering whether they are still qualified to be an educator.
In the face of cyberbullying and threats of attacks against children of the police, personal alarm devices were offered to police with children under the age of 18, according to media reports.
According to the police, 117 liaison officers keep in contact with primary and secondary schools to offer assistance if necessary.
The unrest since early June has already had a negative impact on some middle school students, sending an alarm to teachers, parents, and civil groups. Two petrol bombs were found among the belongings of a 13-year-old suspect detained recently.
In an open letter to all elementary and middle schools in Hong Kong, a civil group named Safeguard Hong Kong warned of possible class boycotts and campus bullying and called for efforts to bring the ""nature of education"" back to schools.
CALLS TO END CHAOS
The prolonged protests and violence have drawn ire among the public. On Monday, a handful of violent demonstrators disrupted morning commuting by blocking train doors. Hong Kong opposition also bewitched students to boycott classes to keep tensions high.
Denouncing the new wave of disruptive and even dangerous behaviors, many people are appealing for peace and rational thinking.
Before the new semester began, Margaret Chan, former director-general of the World Health Organization, called on students not to skip classes amid the current chaos and refrain from violent protests.
""School years are the most beautiful and precious time in one's life,"" Chan, who is also a mother, said in a statement to students. ""Cherish your time, get yourselves prepared for a beautiful future.""
The current situation also left Yu Kwok-chun, vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, in distress, particularly when he saw teenagers and students being instigated into violent acts.
""I hope students can calm down and return to campus for the new semester,"" Yu said.
Yu's concerns were echoed by Lam Suk-yee, former president of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions.
""The unrest has brought mayhem to Hong Kong's economy and public security, and greatly damaged infrastructure facilities,"" Lam said. ""Such acts are harming others and not benefiting society. Our residents have had enough.""
She hoped all students and workers, white- or blue-collar, can stick to their posts amid efforts to stop violence, end the chaos, restore order and rebuild a prosperous and stable Hong Kong."
2nd LD-Writethru: China condemns U.S. House approval of bill on Hong Kong,"BEIJING, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- A spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council on Wednesday made serious protest to and strongly condemned the passing of the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 by the U.S. House of Representatives.
The U.S. House of Representatives passed the act, proposed by some congressmen, on Tuesday local time despite strong opposition from the Chinese government.
Yang Guang, the spokesperson, said the move was a gross intervention in China's internal affairs, a blatant backing for the Hong Kong opposition and violent radicals, and a full revelation of the U.S. House of Representatives' and some politicians' political calculations, who attempt to contain the development of China through playing ""Hong Kong card.""
The disturbance, originated from proposed ordinance amendments, has become ever more violent. It is inescapably related to the overt or covert support from the U.S. side to anti-China troublemakers in Hong Kong, Yang said.
He noted that some violent radicals have been wantonly beating, smashing, looting, causing serious obstruction to the traffic, and vandalizing public facilities.
""They hurled petrol bombs upon subway in operation and produced remote-control homemade bombs,"" Yang said, adding that they also assaulted police officers and ordinary residents with different opinions, as well as snatched police guns and even slashed at an officer's neck.
Yang said their actions severely harmed the public order and infringed upon the basic human rights of Hong Kong people including police, such as personal safety and freedom of expression.
U.S. House and some politicians turned a blind eye to violent crimes of Hong Kong mobs, confused right and wrong and confounded black with white, Yang said. ""It is nothing else but being accessary to crimes and should definitely be blamed.""
Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the policies of ""one country, two systems,"" ""the people of Hong Kong governing Hong Kong"" and a high degree of autonomy for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have been faithfully implemented, and the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents have been fully protected in accordance with the law, Yang noted.
""We advise the U.S. Congress and some politicians to respect facts and immediately cease the subsequent review of the act to avoid heaped error on error,"" said Yang. ""Hong Kong would be more prosperous and stable without U.S. interference."""
"HKSAR gov't says protests beyond rational limit, not to condone illegal acts","HONG KONG, Aug. 4 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government said on Sunday that recent protests in Hong Kong have gone far beyond the limits of peaceful and rational protests for which the HKSAR government and general public will not condone under any circumstances.
In response to the deteriorating situation of recent protests, the spokesman said in a statement that ""blatant violation of law, wanton destruction of public peace and violent attacks on the Police will harm Hong Kong's society, economy and our people's livelihood.""
The spokesman said that recent protests which were organized in the name of expressing demands have intensified illegal and road-blocking acts.
""Protesters maliciously committed serious unlawful acts including making violent attacks in different districts, assaulting police officers and committing arson. Protesters further blocked both ways of the tunnel tubes of Hong Hom Cross Harbour Tunnel as well as major trunk roads such as Lung Cheung Road yesterday and early this morning, causing serious adverse impacts on the public,"" he said.
As for some protesters who are instigating the public to participate in strikes and blocking roads and public transport on Monday, the HKSAR government hoped that while expressing their demands, protesters should abide by the law and respect the rights of other members of the public, the spokesman said.
The HKSAR government also calls on the general public to ""stand fast at their posts and cherish Hong Kong's hard-earned international financial centre status, stable economic base and a diverse and inclusive social environment.""
Hong Kong's economy is suffering from both external headwinds and local social issues. The latest economic data, which is the worst over the past decade, shows that the economy is weakening and the risk of an economic downturn is increasing, according to the spokesman.
""Any large-scale strikes and acts of violence will affect the livelihood and economic activities of Hong Kong citizens. This will only undermine further the local economy that is facing downside risks, as well as the confidence of the international community and overseas investors in Hong Kong's society and economy, causing loss and damages to law and order, economy, people's livelihood, employment and eventually to the detriment of all quarters of society,"" the spokesman added.
The HKSAR government reiterated that the entire civil service has to stay united amid all the pressure and challenges.
""This is a difficult moment and government colleagues must act in the overall interest of Hong Kong and work together to uphold the core values of the civil service,"" said the spokesman. ""The effective operation of the Government and provision of public services must not be affected by any personal beliefs in order to avoid undermining public confidence in the impartial discharge of duties by civil servants."""

"Cathay Pacific reiterates ""zero-tolerance"" to employees' support for illegal protests","HONG KONG, Aug. 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways on Saturday reiterated in a statement to its employees that there is zero-tolerance to any support for or participation in illegal protests, violent activities or overly radical behaviour.

Cathay Pacific said the injunction granted to the Airport Authority of Hong Kong also covers its headquarters.

"1st LD: Rioters start arson, hurl petrol bombs in renewed violence in Hong Kong","HONG KONG, Sept. 15 (Xinhua) -- Rioters set fires to subway station exits, threw petrol bombs, beat innocent residents and blocked roads to inflict violence in Hong Kong again on Sunday, as prolonged unrest continues to roil the place.
An illegal rally on the Hong Kong Island turned violent again on Sunday afternoon, as rioters began throwing petrol bombs at the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government offices and in areas around the Legislative Council (LegCo) buildings at about 4:30 p.m. local time and vandalized mass transit railway (MTR) stations.
Before the violence erupted, radical protesters blocked several main roads in Central, Admiralty and Wan Chai areas, seriously obstructing road traffic on the Hong Kong Island.
The MTR stations at Admiralty and Wan Chai were forced to close after rioters smashed the glass inside, damaged and obstructed MTR exits in escalating violence.
As repeated warnings to protesters who posed a serious threat to police officers and the public turned futile, the Hong Kong police deployed tear gas and specialized crowd management vehicles in dispersal operations in the Central and Admiralty areas.
TV footage showed that some radical protesters set fires to the Chinese national flag and a banner marking the founding of the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.
A blue-clad innocent resident was beaten and kicked by a mob in Admiralty area before falling into a coma, according to TV footage. His face and back were in heavy bruises.
As of 6:00 pm, one person was injured in Sunday's public event on the Hong Kong Island. A 49-year-old man was admitted to Ruttonjee Hospital and was in critical condition, according to the Hong Kong Hospital Authority.
The LegCo Secretariat issued a red alert Sunday afternoon and required all persons to evacuate the LegCo Complex immediately.
A number of stores in the once busy shopping areas in Causeway Bay, Wan Chai and Admiralty were forced to shut down Sunday afternoon.
The police said the radical protesters were participating in an unauthorized assembly and their acts seriously threatened the safety of all the people at scene, warning them to stop their illegal acts immediately.
Since June, Hong Kong has suffered from escalating violence that originated from protests over proposed ordinance amendments concerning fugitive offenders. Prolonged unrest has hit the city's economy, and divided friends, colleagues and even families.
Unprecedented scenes of violence has been playing out in Hong Kong over the past months. Vandalism of metro stations, setting fires on streets and attacking police with petrol bombs and bricks have become common occurrences."
Former NYPD officer said police should never be treated as enemies,"NEW YORK, Aug. 20 (Xinhua) -- The police, a symbol of law, are the defenders of our society, and should never be treated as enemies, said Hugh H. Mo, a former deputy police commissioner of New York City Police Department (NYPD), in a Tuesday interview with Xinhua.
Talking about the protests in Hong Kong, Mo said the situation is very peculiar for police forces in this Chinese port city, when friendly ties between the police and civilians seem to come to an unexpected challenge.
""Here in New York (city), the right to protest is respected as long as it is carried out in line with laws, but once you don't cooperate with the police in demonstration, you are taking risks of committing crimes and being punished by law,"" Mo said.
""Whenever you see an NYPD vehicle on the street, you can't fail to see the three words on the body -- Courtesy, Professionalism, and Respect, which serve as a reminder for both the police and the public, to respect each other, and defend the dignity of law,"" he said.
When facing assaults, U.S. police have the right to use their weapons to counter life threats from anyone who is armed in any form, or call other team members to reinforce them in containing the situation, the former police officer said.
During the Occupy Wall Street movement back in 2011, Mo said that anti-riot squads, riot cars, snipers and mounted units were called from eight towns to help New York City deal with the situation. Equipment such as stun batons and tear gas were used in controlling the situation amid protests, and nearly 1,000 people were arrested in two weeks.
The former NYPD officer said that he would like to see the rule of law restored in Hong Kong, a society long famous for its prosperity, good governance and friendliness."
"1st LD Writethru: Leaders of political groups advocating ""independence"" taken to court: police","HONG KONG, Aug. 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police have confirmed that Joshua Wong Chi-fung and Agnes Chow Ting, leaders of Demosisto advocating ""Hong Kong's independence,"" were taken to court Friday.
Tse Chun-chung, chief superintendent of police public relations branch, said that at a daily press conference Friday.
Wong was arrested on Friday morning on charges of ""inciting others to participate in unauthorized gatherings,"" ""organizing unauthorized gatherings"" and ""knowingly participating in unauthorized gatherings.""
Chow was arrested on charges of ""inciting others to participate in unauthorized gatherings"" and ""knowingly participating in unauthorized gatherings.""
According to the press conference, the police also on Thursday evening detained Andy Chan Ho-tin on charges of rioting and assaulting a police officer. Chan was the leader of Hong Kong National Party, a political group that has been announced illegal by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government.
Tse said the police have been investigating offenses in protests over the past two months and have made seven new arrests since Thursday evening, with suspects involved in the besiegement of the Hong Kong Legislative Council and Police headquarters, or other violent incidents.
""We take a zero-tolerance approach to all violent incidents and all arrests were made based on enough evidence,"" Tse said.
As violence has intensified, the police have become one of the targets of violent demonstrators as 20 police stations and 131 police vehicles have been damaged by them to varied extent as far, Tse said.
With a large proportion of forces deployed to handle violent incidents, Hong Kong police were short of officers to respond to regular emergency calls.
Tse said 324, 220, 180 cases in August, July and June respectively, although still a small share of all, exceeded the response time limit as promised by Hong Kong police, which are nine minutes in Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, and 15 minutes in New Territories.
The cases with longer response time were mainly on weekends, Tse added."
"Interview: Violence in Hong Kong won't be allowed by ""any country in the world"": veteran Serbian politician","BELGRADE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Violence happening during protests in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) shall not be allowed anywhere around the globe, and those behind the riots are actually speculating on a ""weak and divided China,"" said the general secretary of the Serbian People's Party.
Jovan Palalic, who is also a member of the Serbian Parliament, told Xinhua in a recent interview that the ongoing protests in Hong Kong ""essentially aimed to prevent China from establishing its power throughout the state territory."" 
He said that he understands Hong Kong people's difference in opinion, but the radicals' option for violence is not acceptable.
""If one looks at the position of Hong Kong and its citizens within the unified China, here exist all human and democratic rights to express every political stance,"" Palalic said.
The reasons why some people protest with violence are that they want to ""create a new internal tension and destabilization of China, with the aim of slowing down its economic growth and military and political power,"" according to the senior statesman.
""No state can accept that political violence is imposed in order to change the decisions of state organs. This is not allowed by any country in the world, so it is logical that China and the government of its part of Hong Kong does not support it..."" he added.
For weeks, radical protestors have staged a trail of violent incidents. Some of them unlawfully occupied the streets, attacked police officers, and stored illegal dangerous goods and offensive weapons. 
They stormed and damaged the Legislative Council Complex in the HKSAR and even besieged and stormed the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR on the evening of July 21, defacing the national emblem and painting insulting words on the wall.
The violent acts, in Palalic's words, aim to foster ""conflicts among Hong Kong citizens and incite dissatisfaction with the central government in Beijing,"" with an ultimate goal ""to weaken China and destroy its reputation...""
The Serbian party leader also refuted the interference of some external forces.
He said similar movements did happen to Serbia when the aim of the protests was to overthrow a government that certain Western powers did not like.
""Those who truly stand behind the protest, in truth only want to see a weak and divided China again,"" Palalic said, adding that there is no justification for such meddling into a sovereign country' internal affair.
He said each country must respect the principle of non-interference in internal issues of other countries, and to respect the political and economic system chosen by their people.
""This means that it is necessary to let state authorities of the People's Republic of China and the administration of Hong Kong (HKSAR) to resolve any issues that have to do with adoption and implementation of laws in Hong Kong, without any pressures, or campaigns directed towards undermining sovereignty or imposing political options through favoring political groups or individuals which are closer to their interests than interests of people of China and Hong Kong (HKSAR),"" he said.
Patience towards these phenomena should be demonstrated but ""no one should show weakness in the implementation of laws and government decisions,"" Palalic said.
""Those who lead these protests will not be able to realize their goals against the firm determination"" of HKSAR, he said. ""So, (act) patiently, wisely and resolutely."""
Spotlight: People from all walks of life in Hong Kong condemn violent acts of defacing national emblem,"HONG KONG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- People from all walks of life in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have condemned the violent acts by some radical protesters who insulted and defaced the national emblem days ago.
Jack Wong, a student from the City University of Hong Kong, said the violent and extreme acts did not come accidently but were maliciously planned.
""The political environment and public security in Hong Kong have been deteriorating these days, with some reckless students instigated to take part in violent activities,"" Wong said.
""But most students in Hong Kong have a cherished desire for a stable environment for living and learning.""
Wong called on those youth who love the motherland and Hong Kong to unite and express their ideas in a rational and peaceful way.
""The youth hold the future of Hong Kong. It is so sad that some young people in Hong Kong are embroiled in endless violence,"" Wong said.
Hazel Liu from independent media said some young people in Hong Kong have crossed the line in protests and some media should be blamed for it.
Acts of breaking the law and principle ""have been glorified"" by certain media which has fueled and escalated the violence in Hong Kong, with some protesters avowedly attacking the policemen on duty. It is a sickness of the society, Liu said.
""Storming the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, defacing the national emblem and painting words to insult the nation are all too sad and they should not have happened in Hong Kong,"" she said. ""We should condemn all the violent acts."" 
Young people in Hong Kong do not have enough understanding of their own living environment and the history of Hong Kong because the Chinese history is not a compulsory course in Hong Kong's middle school, according to Liu.
""If we do not want to let the history repeat itself, we should first have a clear understanding of the historical context,"" she added.
The recent extreme and violent acts have seriously undermined the foundation of the rule of law and the order of the society in Hong Kong, So Ka Lok, a community service worker said.
He expressed his strongest indignation at the defacing of the national emblem by the radicals.
""Their behaviors have trampled on national dignity and constituted a serious insult not only to the nearly 1.4 billion Chinese people, but also to those who have sacrificed their lives to defend the country and all overseas Chinese,"" he said.
He urged his fellow citizens to cherish the hard-won prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and not do anything detrimental to its stability and prosperity at the instigation of the external forces.
Cayden, a 30-year-old local citizen, and his friends also considered the behaviors of storming the liaison office building and defacing the national emblem as radical and unacceptable, noting that the central government has always cared for Hong Kong since it returned to the motherland.
The central government is the biggest support for Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, he said, adding ""if there's no such support, Hong Kong's economy will surely lose its shine.""
Tang, who was born and raised in Hong Kong's New Territories, said local residents have the tradition of loving the country, loving Hong Kong and loving their villages.
He said the acts of defacing the national emblem were unacceptable, and most Hong Kong people believed such acts have crossed the line.
The national emblem is sacred and inviolable, and the dignity of the country can never be desecrated, said another Hong Kong resident Alice Wong.
She said defacing the national emblem was absolutely unacceptable in the Hong Kong society, and many of her friends and colleagues were indignant at such acts.
These radical protesters have become rioters, who, if not brought to justice, would put the Hong Kong people and the law and order here at risk, she added."
Roundup: Analysts urge violence in Hong Kong to be stopped soon,"BEIJING, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- The blatant violence in Hong Kong, which has jeopardized the prosperity and stability of the special administrative region of China, should be stopped as soon as possible, analysts have said.
""It's just affecting the ordinary Hong Kong people's lives ... It's hurting stability, which is needed for development,"" Robert Kuhn, chairman of the Kuhn Foundation, told Xinhua in a recent interview.
Speaking of the unlawful assembly at the Hong Kong International Airport on Tuesday evening, Kuhn said it was ""very extreme"" and ""just unacceptable.""
""You can't have that. No country can allow that to continue to happen,"" Kuhn added.
Such violent acts have caused great harm to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, said Katalina Barreiro, vice president of Ecuador's Institute of Advanced National Studies.
Barreiro said she fully supports China's clear-cut safeguarding of national sovereignty.
China is totally capable of controlling the situation in Hong Kong and maintaining its national security and stability, she said.
The purpose of the ongoing violent protests is to stir up chaos and turmoil in Hong Kong, and is not a response to any particular draft or rule of law, Michael Borchmann, former director general of the International Affairs Department in Germany's Hesse State, wrote in an article published in European newspaper Nouvelles d'Europe.
It is in the best interests of Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland as a whole to put an end to the protests with determined actions, he wrote.
The prolonged violent protests have not only hindered Hong Kong's economic development and affected the lives of its people, but also undermined its international image, said Ignacio Martinez, head of the Trade, Economy and Business Analysis Laboratory at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.
Martinez urged Hong Kong people of all circles to find a proper solution to the problem, so as to avoid any further escalation of the situation.
""The radical protesters are not only endangering the lives of police officers, but also the lives of Hong Kong residents, as well as its prosperity and stability,"" said Iraqi political analyst Ibrahim al-Ameri.
""Now, everybody should know that violence is not a solution to social problems, and the most important thing now is to stop violence, end chaos and restore order,"" he said.
In the eyes of Stephen Ndegwa, a public policy lecturer at Kenya-based United States International University Africa, Hong Kong citizens would be the biggest victims of such escalating violence.
It has become quite urgent to stop the violence and investigate the criminal responsibility of the rioters, Ndegwa said.
It is worrying that certain external factors attempted to use Hong Kong to suppress China and provoke separatism in some parts of the Asian country, said Syrian political analyst Hussam Shuaib.
Any deterioration of the situation would not only jeopardize Hong Kong's development, but also affect other regions, he said.
""Hong Kong's affairs are part of the purely internal affairs of China. What happens in the administrative region will have consequences for China,"" said Hasan Al-Saouri, professor of political science at Sudan's Al Nelain University.
For Sudheendra Kulkarni, former chairman of Indian think tank Observer Research Foundation Mumbai, the future of Hong Kong relies on a stable political environment.
He said he hopes that those Hong Kong youth bewitched by outside forces could wake up as soon as possible.
Chu Ting Tang, chairman of the London Chinatown Chinese Association, described the current situation of Hong Kong as ""heartbreaking"" and ""very serious,"" and believed that continuous protests would be detrimental to Hong Kong's economy.
""I hope that the Hong Kong citizens will unite and oppose those ... rioters and those who want to ruin Hong Kong,"" he said."

Airport Authority Hong Kong obtains interim injunction to restrain interfering with proper use of airport,"HONG KONG, Aug. 14 (Xinhua) -- Airport Authority Hong Kong on Wednesday said that they have obtained an interim injunction to restrain persons from unlawfully and willfully obstructing or interfering with the proper use of Hong Kong International Airport.
The authority emphasized that persons are also restrained from attending or participating in any demonstration or protest or public order event in the airport other than in the area designated by the airport authority.

"Roundup: Experts rebuke external interference with, false reports about China's Hong Kong","BEIJING, Aug. 27 (Xinhua) -- Experts have rebuked some Western countries for meddling in China's internal affairs and stirring up tensions in Hong Kong, and called for a resolution of the violent street protests.
""What is happening now in Hong Kong is clearly blatant interventions by the United States and Britain aimed at creating certain problems,"" Kawa Mahmoud, secretary of Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kurdistan, told Xinhua recently.
Some in the West are trying to destabilize the situation in Hong Kong, ""fan flames,"" and ""use the young people in Hong Kong to raise the wave against China,"" said Alexei Maslov, head of the Oriental Studies Department of the Russian Higher School of Economics Research University, in a recent interview with Xinhua.
As the ongoing protests have ""completely lost rationality,"" the crisis could deal a great blow to the business circle in Hong Kong, making the place ""unstable in the financial and political sense,"" Maslov warned.
External intervention from the West has provoked storms of so-called ""pro-democracy"" protests in some countries but only left people there displaced and cities ruined, said Luxman Siriwardena, executive director of advocacy and research think-tank Pathfinder Foundation based in Sri Lanka.
He said ""my wish is that Hongkongers will see the reality before it's too late"" and called for a reasonable resolution through consultation and dialogue.
""I sincerely hope that Hongkongers will not stage a struggle which will lead to the drastic decline of their own living standards, opportunities and future of the youth,"" he added.
B. R. Deepak, professor at India's Jawaharlal Nehru University, said violent demonstrations are ""disturbing,"" as Hong Kong is one of the most vibrant and independent financial centers in the world.
Deepak called for an end to these protests in order to ""restore peace, law and order in society.""
Meanwhile, experts also slammed western media for false reports on the situation.
Western media should be objective over the situation in Hong Kong and report ""what exactly is going on,"" Deepak said.
They ""are silent about Hong Kong demonstrators inflicting injuries on police officers,"" he said, noting that their reports only showed demonstrators being attacked while avoiding mentioning that the demonstrators were engaging in violence themselves.
""They (the western media) are trying to raise the temperature politically to put pressure on China and to destabilize China,"" Mushahid Hussain Syed, chairman of the Pakistani Senate's standing committee on foreign affairs, told Xinhua on Saturday.
To misguide the world about the real situation in Hong Kong and create undue hype of the protests, western media reports are spreading false information by giving inflated figures of the number of the protestors, he said.
""The purpose is manipulated politically to convey messages and to convey a narrative, as if the whole of Hong Kong was in revolt, which is not true at all. They want to encourage and fan the flames of unrest, because it suits them,"" he added."
Xinhua Headlines: How violence has disrupted Hong Kong over last 2 months,"HONG KONG, Aug. 17 (Xinhua) -- Starting from June, Hong Kong's opposition and some radical forces have used the pretext of peaceful demonstration to engage in violent protests.
Though the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government said, on many occasions, that it has completely halted the amendments of two ordinances concerning the transfer of fugitive offenders, protesters continued to escalate violence and cause mayhem in Hong Kong.
Here is a timeline of these violent activities that are aimed to trample the rule of law, sabotage social order, undermine national sovereignty and the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
CHALLENGING GOVERNANCE AUTHORITY
The demonstrations, which started in June, repeatedly became violent clashes under the instigation of individuals with ulterior motives. Some radicals repeatedly mounted attacks on police. They surrounded Hong Kong police headquarters, disrupted government agencies and ransacked the Legislative Council (LegCo) building.
-- On June 9, demonstrators started to protest against the proposed amendments. In the wee hours of June 10, well-organized radical protesters started attacking the LegCo building, blocking roads and assaulting police officers. They clashed with police, with some attempting to rob officers of their guns. Eight policemen were injured.
-- On June 12, an illegal rally started around Admiralty, and some radical members stayed around the LegCo building until midnight. Well-organized protesters assaulted officers with bricks, home-made spears and even petrol bombs, injuring 22 police officers. Though police exercised restraint, the protesters continually assaulted their line of defense and forced police to use appropriate force to disperse demonstrators.
-- On June 21, even after the HKSAR government announced that it had halted the amendments, violence continued. Extremist protesters surrounded police headquarters and wreaked havoc, and blocked the public from using service at the Revenue Tower and the Immigration Tower. Then they blocked Hong Kong government offices and the High Court.
-- On June 26, a few 'fanatics' instigated demonstrators to storm police headquarters for the second time. They repeated similar savage behaviors. Opposition lawmakers were once again present to provide support. The personal data of some police officers was illegally leaked online.
-- On July 1, rioters blocked roads and threw corrosive liquids at police officers. They ransacked the LegCo building and assailed police with toxic chemical powder. They extensively damaged the council chamber, defaced HKSAR regional emblem, tore up the Basic Law, waved a colonial-era flag and even called for an establishment of a so-called ""interim government.""
DISTURBING SOCIAL ORDER
Hong Kong's social disorder worsened in July, as aggressive members unlawfully assembled or launched more demonstrations in various districts of Hong Kong. Violence spread further, affecting the normal lives of more residents.
-- On July 6, disputes broke out in Tuen Mun district between protesters and residents. Residents were besieged, beaten and kicked by radicals. Protesters occupied roads and sieged Tuen Mun police station.
-- On July 7, protesters organized another demonstration in Kowloon, leading to a 50-percent plunge in passengers through West Kowloon high-speed train station, compared with an average weekend. Only 31,000 passengers traveled through the station on that day. After the demonstration, some radical protesters illegally blocked roads in Tsim Sha Tsui, forcing most shops to close early in the once trendy shopping area.
-- On July 13, a demonstration in Sheung Shui district ended with violent clashes with the police. A few radical protesters dismantled iron bars, blocked main roads, beat and attacked police officers with umbrellas, iron bars, suspected toxic powders and corrosive liquids. At least 16 police officers were injured. At night, the radical members continued to sabotage stores in the district. The police then launched a clearance operation in accordance with the law.
-- On July 14, some radical protesters removed the roadside fence in Sha Tin district to block roads, sharpened bamboo branches as weapons, hurled bricks, umbrellas and other debris at police officers from high buildings. Fierce clashes broke out at New Town Plaza, injuring at least 10 police officers. An officer in plain clothes was attacked by a mob. Some officers were left with facial fractures. One police officer's finger was bitten off.
-- On July 27, though the Hong Kong police had issued a notice of objection, some people assembled illegally at the Yuen Long district. A group of radical protesters illegally cut off traffic, sieged police vehicles, smashed car windows and smeared cars with insulting words. Police officers were deployed at the village entrances to prevent conflicts between protesters and villagers. Several radical protesters also sieged the Yuen Long police station, forcing the report room to suspend service. Opposition lawmakers were once again present to support the violent acts.
-- On July 28, a number of radical protesters carried out illegal demonstrations in the central and western parts of Hong Kong Island, seriously hindering traffic. They dug up pavement bricks, destroyed street signs and lampposts, set fires on multiple roads and charged police lines. Violence again escalated, as some people carried lethal weapons such as bows and arrows and petrol bombs.
UNDERMINING ""ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS"" PRINCIPLE
A group of extreme radicals stormed the offices of the Central Government in Hong Kong, insulted the national emblem and flag of China, undermined national sovereignty and dignity and the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
-- On July 21, radical protesters besieged and attacked the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government, defaced the national emblem in front of the building by hurling eggs and black paintballs, damaged security facilities and scrawled graffiti insulting the nation.
They even raved about forming an ""interim legislature"" in a statement read out on the scene.
-- On July 28 and Aug. 4, some radical protesters mounted more attacks at the liaison office but were thwarted by riot police.
-- On Aug. 3 and on Aug. 5, black-clad and masked extreme radicals twice ripped the Chinese national flag off the pole in Tsim Sha Tsui, flung it into the sea, in clear defiance of national sovereignty.
On July 26, police arrested a suspect on suspicion of desecrating the national emblem.
PUSHING HONG KONG TO BRINK
Violence and chaos escalated in August as mobsters used guerrilla tactics to stage strikes, block public transport, prevent residents from going to work, damage public facilities, siege police stations and attack police officers across Hong Kong, pushing the city to the brink.
-- On Aug. 3, radical protesters sabotaged areas in Yau Ma Tei, Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok. They blocked the Cross-Harbor Tunnel twice, paralyzing traffic between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. They charged police stations in Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok and Wong Tai Sin, scribbled words to insult and provocate the police, ruined police vehicles and started fires in front of police stations.
-- On Aug. 4, protesters caused considerable damage in western Hong Kong Island, Causeway Bay and Tseung Kwan O by blocking roads and storming several police stations. They later flocked to Hung Hom to block the Cross-Harbor Tunnel and the Golden Bauhinia Square to smear the sculpture.
-- On Aug. 5, flash mobs stirred up trouble across Hong Kong. They destroyed public facilities, including roadside railings, sidewalk bricks, traffic bollards and lights. As a result, 36 roads and the Cross-Harbor Tunnel were blocked, 96 buses suspended or rerouted, 8 MTR lines obstructed and more than 200 flights canceled.
From the night of Aug. 5 to the wee hours of the following day, some radical protesters raided at least 10 police stations. They scribbled words to insult police, hurled petrol bombs and firebombs at police stations and officers, shot vision-harming lasers, ruined police cars, and caused mayhem on several streets, police stations and buildings. They also cut off power lines.
-- On Aug. 11, protesters threw petrol bombs and wounded at least one policeman.
-- On the evening of Aug. 13 and early on Aug. 14, shockingly violent acts occurred at the Hong Kong International Airport. Some violent radicals attending an unlawful assembly at the airport inflicted severe physical harm to two mainland residents.
Around 8:00 p.m. local time on Aug. 13, they unlawfully detained a resident from Shenzhen surnamed Xu, who held a Hong Kong and Macao travel permit for private visit purposes and was at the airport to see people off. They tied him up, shot a laser at his eyes and beat him into a coma. They also obstructed the way for an ambulance crew to take him to hospital. With the help of the police, it took nearly four hours for Xu to be rescued. As the events played out, they also sieged and assaulted a police officer and snatched his baton.
After midnight of Aug. 14, some violent radicals tied up both hands of a Global Times reporter surnamed Fu and beat him in the name of suspecting him to be a fake reporter, causing multiple injuries to Fu.
The radical protesters have become better-equipped, coordinated and planned, and they have continued to push the level of violence to new heights. Alarmingly, many weapon depots containing explosives, firebombs and knives suspected to be owned by radical protesters have been uncovered in police operations.
From June 9 to Aug. 6, the Hong Kong police arrested 589 people suspected of illegal assembly, rioting and assaulting the police.
What is more alarming is that anti-China forces in the West have colluded with local anti-China forces who intend to mess up Hong Kong. On multiple occasions, foreign nationals were seen meeting and talking with radical protesters. Recently, leaders of ""Hong Kong independence"" groups secretly met with officials of the U.S. Consulate General in Hong Kong. The day after their meeting, the groups said on social media that they plan to boycott classes in September.
It is incontrovertibly evident and without question that the Hong Kong opposition camp and radical groups have colluded with foreign forces. Certain forces in the U.S. and Britain have deliberately ignored extreme violence in the illegal protests and attempted to beautify mobsters as campaigners of ""freedom, democracy and human rights.""
During the recent riots, the Hong Kong Police Force has honored their duties and enforced the law with professionalism and great restraint. The Hong Kong police have been a pillar in safeguarding Hong Kong's social security and the last shield to uphold its social stability. It has maintained its reputation as one of the world's most outstanding police forces. From June 9 to Aug. 5, 139 officers suffered injuries on duty.
Looking back at what happened during the past two months, the ordinance amendment issues have changed in their essence and now bear the features of a ""color revolution.""
Should violence and chaos be allowed to continue, the safety of Hong Kong citizens' lives and property will be endangered, and the governance authority of the SAR government, the cornerstone of the rule of law in Hong Kong, its prosperity and stability, and the ""one country, two systems"" will be destroyed. Citizens of Hong Kong will not allow this to happen. The people of China will not allow this to happen.
On Aug. 7, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council and the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong jointly held a symposium in Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong Province, briefing the attendees on the central authorities' policies on stabilizing Hong Kong's situation. It stressed that the most pressing and overriding task in Hong Kong is to stop violence, end the chaos and restore order.
The recent violence in Hong Kong is intolerable in any civilized, rational society under the rule of law. Any illegal and criminal acts that blatantly defy the basic principle of ""one country, two systems,"" trample the rule of law, destroy social stability and infringe public interest will be brought to justice."
Chinese community in Northern California to rally in support of HKSAR gov't,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 2 (Xinhua) -- Overseas Chinese in Northern California will rally next Sunday to support China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government and Hong Kong police in their efforts to restore peace and the rule of law in the city, organizers said Monday.
The rally, to be attended by various Chinese communities and representatives of overseas Chinese and businesses in Northern California, will be organized by the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association (CCBA) and the Committee to Promote the Reunification of China San Francisco Bay Area Chapter (CPRCSF).
Haibo Deng, president of the CCBA Board of Directors, told a press conference Monday that his organization had a clear-cut position of supporting the HKSAR government and Hong Kong police in taking resolute measures to stop violence by rioters whose actions have caused increasing havoc to the city in the past two months.
The protracted riots in Hong Kong have cast a shadow over the Oriental Pearl, and the violence by radical protesters have disrupted public order, including storming the city's metro station and Hong Kong Legislative Council building, as well as spreading hatred among the public, he said.
CPRCSF President Wei Ming He, who read a statement at the press conference, condemned the radical protesters for hurling petrol bombs at government buildings, attacking law enforcement personnel, blocking traffic, beating innocent people and paralyzing the Hong Kong International Airport.
The violence has stalled Hong Kong's economy, undermined the social order of the city, and plunged Hong Kong into a state of tremendous uncertainty, He said.
He called on all overseas Chinese who care about Hong Kong's future to come forward on Sept. 8 to say ""no"" to all forms of crime and radical protests.
Philip Choi, chief of the CPRCSF Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Group, said he was very worried about the situation in Hong Kong because he had a lot of family members and friends who are working or living there.
It was disappointing and sad to see the beautiful city of Hong Kong being turned into a chaotic place, where violence now occurs daily, he said."
Xinhua Headlines: Prolonged unrest plunges Hong Kong economy into technical recession,"HONG KONG, Oct. 31 (Xinhua) -- More than four months of chaos and unrest have delivered a major blow to Hong Kong's economy, which registered the first decline in almost 10 years and slipped into a technical recession in the past quarter.
 ECONOMIC DOWNTURN
Hong Kong's estimated GDP dropped 2.9 percent year-on-year in the third quarter, in contrast with 0.6-percent and 0.4-percent slight increases in the first and second quarters respectively, according to the statistics authority of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government. Compared to the second quarter, the economy went down 3.2 percent.
Private consumption declined 3.5 percent from a year ago, while local investment significantly dropped 16.3 percent. Goods exports were down by 7 percent and services exports droped 13.7 percent.
""The market did expect a decline, but the headline figures this time, no matter year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter, were far worse than forecast, which was worrying,"" Liao Qun, chief economist of the China CITIC Bank International, said.
The last economic downturn was 10 years ago, when a global financial crisis plunged Hong Kong into a losing streak of four consecutive quarters starting the last quarter of 2008, with the sharpest year-on-year decline of 7.5 percent.
Liao attributed the disappointing performance of this time to unabated turmoil, a major cause of hardship for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), softened consumption willingness of individuals, and dented confidence of investors.
""There has been an all-round impact on the economy,"" said Ronald Wan, chief executive of Partners Capital International. ""From economic growth, domestic demand and retail sales to fixed-asset investment and foreign trade, economic fundamentals retreated comprehensively.""
 UNREST-TRIGGERED RECESSION
A wide range of sectors have been suffering, including tourism, catering and transport. Weighed down by a slowing global economy, Hong Kong's growth had moderated progressively since last year, but there was an abrupt deterioration recently due to the severe impacts of the months-long unrest.
Tourists to Hong Kong halved from a year ago in the first two weeks of October, and turnover of retail sales logged the sharpest decline on record in August.
Cheung Yu-yan, a member of the HKSAR Legislative Council representing the catering functional constituencies, has told the media that the sector is confronted with a more severe situation than that during the 2003 SARS outbreak, as combined turnover dropped 50 percent and 200 to 300 restaurants were closed.
Cheung warned that massive closures were looming if the violence and chaos continued.
With no signs of weakening in violence, an HKSAR government spokesperson expected notable downward pressures on the economy for the rest of the year and that the economy was very likely to record a negative growth for 2019 as a whole.
""Continued escalation will even plunge Hong Kong into a deeper recession,"" Liao said. ""Even if the violence could be stopped and order would be restored, there will still be a long time to fix social split and recover the confidence of investors home and abroad and of consumers.""
Liao said the economy would hardly be back on track even if under the most optimistic conditions.
Hong Kong-based economist Liang Haiming warned that there might be capital tightening, surges in funding costs and even volatility on home and equity markets, if investors' expectations were reserved and ratings on Hong Kong's economy were further downgraded.
 STOPPING VIOLENCE FIRST
Various sectors of Hong Kong have repeatedly said that the most urgent task is to end violence and bring back the peaceful lives, the precondition of a sound business environment and long-term stability and prosperity.
HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam said on Wednesday that the months-long unrest in Hong Kong has hurt its economy and ""the first priority must therefore be to end violence and restore law and order as soon as possible.""
Once calmness returns, Lam said, the HKSAR government will be committed to finding solutions to such ""deep-seated problems"" as social divide and insufficient inclusive growth.
She said it is important to hold fast to the principles that have made Hong Kong ""one of the world's most successful financial and trading economies,"" referring to the ""one country, two systems"" principle, the rule of law and the institutional strengths.
Positive signs have been spotted. Fewer people participated in violent protests recently, and the appeal for order and peace from Hong Kong residents was on the rise.
 CORE COMPETITIVENESS INTACT
Despite the relatively pessimistic prospect on the economy, Lam said on Thursday that Hong Kong's institutional strengths and core competitiveness remain intact when addressing a joint business community luncheon at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center.
Hong Kong retains its core strengths as an international financial center with an unrivalled geographical location, the rule of law, an independent judiciary, the free flow of information and a wide pool of professional talents, she said.
To tackle those challenges ahead, the HKSAR government announced three rounds of pro-growth measures to support enterprises, safeguard jobs, stabilize the economy and strengthen livelihood during the past three months.
The measures will help the SMEs, covering a broad range of sectors including logistics, retails, catering, tourism, construction, agriculture and fisheries. Subsidies will also be provided to badly-hit industries such as transportation and tourism.
""All the measures with a total sum of around 64 billion (Hong Kong) dollars are expected to provide a 2-percent impetus to our economy,"" Lam said.
Lam Kin-fung, member of the Executive Council and vice chairman of the Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong, said Hong Kong could still maintain long-term prosperity with support of the central government, effective measures of the HKSAR government and joint efforts of all sectors in Hong Kong."
Hong Kong airport resumes operation after halt,"HONG KONG, Aug. 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong International Airport started to resume operation on Wednesday after two days of chaos and flight cancellations caused by protesters.
Passengers are now able to conduct check-in procedures after tickets or purchase vouchers are checked by airport staff. One check-in gate is left open for passengers to pass through.
Dozens of protesters are still sitting outside one of the exits of the arrival hall. A demonstration area has been marked out with security staff walking nearby.
Airport Authority Hong Kong said earlier Wednesday that it has obtained an interim injunction to restrain persons from unlawfully and willfully obstructing or interfering with the proper use of Hong Kong International Airport.
The authority emphasized that persons are also restrained from attending or participating in any demonstration or protest or public order event in the airport other than in the area designated by the airport authority.
The interim injunction expressly provides that nothing in the interim injunction shall be construed as authorizing any demonstration, protest or public order event contrary to the Public Order Ordinance.
As one of the busiest in the world, the Hong Kong International Airport handled an average of 200,000 travelers each day in 2018."
"Roundup: Experts urge stop of violence in Hong Kong, denounce external forces","BEIJING, Aug. 22 (Xinhua) -- Experts have urged an end to the blatant violence perpetrated by radical demonstrators in Hong Kong and denounced external forces behind the protests.
Hong Kong, engulfed in protests since early June, has witnessed escalating violence lately involving services cut-off, airport riots, attack on police and assault of journalists, which risk tipping this once-prosperous financial hub and alluring tourist destination into recession.
Madan Regmi, chairman of China Study Center, a Nepal-based think tank said he is saddened by the worrying situation in Hong Kong.
Deeply concerned with the situation, he said ""the protesters, with ill intentions, are abusing the basic rights to realize their hidden interests ... and unlike normal protesters with reasonable demands.""
Hong Kong enjoys its own system, quite different from the system in the Chinese mainland, Regmi said.
""But no matter how big differences are in these two areas, 'one China' policy is the precondition. What the violent protesters are doing has defied the one China principle in a degrading way,"" he stressed.
In response to Hong Kong-related queries at a meeting with the foreign ministers of Japan and the Republic of Korea on Wednesday, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi condemned the violent attacks as a serious ""challenge of the bottom line"" of the ""one country, two systems"" principle governing Hong Kong.
""No responsible government or rule-of-law society will tolerate these acts,"" Wang said, emphasizing that Hong Kong affairs are China's internal affairs and brook no interference by external forces.
Wang called on relevant parties to uphold an objective and fair position on the situation in Hong Kong.
Comrade Dilip Barua, general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Bangladesh, expressed his deep concern regarding the violent unrest and blockades in Hong Kong in the name of so-called ""democratic movement.""
""Hong Kong is an integral part of China on the basis of 'one country, two systems,'"" which has functioned well since its return to China in 1997, Barua said.
He urged Hong Kong people not to be ""misguided"" by ""some vested interest groups"" seeking to foil this fundamental principle but to engage in ""building up a more prosperous Hong Kong.""
R.N.Bhaskar, consulting editor of ""Asia Converge"" and guest faculty at several institutes in India and overseas said the strikes and the airport blockades were ""a foolish move"" at the expense of huge economic losses to Hong Kong's businesses.
Denouncing the provocations on local police, he said, ""don't provoke police, don't get violent, don't use force. Force will be met with force because you are challenging the sovereignty of the country.""
""Don't go on to strike, because the longer the strike, the worse will be the plight of business and so on,"" Bhaskar said, calling for more restraint rather than violence.
John Zhang, honorary president of Shanghainese Association of Australia, said the future of Hong Kong is held in the hands of its people and not others, because this is purely an internal affair of China.
He believed that demonstrations, whether in the United States, European countries or in Hong Kong, should be carried out in line with relevant laws and regulations, and not at the price of disrupting social order and grinding local services to a complete halt.
Meanwhile, Hugh H. Mo, a former deputy police commissioner of New York City Police Department (NYPD), said that the right to protest should be respected on condition that it is carried out in line with laws.
""The police, a symbol of law, are the defenders of our society, and should never be treated as enemies,"" he said.
The former NYPD officer said that he would like to see the rule of law restored in Hong Kong, a society long famous for its prosperity, good governance and friendliness.
Faruk Boric, a renowned media commentator in Bosnia and Herzegovina and also chairman of BiH-China Friendship Association said that the Asian financial hub of Hong Kong, once crowned the ""Pearl of the Orient"" is dimmed by the ongoing violence, and will lose its luster if nothing is done to stop this.
He called on young people in Hong Kong to cherish the region's hard-won economic status and participate constructively to restore peace, order and the dynamism for growth."
"1,474 arrested in Hong Kong's drawn-out violence: police","HONG KONG, Sept. 20 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong police said Friday that a total of 1,474 people, aged between 12 and 84, have been arrested in violent protests that have roiled Hong Kong since June.
Kong Wing-cheung, senior superintendent of the Police Public Relations Branch (PPRB), told a media briefing that 207 people have been charged with offences ranging from rioting and unlawful assembly to criminal damage and possession of offensive weapons.
Tse Chun-chung, chief superintendent of PPRB, dismissed ungrounded accusations in media and online, including police officers from the Chinese mainland infiltrating in the Hong Kong police and Hong Kong police officers committing rape and murders.
""We must emphasize that these allegations are totally false and ungrounded, and they are inciting public hatred and tearing our society apart,"" Tse said.
""No civilized society will condone such acts,"" he said.
Unprecedented scenes of violence have been playing out in Hong Kong over the past few months, as radical protesters assaulted police with petrol bombs and bricks, prompting the latter to respond with tear gas in some cases.
The Hong Kong Police Force said that over 2,200 police officers and their family members have been doxxed since June, as online hate speech surged amid the unrest."
Hong Kong cancels all flights as protesters disrupt airport,"HONG KONG, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- All flights in and out of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region were cancelled on Monday due to a protest held in the Hong Kong International Airport, according to local airport authority.
All check-in services were suspended, said the Airport Authority Hong Kong in a statement on Monday afternoon, adding that departing flights that had completed check-in procedures and arriving flights already heading to Hong Kong were excluded from the suspension.
The Airport Authority Hong Kong said it has launched an emergency management center in the airport and is keeping close contact with airliners to try to resume operation as soon as possible.
The airport authority also advised the public to avoid trips to the airport, citing traffic congestion and full parking lots.
Four bus services of the airport express have changed route and one bus station in the airport has also been closed, according to local traffic authority."
Commentary: Time for West to get rid of bias and show world the real Hong Kong,"BEIJING, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- As the latest incident in the Hong Kong chaos, violent radicals tied up both hands of a reporter from Global Times, a newspaper in the Chinese mainland. They besieged and assaulted him, causing multiple injuries.
Such an infringement of human rights and press freedom has drawn wide condemnation. It offers yet more proof that the protest in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has become violent and illegal. Some Western media, however, once again turned a blind eye, challenging the core principles of journalism and showing bias and double standards over issues concerning China.
Let's take a look at the media coverage of two large-scale protests, one in 2011 and the other in 2019.
In the first case, when protesters demonstrated for weeks, marching with banners, shouting slogans and camping in the city center, some Western media described the ""violence"" as ""one police officer suffered minor injuries after being knocked off a scooter,"" while others focused on sexual assaults in the camp.
The reports quoted police sources a lot, justifying the arrests of hundreds, which turned into thousands in the end, as saying the protesters blocked traffic and caused inconvenience in the city.
In the second case, protesters have demonstrated for weeks, smashing the glass wall of a local government building with iron sticks, injuring police officers, smudging the national emblem, throwing the national flag into the sea, disrupting order at an airport, forcing the cancellation of flights, stranding thousands of passengers and beating passers-by.
""We cannot avoid this. It is somehow unavoidable because we fight for our final goal,"" a CNN report quoted a protester as saying. In other reports, the protesters were described as being ""apologetic"" after the violence.
Few police voices could be heard, and police officers were portrayed, both in words and pictures, as using tear gas, pepper spray, and batons and firing rubber bullets.
The first case is the Occupy Wall Street movement and the second is the ongoing protest in Hong Kong.
When the Western reports described the protests as ""peaceful,"" few gave details such as how protesters destroyed the glass wall and defaced the national emblem. Would Western governments allow such damage to their parliament houses as well?
When the reporters interviewed dozens of protesters and claimed that they were beaten, few bothered to investigate why the police officers were injured.
When they managed to find some foreign passengers stranded at the airport who said the situation was acceptable and supported the protesters, they deliberately ignored a larger number of others who found it unacceptable.
Chunsheng Bai, a professor of communication studies at California State University in Los Angeles, once told Xinhua that the Western mainstream media had done a very poor job in reporting certain negative things in their own countries, such as government corruption and greedy practices by Wall Street, big banks and rich corporations.
The biased reports can be extremely harmful as they mislead readers and distort public perception. Western media should engage in fair and unbiased reporting since readers are entitled to know what's really going on in Hong Kong."
"2nd LD: Radicals vandalize Hong Kong metro stations, throw petrol bombs","HONG KONG, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- An unlawful assembly in Hong Kong turned violent again on Sunday as radical protesters vandalized subway stations, set fires and hurled petrol bombs.
Destructive acts were committed extensively in areas of Admiralty and Wan Chai in Hong Kong Island, as rioters threw Molotov cocktails into the Wan Chai Mass Transit Railway (MTR) Station and set fires on roads and near MTR entrances.
Some radicals hurled bricks and petrol bombs at police officers trying to keep order near the headquarters of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government.
Traffic was disrupted as protesters moved trash cans and dismantled iron railings. They also broke road surface to collect bricks used against the police.
At around 6:15 p.m. (local time), a black-clad man scaled a flagpole outside the Queen Elizabeth Stadium in Wan Chai and removed the Chinese national flag from the flagpole while a mob around held umbrellas to shield him. They later torched the flag on the ground.
The desecration of the national flag has occurred a number of times in recent unrests. The HKSAR government has strongly condemned such acts, saying they violated the National Flag and National Emblem Ordinance and offenders could face imprisonment for up to three years.
Hong Kong police said in a statement that the violent acts on Sunday afternoon posed ""a serious threat to the safety of everyone at scene,"" and after repeated warnings to the radicals went futile, they had deployed tear gas and used appropriate force to disperse them.
Given the violent incidents, 23 bus routes were suspended and more than 70 had traffic diversion. Metro trains also had to skip several stations in affected areas.
Several shopping malls were closed, and the swimming pool, tennis courts and bowling greens of Victoria Park and the Hong Kong Central Library also suspended services.
""Of course it will affect our business and cause sales to fall,"" said a woman when pulling down the shutters of a grocery store in the shopping district of Causeway Bay at about 2:00 p.m. (local time). ""We had to close early because the protest may bring tear gas.""
Some hotels in Wan Chai temporarily shut their gates as a gaggle of protesters walked by and advised their guests to mind their personal safety.
The violence on Sunday followed a night of unrest on Saturday that saw radicals block roads and throw petrol bombs outside the HKSAR goverment headquarters complex.
Since June, Hong Kong has witnessed escalating violence that originated from protests over the proposed ordinance amendments concerning fugitive offenders transfers.
Although the HKSAR government has withdrawn the amendments, violence continued as protesters veered off their original agenda to raise the ante, causing a split in society and taking a heavy toll on the economy.
On Thursday evening, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Carrie Lam and other officials had candid communication with the members of the public at the first ""Community Dialogue."" Lam said she will continue reaching out to people through dialogues to seek a way out for Hong Kong."
"Violent, disruptive protests to hurt HK's prosperity, stability: former Dutch diplomat","THE HAGUE, Aug. 13, (Xinhua) -- The increasingly violent and disruptive protests in China's Hong Kong are bad for the economic hub and will hurt its prosperity and stability, said a former Dutch consul-general to Hong Kong.
Jochum Haakma, who served as consul-general of the Netherlands in Hong Kong/Macao and Shanghai from 1997 to 2006, made the remarks in a recent interview with Xinhua.
""Hong Kong has continued to prosper under the 'one country, two systems' principle and has become over the years economically more and more integrated with the mainland,"" said Haakma, currently chairman of the Netherlands-China Business Council and chairman of EU-China Business Association in Brussels.
""The Greater Bay Area initiative is a good example where high tech and R&D in Guangdong Province go hand in hand with the more advanced and refined international financial expertise and opportunities that Hong Kong brings to the equation,"" he said.
""The Belt and Road Initiative also offers enormous opportunities for a closer cooperation between Guangdong Province, the mainland at large and Hong Kong,"" he said.
However, the increasingly violent and disruptive protests are very bad for the image and reputation of Hong Kong as an economic and financial hub in the region, said Haakma.
""It will certainly impact the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong in the long run. The GDP growth rate has already adjusted to a far lower percentage,"" said Haakma, who has more than 35 years of China experience.
Haakma said the violent actions have gone beyond the freedom of demonstration and assembly and ""are merely caused by a small group of radicals.""
He expressed his belief that the government of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, will be able to clear the situation without any interference from outside.
China has slashed foreign interference on the Hong Kong situation and vowed that any attempt to interfere in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs is doomed to failure.
""Any attempt to undermine the 'one country, two systems' and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability will surely be resolutely opposed by all Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots,"" said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying last Wednesday.
Hua urged the United States and some other Western countries to honor their commitment and stop supporting violent activities and intervening in Hong Kong affairs in any form, saying there are clear signs of foreign manipulation, plotting and even organization in the relevant violent incidents judging from what was reported by the media."
"Man charged with insulting national flag, denied bail in Hong Kong","HONG KONG, Sept. 7 (Xinhua) -- A man arrested for arson and burning a Chinese national flag during last weekend's protests near the Hong Kong International Airport appeared in court on Saturday and was denied bail.
The 22-year-old man was arrested for setting a Chinese national flag, banners, water-filled barriers and other objects on fire during protests in Tung Chung on Sept. 1.
Charged with criminal damage, conspiracy to desecrate the national flag, conspiracy to commit arson and arson, the man appeared in court at the Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on Saturday morning.
The case was adjourned to Nov. 15, pending further investigation, including the examination of the retractable batons and suspected air guns seized at the scene, as well as CCTV footage and the defendant's public transport card records.
Due to the seriousness of the case, the defendant was denied bail and remanded in custody."
1st LD Writethru: Hong Kong police ban Saturday's rallies over safety concern,"HONG KONG, Aug. 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police have banned the application of public processions on Saturday to ensure the safety of residents and public order after several similar events turned extremely violent recently.
Kwok Pak-chung, regional commander of the Hong Kong Island, said at a daily press conference here on Thursday that the police have banned the application for a public meeting and public processions in Central and Western Districts on this Saturday, without naming the applicant.
""The objection is in the interest of public safety, public order, and protection of rights and freedom of other residents,"" Kwok said.
Recent peaceful demonstrations have easily descended to violent incidents and quickly spread to more areas in Hong Kong, with rioters tearing down public facilities, assaulting police officers with deadly weapons, vandalizing shops, and attacking residents.
The police believe certain protesters will commit violent acts during the proposed gathering, Kwok said. ""We have noticed a lot of online comments to propagate the use of extreme violence in the coming protests. Some even went to the extreme of promoting deadly violence.""
Kwok said there is a very high chance that these proposed public events will be hijacked as radicals have indeed realized their extreme ideas into reality. ""Police must take proactive step to prevent such violence.""
New arrests have been made for offenses in protests over the last two months. Tse Chun-chung, chief superintendent of police public relations branch, said eight males were detained Wednesday, with seven of them involved in the besiegement of the Hong Kong Legislative Council, Police headquarters, or Hong Kong International Airport.
Tse also said personal privacy of 1,662 police officers and their family members have been leaked online since June and some even incited others to threaten and harass them, as well as use their information to illegally borrow money.
The police have arrested 19 related suspects, including four females, since July 2, Tse said."

"Legal professionals of Hong Kong deplore damage of legal system by illegal gatherings, violence","HONG KONG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Violent protesters organized illegal gatherings and even attacked police officers in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) at the weekend. Members of the Hong Kong legal profession deplored these radical acts, which they say have sabotaged the social peace and challenged the legal system.
The legal professionals called upon all members of the society to show support for the Hong Kong Police Force in maintaining the rule of law, so as to restore the social order as soon as possible.
 CHALLENGE OF LAW NEVER TOLERATED IN ANY SOCIETY
The protesters have been deliberately breaking the law during the past two days as the police have clearly objected to the application for the public processions and the Appeal Board on Public Meetings and Processions have also rejected the relevant appeal, said Tony Kan Chung Nin, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and founding chairman of the Association of Hong Kong Professionals.
""In any country or region, if people don't obey the law, the society will fall into chaos,"" he said, expressing fury at the Hong Kong opposition camp which has been trying to find excuses for the law-breaking behaviors.
Every Hong Kong citizen should obey the law in Hong Kong. The gatherings during the weekend were illegal and nobody should ever have participated in the processions, said Jimmy Ng Wing-ka, a member of the Legislative Council of the HKSAR.
""The violent protesters have broken many law items, including criminal damage, arson, unlawful assemblies, riot, obstructing police officers' execution of duties, assaulting police officers, fighting in a public place, with some serious violations carrying life imprisonment,"" said Lawrence Ma, chairman of the Hong Kong Legal Exchange Foundation.
Violence has been escalating during the past month with some people even carrying assaulting weapons. Violence has been overriding the law and is developing into extreme violence, said Maggie Chan Man Ki, solicitor and founding president of the Small and Medium Law Firms Association of Hong Kong.
Some violent radicals have stormed government buildings and assaulted law enforcers, crossing the bottom line of peace, seriously threatening the public security and rule of law in Hong Kong and severely challenging the ""one country, two systems"" in Hong Kong. These acts should never be tolerated by Hong Kong and the country and should be strongly condemned, said Albert Wu, a practising barrister in Hong Kong.
The rule of law and spirit of law-abiding have been the key to the long-term peace and prosperity of Hong Kong, said Raymond Li, a trainee solicitor in Hong Kong. Born in Hong Kong and having lived here for 30 years, he said every person who loves Hong Kong feels sorrowful that law-breaking behaviors have been taking place in Hong Kong.
""The Hong Kong society has become less civilized and people now are not valuing rational communication as before. Nowadays whoever is more violent becomes the boss. This should never be tolerated,"" he said.
He called upon all Hong Kong lawyers and Hong Kong citizens to support Hong Kong police in decisively enforcing the law and arresting all law breakers in accordance with the law.
 OPPOSITION CAMP BLAMED FOR ENCOURAGING, CONNIVING SABOTAGE OF RULE OF LAW
Lawrence Ma expressed sorrow for the undermining of Hong Kong's rule of law, saying, ""Hong Kong, renowned for discipline and rule of law, has been harassed by the bunch of mobs for quite a time. It is a disgrace to Hong Kong.""
Jimmy Ng said that acts of the illegal protesters have been damaging Hong Kong's legal system and rule of law.
""Knowingly breaking the law would spoil the confidence of Hong Kong residents and the international community in the rule of law of the region,"" he said.
Ng also blamed the spread of illegal acts on the opposition camp. The opposition, according to Ng, has two motives in defending the illegal rallies: firstly, it eyes elections, hoping to rake in more votes; secondly, it is always keen to challenge the government.
""Behind the scene of the demonstrations, they (the opposition politicians) stir up and help boost the violent protesters' confidence,"" said he.
Recalling the remarks made by some opposition leaders during the past over one month, Maggie Chan said the comments from the opposition legislators have whitewashed violence, helping it escalate step by step to the level of the committing of arson and possession of assaulting weapons.
""I think those opposition legislators who encourage violence must be held accountable for these violent incidents,"" she said.
The illegal demonstrations are not merely targeting the proposed amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance, but also the administration of the SAR and the principle of ""one country, two systems,"" she opined.
Chan called for more support to police enforcement of the law and zero tolerance of illegal acts.
""Law and politics are both important. Any political appeals must be made within the framework of the law,"" she said.
Raymond Li was furious about the opposition's agitative political rhetoric to instigate the youth to stage illegal protests and commit violence.
He said that the government and the whole legal profession, on the one hand, must sternly condemn the violent acts, and on the other hand must swiftly sue the suspects according to the crime ordinance.
 HONG KONG PEOPLE SHOULD SUPPORT POLICE IN DEFENDING RULE OF LAW
Speaking highly of the performance of the Hong Kong Police Force, Tony Kan said they have exercised restraint and refrained from excessive use of force and escalation of the conflicts.
""The Hong Kong police are very rational and professional in enforcing the law,"" he said, suggesting that the police now are totally justified to boost the use of force when facing violent assaults.
Echoing Kan, Jimmy Ng said that while being attacked by violent protesters, the police had issued warnings before taking necessary and appropriate measures of force.
He praised the police for their hardworking and firm attitude, saying, ""Many police officers had to be on duty for more than 10 hours a day under such difficult circumstances to uphold social peace and stability.""
The whole society should express gratitude to the police for their wholehearted devotion and professionalism, Maggie Chan said, noting that the police are an important force to maintain social stability under the principle of ""one country, two systems.""
She called on Hong Kong citizens to give full support to the police in strictly enforcing the law, noting that when violent acts escalate, it is even more necessary for the police to fulfil their duties in the utmost efforts in order to bring all offenders to justice.
Hailing the performance of the Hong Kong police, Raymond Li expressed the hope that the police will stand up to the pressure and perform their duties in accordance with the law.
Li also called on the Hong Kong people to support the police with actions to help safeguard Hong Kong's peace and stability."
"Interview: U.S. gives ""false signals"" to Hong Kong violent protesters, says scholar","NEW YORK, Oct. 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government is giving ""false signals of assurance and support"" to violent protesters in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), said a renowned U.S. expert on China.
""With regard to the U.S. role, it has been deeply unhelpful,"" said Sourabh Gupta, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Institute for China-America Studies, in a written interview with Xinhua on Monday.
In terms of the U.S. official policy position, it is ""a reasonable one: the Basic Law is supreme and all parties must adhere to it fully,"" said Gupta.
""The real problem has been the U.S. veiled intentions: to first stir the pot, and thereafter to fan the flames of protest by providing oxygen to the worst political and militant elements within the protest movement,"" he said.
""Not once have I heard the U.S. strongly condemn the unacceptable violence that we now casually see on a day-to-day basis ... even though both the Hong Kong government and the central government have scrupulously adhered to 'one country, two systems' (principle) throughout the protest period,"" he said.
The expert noted that the United States is ""giving false signals of assurance and support to the worst elements within the protest movement ... and it is doing so knowingly.""
""But it has no scruples running with the hares and hunting with the hounds, regardless of the consequences, so long as it can embarrass Beijing,"" he said. ""This is what U.S. policy has come down to.""
Gupta said the violent protests in Hong Kong ""should have ended weeks ago,"" as the basic demands that they set to attain were achieved in early September in the form of the withdrawal of the extradition bill.
The HKSAR government announced on Sept. 4 that it would formally withdraw the proposed amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance.
At that point, the protesters ""should have been toning down"" their activity and ""pressing their other immediate demands within a civil society dialogue framework,"" said Gupta. ""Instead, they've gone in the opposite direction and are hoping to use their mobilization to effect changes within Hong Kong's system of representation within the LegCo (Legislative Council). This is just plain wrong.""
""A deep and illuminating education of what 'one country, two systems' (principle) entails"" is deeply needed, the expert noted.
As for the violent, radical fringe groups, Gupta said, they deserve ""nothing less than heavy jail sentences."""
"Xinhua Headlines: Hong Kong people express support for police, calling for end to violence","HONG KONG, Aug. 10 (Xinhua) -- Large groups of Hong Kong people visited several police stations in Hong Kong Saturday to express their firm support for and utmost respect to the police force.
The scene stood in stark contrast to the chaotic and violent besieges of police stations by black-clad protesters on many nights over the past weeks.
""The police have been working really hard to safeguard social order. We came here to show our support,"" said a resident surnamed Chan, who visited Kwai Chung Police Station with his wife and son. The boy gave the police a hand-written card as a gift.
""I hope our children can learn to love peace and how to act as righteous people,"" Chan said. ""I also want to see society restore order and for there to be no more violence.""
Local business leader Raymond Tsoi Chi-chung and his friends visited Central Police Station to express their support to the ""core force for protecting Hong Kong.""
""Recent violent incidents have reduced Hong Kong to an economic trough,"" Tsoi said. ""I hope Hong Kong people can focus on stabilizing the economy.""
A police officer surnamed Lau has become an internet celebrity after a video went viral showing him confronting a crowd of protesters that had surrounded and attacked him.
""Hong Kong police are capable of coping with the mobsters, but it has torn my heart out either to hit them or not, as they are also Chinese,"" said Lau in a text message to a reporter, which drew immense online support for both his bravery and compassion.
Carrie Lam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), on Friday visited Wong Tai Sin Police Station and dormitory quarters which had been attacked by radical protesters. Lam expressed thanks to the police personnel for their hard work to safeguard public security in Hong Kong.
Lam also demanded renovation of the damaged buildings and heightened security in the dormitory quarters to give the peace back to the police families.
PROFESSIONAL AND RESTRAINED
Over the past two months, the Hong Kong police have been praised for showing professionalism and exercising restraint with the use of appropriate force to cope with violent protests.
""The approach the police adopted to dealing with violence is appropriate and balanced,"" said Chan Man Ki, founding president of the Small and Medium Law Firms Association of Hong Kong.
Chan noted that far from rallying in a peaceful manner, the protesters have committed various offenses on the street, ranging from setting fires and throwing rocks and iron bars at the police to using offensive weapons, including explosives and homemade sharp objects, and besieging police stations.
""Facing violence of such degree, the police had every right to use appropriate force in an effort to end violence and protect public safety,"" said the legal expert.
During the protests, police officers balanced the exercise of the right to freedom of speech for protesters and the right of other people to use the roads, a Hong Kong police officer told Xinhua.
But police were mandated to take action when crimes were committed, said the officer, who declined to be named or disclose his rank.
""All the duties assigned to on-site police officers bear one characteristic: totally not proactive,"" he said.
The officer said he saw in person one of his colleagues hit hard by a protester in the face.
""Part of his eyeball collapsed, which severely affected his eyesight. The injury may be permanent,"" he said.
In response to the attacks, the police officer said his colleagues only resorted to the minimum use of force, such as using batons, tear gas and rubber rounds to disperse the crowd. ""We never used any lethal or deadly weapon against the protestors.""
Elsie Leung, former secretary for justice of the HKSAR government, said various actions of the protesters have gone far beyond the realm of peaceful demonstrations -- ranging from storming and vandalizing the Legislative Council building and storming the institution of the central government in Hong Kong to paralyzing the transport network and assaulting the police force with bricks and petrol bombs.
""No one is above the law,"" she said, stressing that all the offenders should be brought to justice.
ENORMOUS STRESS
While battling to contain violence on the street, Hong Kong police officers had to face online assault, enduring all sorts of ridicule, humiliation and even threats.
""Many police officers are working more than 10 hours each day. They are also under tremendous mental stress for being assaulted by the radicals on social media,"" said Lam Chi-wai, chairman of the Junior Police Officers' Association of the Hong Kong Police Force.
""Even so, they are still working hard and sparing no effort to safeguard social stability,"" Lam said.
""We are facing a very serious situation of harassment on ourselves and family members, including kids,"" the unnamed police officer said. ""We were being attacked at every angle imaginable.""
In some online chat groups, the radicals used abusive language against the police, drew caricatures and made videos to embarrass them and even revealed their personal information as a way of intimidation and threat.
The enormous workload and stress on the police officers have taken a toll on their families members.
During a recent rally held by police supporters, organizers played an audio clip featuring the worrying wife of a police officer.
""As the spouse of a police officer, I couldn't sleep many nights and don't know what to do,"" she said. ""But I feel obliged to speak out (against violence).""
The audio clip ended with the sound of a little girl asking, ""Daddy, when are you coming home?""
A Hong Kong resident surnamed Wong said many of her family members are working on the police force, and she felt heartsore to see them work day and night to keep public order.
""I hope the chaotic situation will subside and we can get back to our normal days as soon as possible,"" she said.
The central authorities have also expressed unswerving support for the Hong Kong police.
At a press conference in late July, Yang Guang, a spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, expressed understanding for the Hong Kong police force and their families for the tremendous stress they have been under.
""I'd like to take this opportunity to pay our high respect to the outstanding Hong Kong police officers who have been on the job, performed their duties, showed no fear, and endured a lot of humiliation,"" said Yang."
"Roundup: Radicals vandalize Hong Kong metro stations, throw petrol bombs","HONG KONG, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- An unlawful assembly in Hong Kong turned violent again on Sunday as radical protesters vandalized subway stations, set fires and hurled petrol bombs.
Destructive acts were committed extensively in areas of Admiralty, Causeway Bay and Wan Chai in Hong Kong Island, as rioters threw Molotov cocktails into the Wan Chai Mass Transit Railway (MTR) Station and set fires on roads and near MTR entrances.
A number of stores and bank outlets, including one Starbucks outlet, in the busy shopping district of Causeway Bay were harassed by protesters who spray-painted graffiti and put up boycott posters on the shop fronts.
Some radicals hurled bricks and petrol bombs at police officers trying to keep order near the headquarters of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government. Some rioters formed a three-man slingshot to lob stones into the complex before being subdued by police.
Traffic was disrupted as protesters moved trash cans and dismantled iron railings. They also broke road surface to collect bricks used against the police.
At around 6:15 p.m. (local time), a black-clad man scaled a flagpole outside the Queen Elizabeth Stadium in Wan Chai and removed the Chinese national flag while a mob around held umbrellas to shield him. They later torched the flag on the ground.
The desecration of the national flag has occurred a number of times in recent unrests. The HKSAR government has strongly condemned such acts, saying they violated the National Flag and National Emblem Ordinance and offenders could face imprisonment for up to three years.
Hong Kong police said in a statement that the violent acts on Sunday afternoon posed ""a serious threat to the safety of everyone at scene,"" and after repeated warnings to the radicals went futile, they had deployed tear gas and used appropriate force to disperse them.
The violence continued into Sunday night, as protesters continued to paralyze traffic, face off with the police and scuffle with people who held different views in Causeway Bay. At least one man was reportedly beaten up and sent to hospital.
Given the violent incidents, 23 bus routes were suspended and more than 70 had traffic diversion. Metro trains also had to skip several stations in affected areas.
Numerous shopping malls and street stores were closed, and the swimming pool, tennis courts and bowling greens of Victoria Park and the Hong Kong Central Library also suspended services.
""Of course it will affect our business and cause sales to fall,"" said a woman when pulling down the shutters of a grocery store in Causeway Bay at about 2 p.m.
Some hotels in Wan Chai temporarily shut their gates as a gaggle of protesters walked by and advised their guests to mind their personal safety.
The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) on Sunday strongly denounced the mob's sabotage that led to the cancellation of a number of celebrations of the National Day, saying their acts have deprived people's rights to participate in these activities.
The violence on Sunday followed a night of unrest on Saturday that saw radicals block roads and throw petrol bombs outside the HKSAR goverment headquarters complex.
Since June, Hong Kong has witnessed escalating violence that originated from protests over the proposed ordinance amendments concerning fugitive offenders transfers.
Although the HKSAR government has withdrawn the amendments, violence continued as protesters veered off their original agenda to raise the ante, causing a split in society and taking a heavy toll on the economy.
On Thursday evening, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Carrie Lam and other officials had candid communication with the members of the public at the first ""Community Dialogue."" Lam said she will continue reaching out to people through dialogues to seek a way out for Hong Kong."
"Leaders of political groups advocating ""independence"" taken to court: police","HONG KONG, Aug. 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police has confirmed that Joshua Wong Chi-fung and Agnes Chow Ting, leaders of Demosisto advocating ""Hong Kong's independence,"" were taken to court Friday.
Tse Chun-chung, chief superintendent of police public relations branch, said that at a daily press conference Friday.
Wong was arrested on Friday morning on charges of ""inciting others to participate in unauthorized gatherings,"" ""organizing unauthorized gatherings"" and ""knowingly participating in unauthorized gatherings.""
Chow was arrested on charges of ""inciting others to participate in unauthorized gatherings"" and ""knowingly participating in unauthorized gatherings.""
According to the press conference, the police also on Thursday evening detained Andy Chan Ho-tin on charges of rioting and assaulting a police officer. Chan was the leader of Hong Kong National Party, a political group that has been announced illegal by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government.
Tse said the police have been investigating offenses in protests over the past two months and have made seven new arrests since Thursday evening, with suspects involved in the besiegement of the Hong Kong Legislative Council and Police headquarters, or other violent incidents.
""We take a zero-tolerance approach to all violent incidents and all arrests were made based on enough evidence,"" Tse said."
"Feature: Families call for solidarity, harmony in Hong Kong","HONG KONG, Aug. 24 (Xinhua) -- Cheng Kwan Chi, a Hong Kong student ready to pursue an art degree, produced a canvas painting during her summer vacation to support Hong Kong police and express her hope for harmony for the Oriental Pearl.
On Saturday, Cheng, along with her parents and younger brother, attended a event in the Ocean Park, which was organized by Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association to unite families in their calls for order and harmony.
The recent chaos in Hong Kong, in which radical protesters resorted to violence, have left families and friends divided, Cheng and her parents said.
""Some students are very active in the protests, but their parents do not agree, so they have had huge quarrels among the families,"" said Cheng, 18.
""I think those people are too hot-headed and they never really thought things through. I think one should never hurt their family just because of differences in political opinions,"" she said.
Cheng said now when she spends time with her friends, they don't discuss politics.
The recent social turmoil has roiled Hong Kong and disrupted people's lives. In the last two months, industries such as import and export, shipping, logistics, transportation, tourism, catering, and retail have seen sharp decline.
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government revised downward the real economic growth forecast for 2019 as a whole to 0 to 1 percent, from an earlier estimate of 2 to 3 percent.
""In Hong Kong, we have a saying, if you stop working, you have nothing to eat. The violent protest has already hurt jobs. If they were to continue, families will suffer, and their lives will become even more hard,"" said Cheng's father Cheng Tung Kin, who works in logistics.
""Parents are the last line of defence for the children. I think every parent should teach their children to use reason and be objective when they think and judgement,"" said Cheng.
Over 800 people attended the ceremony in the Ocean Park. From Aug. 24 to Nov. 10, family events will be held each weekend at the park which will attract an estimated total of 85,000 people, said Gao Yingxin, chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association.
HKSAR government financial secretary Paul Chan also attended the event.
""The recent violent actions have not only affected people's lives and the economy, but also damaged the international image of Hong Kong, and challenged 'one country, two systems',"" said Chan.
These actions violate the core values of Hong Kong which are peace, reason, openness, diversity and inclusiveness, Chan said.
Chan warned that Hong Kong's economy is in a dire situation. It is very likely to experience negative growth in the third quarter, he said.
The HKSAR government has rolled out a package of boosting measures with a total value of 19.1 billion HK dollars (about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars). Chan said he hoped the measures will help small and medium-sized businesses and the people tide over the difficulties.
Chan reiterated his opposition to violence. ""Although we may have different views, people must never use violence to undermine peace, and express themselves in a reckless manner,"" he said.
""I hope that the public will join the government in opposing all acts of violence,"" he said.
""Hong Kong has come a long way from a small fishing village more than 100 years ago to an international financial, shipping and trade hub. It took generations of hard work. We are duty-bound to guard its peace and prosperity,"" he said."

1st LD Writethru: Hong Kong court extends interim injunction at airport amid continuing threat of disturbances,"HONG KONG, Aug. 23 (Xinhua) -- The High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region extended an interim injunction at the Hong Kong International Airport on Friday amid repeated calls on social media for further disturbances at the airport in the coming weekend.
After days of disturbances and violence by unlawful assemblies at the airport, the Airport Authority Hong Kong obtained on Aug. 13 an interim injunction from the court to restrain persons from unlawfully and willfully obstructing or interfering with the proper use of the Hong Kong International Airport.
Judge Wilson Chan of the Court of First Instance of the High Court said Friday in the judgement that while disturbances at the airport have seemingly subsided after the grant of the interim injunction order on Aug. 13, there is evidence of continuing threats to the airport in the coming weekend, including repeated calls on social media to obstruct access control points to prevent passengers from entering the airport.
""Given the continuing threat of disturbances at the airport, I have no hesitation in continuing the order to maintain the status quo until trial or further order of the court,"" said the judgement.
""The balance of convenience is strongly in favor of continuing the order,"" the judgement said, stressing that ""the smooth running of the airport is of crucial significance to Hong Kong, in particular the security and safety of its citizens and travelers, its commercial interests, as well as its international reputation.""
The airport authority said in a statement following the court's decision that it was in the process of obtaining sealed copies of the order and would publish the order in accordance with the court's requirements.
""Any person who neglects to obey or comply with the order, or any person who assists or incites, aids or abets another in disobeying the order may be held in contempt of court, and is liable to imprisonment or a fine,"" the statement said, adding that enforcement proceedings may be taken to compel persons to comply with the order.
Blocking roads connecting to the airport may constitute acts of unlawfully and willfully obstructing or interfering with the proper use of the airport, the statement added.
""Persons are also restrained by the order from attending or participating in any demonstration or protest or public order event in the airport other than strictly in compliance with the order,"" it said, adding that the order expressly provides that nothing in the order shall be construed as authorizing any demonstration, protest or public order event contrary to the HKSAR Public Order Ordinance.
The airport authority started to implement an access control plan for the terminal buildings at the airport on Aug. 14 as a new security measure after the disturbances. Only passengers with a valid air ticket or boarding pass for a flight in the next 24 hours and a valid travel document, or airport staff with relevant identification document will be allowed to enter the terminal buildings.
The airport authority said the access control plan will continue upon further notice.
The airport authority put out advertisements on local newspapers on Friday, urging young people who love Hong Kong not to support or take part in any action that would obstruct the airport's operation or damage its international image, so as to avoid impact on the hundreds of thousands of people working in Hong Kong's industries of aviation, tourism, transport, logistics and trade.
Meanwhile, seven civil aviation trade unions in Hong Kong issued a joint statement on Thursday, strongly condemning the demonstrators' attempt to continue disturbances at the airport and appealing to the public not to participate in the illegal activities.
The demonstrators' earlier storming and besiege of the airport has inflicted immeasurable losses on the Hong Kong International Airport's reputation and business, the statement said, criticizing the demonstrators for their extremely selfish act of damaging the livelihood of large numbers of airport employees."
Demonstration staged in Hong Kong against U.S. interference in China's domestic affairs,"HONG KONG, Aug. 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 people held a demonstration on Monday in front of the U.S. Consulate General in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to protest against the U.S. interference in China's domestic affairs.
The demonstrators, holding up Chinese national flags and banners high and chanting slogans, started in the afternoon from Chater Garden in the Central district and headed for the U.S. consulate general.
""We are building Hong Kong, while the mobs are destroying it, and there are ghosts behind the mobs,"" Tsao Tat-ming, who initiated the demonstration, said as he pointed at the United States as the ""black hand"" behind the recent escalation of violent acts in Hong Kong.
The demonstration, participated by members of several local groups, was aimed at ""strongly condemning the United States for its gross interference in China's domestic affairs,"" Tsao said.
The demonstrators also voiced support for the efforts by the Hong Kong police to maintain the social order amid violent protests.
One of the demonstrators, Kit Yuk-kwan, said the violence and chaos over the past two months have badly impacted the transport, tourism as well as people's life in Hong Kong.
""Hong Kong, as an international cosmopolitan, should settle the disputes through negotiations in a civilized and peaceful, rather than a violent way,"" she said."
Interview: Violence in Hong Kong should stop immediately: Thai business leader,"BANGKOK, Sept. 13 (Xinhua) -- Violent protests in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region should be stopped immediately, Jitti Tangsithpakdi, president of the Thai-Chinese Chamber of Commerce, told Xinhua recently.
Jitti said during an interview that he travels to Hong Kong several times every year and truly sees Hong Kong as ""Pearl of the Orient.""
Jitti said he could never imagine such violent protests would take place in Hong Kong.
""I think there are outsiders orchestrating behind,"" he said, adding that those ""outsiders"" deliberately instigated conflicts and violence.
""The violent protests affected business, tourism and the overall economy, and would lead Hong Kong to a very bad situation,"" he said.
""I was there at the ceremony when Hong Kong returned to the motherland in 1997. I was so glad that finally Chinese people could manage Hong Kong by themselves,"" he said.
Those behind the scenes just wanted to divide Chinese people, he said, adding that the violent protesters should not be used as the tools to destroy their own home.
""If Hong Kong is devastated, you will gain nothing,"" Jitti said.
""It is quite clear that the 'one country, two systems' principle is very successful. I think the international community should condemn those who orchestrated these violent protests. They are really ill-intended,"" he added."
Woman representatives say to bring truth about Hong Kong to UN,"GENEVA, Sept. 10 (Xinhua) -- Woman representatives from the Chinese city of Hong Kong said earlier on Tuesday that they will bring the truth about Hong Kong as well as what the average Hong Kong people think about the local situation to the United Nations.
Pansy Ho Chiu-king, chairperson of the Hong Kong Federation of Women (HKFW), and Annie Wu Suk-ching, advisor to the HKFW, made the remarks Tuesday before attending the 42nd session of the UN Human Rights Council.
They are scheduled to brief the session on the situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of China, which has seen nearly three months of protests with violence by radical demonstrators and a large number of arrests made by police.
Protests still continue in Hong Kong even after the HKSAR government announced on Sept. 4 that it will formally withdraw the proposed amendments to an extradition law.
Ho said Hong Kong's existing legal framework allows as many as possible peaceful ways for people to voice their sentiments and demands, and the escalated violence in the protests ""has almost ruined everything of the established international image of Hong Kong.""
Violent acts such as vandalizing facilities to block the subway traffic and paralyze the airport operation have not only tarnished the image of Hong Kong, but also disrupted the economic activities and people's daily life, Wu told reporters.
Ho said it is the average residents and the small businesses who bear the brunt of the chaos and tensions in Hong Kong.
""I want to ask this question: When you use the freedom to express your thoughts, are you aware of the rights for other people to live a tranquil life?"" she said.
""After all, Hong Kong's affairs are the internal affairs of our own country, and people from all walks of life should make concerted efforts to find a solution in order that Hong Kong will not be reduced to a political tool,"" Ho noted.
Ho also praised the maximum restraint exerted by the Hong Kong police in dealing with protestors.
In the past months, Hong Kong police often faced personal assaults while almost working around the clock, Ho said, adding that such a situation, unprecedented in Hong Kong, has made many local inhabitants dare not go out.
On reporting on Hong Kong's situation at the session of the UN Human Rights Council, Ho said that she, herself as a woman leader, businesswoman and public figure, has the responsibility to do her utmost for Hong Kong's future.
""I'm willing to speak for Hong Kong to have a peaceful and tolerant society,"" said Wu, who is also a well-known businesswoman in Hong Kong."
"U.S. congressman's remarks on Hong Kong ""double standard"": Chinese FM spokesperson","BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Monday said some European and American people are abiding by double standards by shielding rioters in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and turning a blind eye to their violence and illegal acts.
Spokesperson Hua Chunying's remarks came as Eliot L. Engel, chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said that he was ""deeply concerned by the reports of police brutality in response to peaceful protests in Hong Kong,"" and that ""allegations of police violence over the past weeks have tarnished Hong Kong's international reputation for good governance and the fair administration of justice.""
Hua expressed her doubts on Engel's comments and said he has ""turned white to black"" and ""confused right and wrong.""
""How can some Americans use the words 'peaceful protests' when seeing violent protesters storm the Legislative Council Complex and besiege the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR, not to mention the organized assault on police by lethal weapons?"" Hua asked.
She recalled a resolution passed by the European Parliament earlier this year which stressed that demonstrations and freedom of expression, which are not without limits, must be exercised within the law and subject to police enforcement restrictions.
Hua also said during the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011, the New York authorities intensified police by gathering policemen from eight cities, deploying explosion-proof vehicle, riot squads, snipers and horse teams and using weapons such as electric batons and taser guns.
Saying the U.S. police have repeatedly mentioned force must be used when there is any threat to the lives of the officers, Hua wonders if officers in Washington D.C. and New York were assaulted in the same way as those in the HKSAR, what the U.S. police would do.
She reiterated that the central government firmly supports the HKSAR government in exercising effective governance and the police there in punishing lawless and violent acts in accordance with the law, so as to safeguard long-term stability, development and prosperity of the city.
All people with a sense of justice and all citizens who truly love Hong Kong should make joint efforts for Hong Kong's long-term peace and stability, Hua added."
"Violence in China's Hong Kong is ""criminal activity,"" not acceptable in any country: Malaysian expert","KUALA LUMPUR, Aug. 29 (Xinhua) -- The violence that has gripped China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) is a ""criminal activity"" and will not be tolerated in any place, said a Malaysian expert.
The recent protests in Hong Kong ""are not just protests"" but involved ""a lot of hooliganism and vandalism,"" said Bunn Nagara, Senior Fellow of the Institute of Strategic and International Studies, Malaysia.
""It is criminal activity because laws have been broken; people including the police have been attacked and both public and private property has been damaged, including cars on the road,"" Nagara told Xinhua in a recent interview.
If people want to express their opinions, they should do it peacefully and through proper channels. ""But going by not just demonstrations but criminal activity like vandalism,"" it's not the way that can be accepted anywhere in the world, he said.
Nagara also noted that the allegations of Hong Kong police being violent against protestors are unjustified.
""It is totally unjustified because the police in Hong Kong should match at least the level of threat posed by the violent demonstrators,"" he said.
He expressed the hope that Hong Kong people will make efforts to bring the situation back to normal. ""If the protests are not stopped early, they will grow more and more widespread and more and more violent and that becomes much more difficult to control,"" he said.
""One country, two systems"" has been working very well since Hong Kong's return to its motherland in 1997, Nagara said, adding, ""It has worked so far. Why disrupt it, why want to change it at all?""
He also pointed out that the practice of using Hong Kong to distract China as well as to weaken its position by certain elements is ""unfair and very unethical,"" which lead to the people in Hong Kong suffer as a result."
"1,453 people arrested over violence in Hong Kong since June: police","HONG KONG, Sept. 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police said on Monday that a total of 1,453 people, aged between 12 and 72, have been arrested in violent protests in Hong Kong since June 9.
Tse Chun-chung, chief superintendent of Hong Kong Police Public Relations Branch, said at a press briefing on Monday that a large number of rioters ignored the police's objection and assembled illegally in Admiralty, Wan Chai, Causeway Bay and North Point in Hong Kong Island on Sunday.
The rioters blocked roads recklessly, leading to a traffic gridlock, and some of them even burnt a national flag and committed other severe behaviors, disturbing public orders, Tse said, adding that the rioters also blocked many metro stations and set fire at the exits, posing serious threats to the safety of the public.
At around 5:00 p.m. local time on Sunday, rioters started to throw bricks and hard objects into different government buildings. ""They threw over 80 petrol bombs at civilians, police officers and public properties. Even the specialized crowd management vehicle was set on fire,"" Tse said.
On Sunday afternoon, two police officers in Wan Chai came under attack of petrol bombs thrown by around 20 rioters. The two decisively held up their revolvers to protect themselves. Tse stressed that the acts of the officers was justified and effective in dispersing the rioters.
Apart from extensive road blockage and mass destruction of government properties and public facilities, many rioters harshly assaulted people who were not on their side. After beating up innocent people, the rioters obstructed the ambulance staff to treat the injured, he added.
""The rioters certainly had no consideration for the livelihood of ordinary citizens. The police strongly condemn all acts of violence and we will definitely bring all offenders to justice,"" Tse said."
"Roundup: Violence, chaos in Hong Kong not in interests of local residents -- Sudanese analysts","KHARTOUM, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese political analysts believe acts of violence and chaos by saboteurs in Hong Kong do not serve the interests of the residents in the special administrative region of China but to undermine the local stability.
""It is apparent that the developments in Hong Kong have gone beyond their nature of peaceful demanding protests to become organized acts of violence and chaos,"" Abdel-Rahim Al-Sunni, a political analyst, told Xinhua.
He accused unnamed countries and groups of making use of peaceful protest, adding the political groups in Hong Kong should be vigilant against an escalation of the situation.
In the eyes of Hasan Al-Saouri, a professor of political science at the Al Nelain University, the situation in Hong Kong may have an impact on China.
""Hong Kong's affairs are part of the purely internal affairs of China, what happens in the administrative region will have consequences for China,"" said Al-Saouri.
Abdul-Khaliq Mahjoub, a political expert, warned against ill-grounded foreign intervention.
""Some countries did not hide support for the negative developments in Hong Kong, while others are publicly seeking to ignite tension in the region with the belief that the move would weaken China,"" he said.
He noted that the entire world must be aware that the tension in the region would not benefit any party, stressing the importance to end the violence and restore stability to Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong authorities have so far made arrests over assaulting police, taking part in riot, possessing offensive weapons, and unlawful assembly among other charges, during clashes between violent protesters and police."
"No compromise with ""black sheep"" attempting to disrupt Hong Kong's social order: Tung Chee-hwa","HONG KONG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee-hwa, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said here Wednesday that continuous turmoil and violence have severely damaged Hong Kong's rule of law and business environment, while also spoiling the confidence of the international community in Hong Kong and even the relationship between the mainland and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
At a lunch meeting organized by Our Hong Kong Foundation, a think tank he founded and chairs, Tung said that he believed there might be foreign forces behind the storm, given the scale of the protests and the savvy way they have been organized.
Some foreign politicians, those anti-China elements in particular, have always harbored the ulterior motives of turning Hong Kong into a battle field to damage the relationship between the mainland and the SAR.
""Hong Kongers shall by no means be used by them,"" said the former chief executive of the SAR.
He was confident that Hong Kong people will support the SAR government and the police in upholding the rule of law and taking decisive measures to restore social order.
Tung said that there should be no compromise with those ""black sheep"" who disrupted Hong Kong's social order and attempted to tear Hong Kong apart.
He urged the SAR government to swiftly tackle long-standing social issues and firmly uphold the principles of ""one country, two systems,"" ""Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong"" and a high degree of autonomy.
Tung called on Hong Kong people to maintain confidence in Hong Kong and the whole country.
Should we keep our confidence, inclusiveness and perseverance, Hong Kong people, with our wit and courage, can definitely ride the waves forward towards long-term stability and prosperity, said Tung."
Business people worry turmoil erodes Hong Kong's cornerstone of success,"HONG KONG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Business people have expressed their worries that the recent turmoil happened in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) will erode the foundation to Hong Kong's success, hoping the society could get back on the right track as soon as possible.
Joseph Yam, member of the Executive Council of the HKSAR and former chief executive of Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said that the rule of law is the cornerstone of success of Hong Kong as an international financial hub. The series of violent acts and vandalism are affecting the economic order in Hong Kong and disrupting normal business.
""Although the performance of Hong Kong's financial market is normal at the moment, it is hard to say the confidence of investors and financial institutions will not be impacted in the future if the turmoil continues,"" Yam said, adding that violent disorders will gradually erode Hong Kong's foundation.
Chief Executive of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited Charles Li said that Hong Kong has always been a safe place and it is not fair for the whole public in Hong Kong to bear the consequences caused by violent extremists.
Li stressed that Hong Kong has freedom of speech, assembly and media, with the precondition that no violence should be used. Hong Kong people are worried about their personal safety which is heart-wrenching, he said, hoping the society will not head to an irretrievable path.
The negative impacts of these violent incidents on Hong Kong have emerged. The Standard Chartered Bank recently downgraded the economic growth forecast for 2019 of Hong Kong from 2.2 percent to 1.4 percent.
According to the Hong Kong Retail Management Association, large-scale rallies and protests have dampened Hong Kong's retail performance, with most of the members of the association recording a double-digit fall in business in the first week of June and July.
The Hong Kong Productivity Council recently announced the third quarter result of the ""Standard Chartered Hong Kong SME Leading Business Index."" Compared with last quarter, the index of this quarter decreased by 7 points to 39 and reached its three-year low, indicating a significant drop in SMEs' confidence in the business environment.
Yang Yuchuan, chief macroeconomist of Prime China Securities Limited, said the current situation of Hong Kong has already weighed on tourism and retail industries. Unstable society and worsened business environment can cause a decrease in economic activities in Hong Kong, which in turn will have negative impacts on trading, logistics and financial services.
""As a center of international finance, shipping, trade, tourism, and shopping, Hong Kong needs to keep a stable, secure and orderly environment for its society and economy,"" said Hong Kong Association of China Business Chairman Ping Wong.
Echoing Wong, Ngan Po-ling, deputy chairman of Hong Kong Mainland Headwear Holdings Ltd., appealed Hong Kong citizens to resist violence which have affected the daily life. ""Violent acts these days have enraged we business community. We can't let Pearl of the Orient suffer these,"" said Ngan.
Many of those interviewed called for focus on economy and people's livelihood. They believed Hong Kong citizens, young people in particular, will embrace more opportunities brought by the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the Belt and Road Initiative.
""Stability is a major premise of developing a strong economy. I hope Hong Kong could end the turmoil and go back on track, to rebuild a commerce-friendly environment and explore more opportunities for companies and residents,"" said Edward Liu, a lawyer specialized in shipping.
Ronald Wan, a senior investment banker, said Hong Kong enjoys apparent development strengths and solid base to maintain its status as a center of international finance, shipping and trade with the central government's support and stable environment.
Wan hoped that the whole society could calm down and Hong Kong citizens especially the youth could grasp opportunities for a brighter future."
"Smoothly functioning commerce in Hong Kong ""fundamentally important"": AmCham China","HONG KONG, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- An influential U.S. business group in China said that ""smoothly functioning commerce"" in Hong Kong is ""fundamentally important"" to the business interests of its members, a Hong Kong newspaper has reported.
Timothy Stratford, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in China, said ""it is without question that smoothly functioning Hong Kong commerce is fundamentally important to our members' business interests and an important validator of the 'one country, two systems' approach,"" the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported Friday.
The remarks came as business in Hong Kong faced disruptions due to continued street protests over the past weeks.
A straw poll in late July, which surveyed 1,400 members of the AmCham Hong Kong, a sister organization of the AmCham China, showed that 37.1 percent of the respondents were ""pessimistic"" in the short-term over Hong Kong's prospects and 34.4 percent believed that the city's ""long-term prospects have been irreparably damaged,"" according to the SCMP.
The Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB) also appealed for calm on Friday night.
""The HKAB calls on members of the public to stop all violent acts and to resolve differences through dialogues,"" the business group said. ""We also hope that the Hong Kong community will return to calm and peace soon.""
AmCham China is the only officially recognized chamber of commerce representing U.S. businesses in Chinese mainland, which gathers more than 3,300 individual members from 900 companies."
Extreme violence pushing Hong Kong to very dangerous situation: HKSAR chief executive,"HONG KONG, Aug. 5 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam on Monday said at a press conference that a spate of extremely violent incidents have been pushing Hong Kong to a very dangerous situation.
Lam called on Hong Kong citizens to express demands in a peaceful manner and not to undermine Hong Kong's future of prosperity and stability. The press conference was also attended by other senior officials of the HKSAR government.
Noting that Hong Kong has gone through chaos over the past two months and violence has made it more difficult to resolve problems, Lam said that freedom is Hong Kong's core value; some radicals' violent expression of demands has come at the expense of others' freedom and rights.
The misdeeds of some radicals, including defacing the national emblem and flinging the national flag into the sea, are challenges to state sovereignty, and will jeopardize the ""one country, two systems"" and Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, Lam said.
Lam said Hong Kong has been one of the safest cities in the world, but in the past two weeks, the protests in Hong Kong have escalated into a spate of violent incidents, in which some radical protesters assaulted police officers and commited arson and vandalism, among other serious law violations.
The radicals also blocked roads, held up public transport and instigated strike, disrupting the normal life of Hong Kong residents, she added.
""Hong Kong's future and the stable life of over seven million people shouldn't be put at stake,"" said Lam, adding that social security and stability cannot be restored soon once broken.
As the situation is developing fast with repercussions across different sectors, Lam said the police force will hold press conference on a daily basis starting Monday and the HKSAR government will also hold trans-department press conference according to needs.
Hong Kong's economy is facing grim challenges and tremendous downward pressure, said Financial Secretary Paul Chan, adding that recent violent incidents have also taken a toll on Hong Kong's catering, hospitality, tourism and retail sectors.
Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung also called on Hong Kong citizens to fulfill job duty, saying strike and violence would disrupt people's daily lives and inflict damage to the city's economy."
"Xinhua Headlines: Protesters cause mayhem as HKSAR chief executive warns of ""very dangerous situation""","HONG KONG, Aug. 5 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's transport network was partially paralyzed on Monday as protesters brought fresh chaos.
Metro commuters were seriously affected by protesters, as many lines suspended operations.
At Fortress Hill metro station, black-clad people repeatedly blocked train car doors, causing the suspension of operation. ""No nonsense. We want to go to work. Leave us alone,"" said a middle-aged commuter, confronting a black-clad radical.
The metro system in Hong Kong transports about 5.8 million passengers a day.
A husband who moved his pregnant wife out of a train car cried out: ""Don't you ever come close to a pregnant woman. Call the ambulance, now!""
Footages aired by local broadcasters also showed motorists angrily accusing radicals of blocking traffic on the city's main avenues.
Flights were canceled at Hong Kong International Airport, one of the busiest airports in the world.
A passenger surnamed Woo said he was unable to fly to Japan as planned.
""It is very selfish for some people to hurt the interests of the vast majority of residents in the name of so-called democracy,"" Woo said.
More Hong Kong residents decided that they would go to work anyway and were not bothered by leaving home one or two hours in advance to avoid traffic disturbances.
""I have a very simple demand today -- that is to go to work no matter what,"" a resident surnamed Lai told local media.

""VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION""
Weeks of protests in Hong Kong escalated into a spate of violent incidents, which saw some radicals assault police officers and commit arson and vandalism, among other serious law violations.
At a press conference, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Carrie Lam warned that extreme violence is pushing Hong Kong to a ""very dangerous situation.""
She urged people to peacefully express their demands and not to destroy the prosperous and stable future of Hong Kong.
Violence would send Hong Kong onto a road with no return, she said.
Lam said radicals' violent expression of demands has come at the expense of others' freedom and rights.
The radicals defaced the Chinese national emblem and flung the national flag into the sea, all these actions have challenged China's sovereignty and undermined the ""one country, two systems"" principle as well as Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, Lam said.
""Hong Kong's future and the lives of its over 7 million people shouldn't be put at stake,"" Lam said, calling for the peaceful expression of demands from Hong Kong residents.

ORDER, ORDER, ORDER
Calls for peace and order were mounting among ordinary Hong Kong residents.
A fruit stand owner surnamed Suen complained that few people came to buy fruits on Monday.
""I hope the situation is temporary and will subside as soon as possible,"" Suen said. ""The government should not give in. The radicals reach out for a yard after taking an inch.""
""Local people hung out less as transport became less convenient, and tourists dare not come to Hong Kong as they are afraid of the social chaos,"" said a pharmacy store owner on Hennessy Road surnamed Ho who wished the radicals would go home and leave ordinary residents alone.
""Otherwise, we are paying the price for what they did,"" she said.
Gary Lee and his wife kept their tiny restaurant open throughout Monday.
""Of course we are worried, but we need to do business. We have got rent to pay,"" said Lee's wife. ""We want our old, normal days back."""
Spotlight: Continued violence worries many in Hong Kong,"HONG KONG, July 27 (Xinhua) -- ""In all my 48 years in Hong Kong, I have never seen it in such a mess,"" Allan Zeman, chairman of Lan Kwai Fong Holdings Ltd., said in his office on the 17th floor of a high-rise in central Hong Kong.
Lying next to the building, Lan Kwai Fong, the city's landmark central bars and entertainment district, was packed with people ranging from white-collars working nearby to tourists attracted by its fame. But Zeman, known as ""Father of Lan Kwai Fong,"" could hardly be happy.
During the past few weeks, Hong Kong has seen intensified acts of violence, as some radical protestors stormed the Legislative Council (LegCo) building, besieged the building of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and even defaced the national emblem.
""This is crossing the line and is a terrible disrespect in any country,"" said Zeman, who was born in Germany and raised in Canada.
Zeman was not the only one worrying about the situation in Hong Kong. As extreme incidents lingered, the anxiety was on the rise from not only locals but also the people from the rest of the world who now live and work in Hong Kong.
""I'm worried about the violence that is taking place in Hong Kong, because I have lived here all my life and it has never been violent,"" said Avais Ahmad, owner of a Persian carpet shop in Wan Chai district in Hong Kong Island.
Ahmad, 48, was born and raised in Hong Kong and has built up a strong sense of belonging to this place. ""My grandfather moved here from Pakistan in 1952 and then my father followed. Hong Kong is my home and I very much love it,"" he said.
""I think a lot of people take for granted what we have in Hong Kong. We need to respect the law. We need to respect what Hong Kong has offered. We all need to work together, not against each other,"" Ahmad said.
Ahmad's view was echoed by Bruce, who works for a finance company. Coming from the United States and having worked in Hong Kong for five years, he said the violence should not escalate any more.
He said the problem should be solved through dialogue, adding that the instability, if persist, will be no good for anyone.
The recent violence has also cast a shadow over the economy as quite a few industries have felt the pinch. Retailers and companies from the tourism sector were the first to take the brunt, with double-digit slumps expected.
Ahmad's shop was not an exception and he believed the protests and external trade tension combined have bitten into the turnover.
""Our business revenue has gone down very much compared to the same time last year, and there has been a decline of almost 30 to 40 percent,"" he said. ""People are just not in the same mind frame to spend money or to give priority to shopping as such.""
An Indian tourist who declined to be named said he came to Hong Kong for a five-day trip on his own as his friends changed their mind before setting off. ""I also started to be a little bit worried as I read news about the violence all over the internet.""
Zeman was afraid that the impact may expand to more sectors and even to the entire economy.
""Business people like stability. If not only tourism but the broader service industry is disrupted, the trust will be broken and money will go to other places, with Hong Kong being bypassed,"" he said. ""And so the economy will really suffer.""
Zeman said his foreign friends have already been very nervous about what is going on in Hong Kong as the violence presents a very bad image to the world.
Bruce said he has enjoyed working and living in Hong Kong because of its safety, openness and freedom to do business, as well as being an important gateway to Asia, and in particular the Chinese market. ""I hope the problem can be resolved as soon as possible,"" he said."
Hong Kong airport resumes operations with over 200 flights still cancelled,"HONG KONG, Aug. 13 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong International Airport resumed operations on Tuesday, a day after all flights were cancelled due to a protest.

Yang Guang, spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks on the recent protests and violent incidents in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) at a press conference in Beijing.
Noting that development is the right path for solving problems in Hong Kong, the spokesperson stressed that if the disorder persists, the entire society of Hong Kong will have to ""cover the cost.""
Yang said the HKSAR government and the whole society should take more effective measures in promoting economic development and improving people's livelihoods, especially in helping young people tackle difficulties in housing, education, employment and starting businesses.

"Commentary: Timely end of chaos in Hong Kong key to protecting its economic, social foundations","BEIJING, Aug. 13 (Xinhua) -- Radicalized protests and escalating violence in Hong Kong have weighed down the Asian financial hub and compromised the well-being of its 7 million residents.
Hong Kong International Airport is the latest to suffer. The airport, which normally handles nearly 200,000 passengers a day, has been disturbed by unauthorized protests, resulting in a large number of flights canceled.
The illegal gathering also caused serious traffic jams along the expressways around the airport and affected the commutes of local residents.
Carrying weapons, smashing facilities, setting fires, blocking main streets and harassing passers-by, wherever the radicals have ventured, streets lie deserted, with shops closed and destruction in their wake. The scenes bear little resemblance to the dynamic and cosmopolitan Hong Kong of recent memory.
The damage has begun to show. Hong Kong's gross domestic product in the second quarter increased by only 0.6 percent in real terms year on year with the three sectors of catering, tourism and retailing hit the hardest.
Visitor arrivals and the hotel occupancy rate reported double-digit reductions in July and tourism business operators had their average revenue drop by almost 80 percent in the past two months year on year.
These scenes, so unbearable to anyone with love for Hong Kong, are exactly what the radicals and their behind-the-scenes string-pullers desire.
By taking a look at the regions around the world that underwent ""color revolutions"" instigated by Western forces, one sees case after case of civil war, social disorder, ethnic conflict and human suffering.
This cannot become the future of Hong Kong!
An increasing number of Hong Kong residents have broken their silence by standing against violence and voicing their support for the rule of law. They have expressed the Hong Kong people's common will that the chaos can last no longer.
It is the common aspiration of the Hong Kong people to stop violence and the chaos, so that Hong Kong can restore order and return to prosperity and harmony. Anyone who harms the city will surely be severely punished by law and condemned by the people."

""We are here to support the police in strictly enforcing the law, getting rid of bullies and bringing peace to law-abiding people,"" Chow added.
Jack Shun, a friend of Chow, said that he was very angry about the illegal rallies and protests that took place over the weekend.
""Why did those violent protesters throw bricks to the police? We have had enough! We don't want to see the police get hurt,"" Shun said indignantly, adding that he wanted to see Hong Kong stay stable and prosperous.

Po praised the police for taking appropriate actions promptly to restore order when facing violence by arresting some violent protesters.
""We will continue to support the police in enforcing the law strictly and arresting those opposition legislators who have been instigating the youth to stage illegal protests and commit violence,"" Po said.
Retired Hong Kong resident Yiu Wing Wah were among a group of people at the police headquarters, presenting placards with slogans including ""well done!"", ""keep it up!"" and ""protect Hong Kong"" to express support for the police.
""We are here to express our consolation for the police and to show support for them in continuing to enforce the law and maintain the order and security of Hong Kong,"" Yiu said.
""Our demand is very simple, that is to see stability and prosperity in Hong Kong, and no more damage,"" the 74-year-old said, adding that the violent protesters blocked the roads and disrupted normal businesses, which not only damaged the rule of law, but also affected Hong Kong's economy.

Central government closely following HK situation: spokesperson,"BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The central government has been closely following the development of the situation in Hong Kong, a spokesperson said.
Yang Guang, spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks on the recent protests and violent incidents in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, at a press conference held in Beijing on Monday."
Radical protests dragging Hong Kong into danger: spokesperson,"BEIJING, Aug. 6 (Xinhua) -- The radical protests in Hong Kong, which have continued for nearly two months, have severely impacted the region's prosperity and stability and are pushing it into a ""dangerous abyss,"" a central government spokesperson said Tuesday.
The protests in the recent two months have gone beyond the freedom of assembly, demonstration or protest and escalated into extremely violent acts, said Yang Guang, spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, at a press conference."
Commissioner's office of China's foreign ministry in Hong Kong criticizes U.S. congressman's remarks on Hong Kong police,"HONG KONG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A spokesperson of the Office of the Commissioner of China's Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Sunday deplored and firmly opposed the false remarks by a U.S. congressman on Hong Kong police's handling of recent protests.
Eliot L. Engel, chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, has said that he was ""deeply concerned by the reports of police brutality in response to peaceful protests in Hong Kong"" and that ""allegations of police violence over the past weeks have tarnished Hong Kong's international reputation for good governance and the fair administration of justice.""
The spokesperson said in a statement that since the return of Hong Kong, China's central government has been committed to the principles of ""one country, two systems,"" ""Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong"" and a high degree of autonomy in the HKSAR in strict accordance with the constitution and the Basic Law. As a result, Hong Kong has maintained prosperity and stability, and Hong Kong people enjoy unprecedentedly extensive rights and freedoms.
Hong Kong ranked the 16th for its rule of law performance in 2018, which was higher than that of the United States, while it ranked below 60th in 1996, said the spokesperson.
""These are undeniable facts. So what right do American politicians have to criticize human rights, freedoms and the rule of law of Hong Kong?"" the spokesperson said, adding that the U.S. politicians have never spoken out against the absence of human rights and freedoms in Hong Kong during the period when Hong Kong was under colonial rule, nor showed concern about the status and situation of Hong Kong people back then.
Now the U.S. politicians are pointing fingers at Hong Kong that enjoys unprecedented rights and freedoms, and alleging that the Chinese government continues to chip away at its freedoms and rights.
""Isn't this bare-faced lying and typical double standard?"" the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson stressed that the rule of law is a core value of Hong Kong society and a cornerstone of its success. It is widely recognized that the SAR government has been committed to law-based governance since the return of Hong Kong and that the rule of law here continues to improve.
By proposing to amend the two ordinances related to fugitive offenders in accordance with law, the SAR government aims to plug the loophole in the existing legal system and uphold social justice. The legislative procedure proceeded in accordance with law, and the amendments are in line with international law and common practices. It is, therefore, a just and reasonable effort that champions and helps improve the rule of law in Hong Kong, the spokesperson said.
When controversy arose, the SAR government announced suspending the legislative exercise so as to listen more extensively to various sectors of society and restore calm and reason to society, which reflects how much it respects public opinion and commits itself to law-based governance, the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson pointed out that violence cannot be justified by any demands. Some radicals in Hong Kong have run amok, who flagrantly stormed and vandalized the Legislative Council (LegCo) building, assaulted and even brutally bit off a finger of a police officer, stormed an institution of the central government in Hong Kong, and defaced the national emblem. Such astonishing violent and illegal acts seriously trample upon the rule of law in Hong Kong, gravely undermine public order and security, and openly challenge the red line of ""one country, two systems,"" the spokesperson said.
Instead of admitting that some protesters are indeed radical, however, some U.S. politicians and individual media insist that their protests were peaceful, accuse the Hong Kong police of brutality and call on the SAR government to uphold its commitment. ""Isn't this mudslinging against their own conscience?"" the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson said that anyone without bias would acknowledge that the Hong Kong police have exercised great restraint and showed admiring professionalism in dealing with violence and deliberate provocation by rioters. Over the past few days, some citizens in New York poured water on local police officers, which was condemned at all levels from the U.S. president to the mayor and to the police as ""completely unacceptable.""
""So why do some Americans once and again connive at the extreme violent and anti-law acts by radicals in Hong Kong to storm and vandalize the LegCo building, assault the police and bite off an officer's finger, storm the central government institution and deface the national emblem?"" said the spokesperson.
The spokesperson emphasized that China's central government firmly supports Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the SAR government in law-based governance, and the Hong Kong police in fulfilling their duties to protect public order and security in accordance with law. It firmly opposes any attempts by foreign governments, organizations or individuals to interfere with Hong Kong affairs and undermine the SAR's prosperity and stability.
""We again urge some foreign politicians to immediately stop sending out wrong signals on violent illegal acts, immediately stop saying or doing anything that smears 'one country, two systems' and undermines Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and China's domestic affairs as a whole,"" the spokesperson said."
Xinhua Headlines: Protesters paralyze airport as HKSAR chief executive appeals for end to violence,"HONG KONG, Aug. 13 (Xinhua) -- Protesters created chaos at the Hong Kong International Airport for the second day on Tuesday, causing cancellations of most outbound flights at one of the busiest airports in the world.
All check-in services for departure flights were suspended starting at 4:30 p.m., the Airport Authority Hong Kong said in a statement after protesters occupied the airport terminal and prevented passengers from departing.
Footage aired by a local broadcaster showed some protesters grab passengers' arms, preventing them from passing through checkpoints.
As of 3 p.m., 188 arriving and 182 departing flights scheduled on Tuesday had been canceled due to the protests, according to the airport authority.
It was the second day of chaos at the airport caused by protests, leaving many stranded passengers visibly annoyed.
""Unfortunately with the chaos, we are stuck here in the airport,"" said a Filipino passenger named Bennet. ""No food and no drinks at all. Most of the restaurants are closed.""
A passenger from the Chinese mainland said she considered flying from Shenzhen instead. ""I don't know when this will end,"" she said.
""They (protesters) are damaging Hong Kong's business environment and image,"" said the passenger surnamed Gao. ""I love Hong Kong, but I feel sorry for those young people who have been incited and used.""

A HEAVY PRICE
Frank Chan Fan, secretary for transport and housing of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government, said paralyzing the airport will make Hong Kong ""pay a heavy price.""
""Amid fierce regional competition, it is very easy to destroy years of achievements the airport has accomplished, but rebuilding them would be very hard,"" Chan said.
In 2018, the Hong Kong airport handled an average of 200,000 travelers each day, while trade via air accounted for nearly half of Hong Kong's total trade volume.
In a joint statement on Tuesday, seven labor unions in the aviation industry of Hong Kong condemned the unpermitted demonstrations that have stained the international reputation of Hong Kong.
The unions urged the protesters to stop all unlawful demonstrations and refrain from ""gambling at the expense of Hong Kong's economic pillar.""
On Tuesday, HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the most urgent task now is to stop violence and safeguard the rule of law to prevent Hong Kong from sinking into ""an abyss where it will be smashed to pieces.""
Lam said some people, in the name of freedom or justice, have been committing vandalism and damaging the rule of law, throwing Hong Kong into a state of panic.
If violence persists, it will take a long time to restore the openness, freedom, inclusiveness and economic stability in Hong Kong, and the stable lives of seven million residents can not continue, Lam said.
RETAIL, TOURISM BADLY HIT
Weeks of protests and violent incidents have dented Hong Kong's retail, catering and tourism sectors, a key part of the local economy.
Business owners and industry insiders expressed growing worries as endless and ever-escalating violence continued to weigh on consumption and deter potential tourists.
""Business has been really bad recently. Sometimes, we don't receive a single guest in hours,"" said Ben Pui, a lobby manager of a hotel located in Sai Wan on Hong Kong Island.
The occupancy rate for Pui's hotel is currently struggling to reach 70 percent, compared with over 90 percent in past summers, despite a drop of room price to 300 HK dollars (38.2 U.S. dollars) from 600.
Visitor arrivals to Hong Kong totaled around 5.14 million in June, dropping by about 770,000 from the figure in May, according to Hong Kong Tourism Board.
Since June, the tourism sector has been hit hard by multiple violent protests, and safety concerns mounted, said Yiu Si-wing, a lawmaker and tourism industry insider, adding that immediate recovery is not likely even if violence ceases soon.
The HKSAR government said earlier this month that the value of total retail sales in June 2019 decreased by 6.7 percent compared with the same month in 2018, as local consumer sentiment turned more cautious and growth in visitor arrivals moderated.
""Every time I heard about a possible protest in the neighborhood, I just closed my shop and took a day off,"" said a Hong Kong resident surnamed Lau, who runs a small clothing shop in the Causeway Bay shopping district.
""With the chaos, people don't want to hang out and buy things. How can I make money?"" Lau said."
Hong Kong public protest against U.S. interference in Hong Kong affairs,"HONG KONG, Aug. 3 (Xinhua) -- Members of the public in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) on Saturday gathered outside the U.S. Consulate General in Hong Kong to protest against the U.S. interference in Hong Kong affairs.
Hundreds of protesters, who came in group in the drizzle, raised banners and placards with slogans expressing their anger, including ""Stop meddling in HK affairs and causing chaos"" and ""Foreign forces have no right to interfere.""
""Give the peaceful life back to the Hong Kong people!"" the crowd chanted.
Some tried to pass letters of protest to the consulate but no one came out to receive the letters.
""We want stability and hope the U.S. side will stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and causing chaos,"" said Mr. Wong, one of the protesters.
""Wanton remarks of the U.S. side and other foreign forces have misled some of the radical youth to violence. Recent protests have severely disrupted Hong Kong residents' daily life,"" said Yeung, another protester.
""The Hong Kong people can handle Hong Kong's affairs, and I believe things will get better,"" he added.
Young people and elderly residents alike joined the protest outside the consulate in Central District of Hong Kong.
An elderly protester surnamed Wong told reporters that he believed foreign forces were behind recent violent incidents.
""Those violent radicals can not represent Hong Kong residents. What we want are stability, prosperity and well-being,"" he said.
Weeks of demonstrations and violent incidents have undermined the rule of law and the social order of Hong Kong, and taken a toll on its retail and tourism sectors.
""The recent incidents have disrupted our life. We can't eat well or sleep well,"" said a female protester surnamed Wong.
""We hope the United States will stop their interference and give a peaceful Hong Kong back to us,"" she said."
"Interview: Violence threatens Hong Kong's stability, rule of law: former senior official of HKSAR gov't","HONG KONG, Aug. 9 (Xinhua) -- Violence is no solution to problems and will only lead to a destabilized Hong Kong society, warned a former senior official of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government.
She called for restoring social order in Hong Kong as soon as possible and focusing on economic development and improvement of people's livelihood.
""Using violent means to achieve goals completely runs contrary to the principle of rule of law,"" Elsie Leung, former Secretary for Justice of the HKSAR government, said in a recent exclusive interview with Xinhua.
Leung made the remarks after weeks of protests in Hong Kong have escalated into a spate of violent incidents, threatening social order and endangering public safety.
From storming and vandalizing the Legislative Council (LegCo) building, storming the institution of the central government in Hong Kong, to paralyzing the transport network and assaulting the police force with bricks and petrol bombs, various actions of the protesters have gone far beyond the realm of peaceful demonstrations, said Leung.
The protesters made more unreasonable demands and escalated their destructive actions even after the SAR government announced suspending the amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance, which only laid bare their true objective of paralyzing Hong Kong and pushing it to anarchy, said Leung.
""No one is above the law,"" she said, stressing that all the offenders should be brought to justice.
""The protesters are repeatedly talking about safeguarding core values of Hong Kong, but what they did completely run contrary to values such as rule of law, democracy, human rights and freedom,"" said Leung.
Rather than resorting to violence, the protesters should follow the legislative procedures and air their view through existing institutional channels, she said.
""Nothing can be achieved and no problem solved in a society full of conflicts and disorder,"" said Leung. ""It should bear in mind that the progress of a society is often incremental and cannot be achieved overnight.""
Leung expressed hope that young people of Hong Kong will make more efforts to learn about the Chinese culture and the national spirit.
""The return of Hong Kong to the motherland entails much more than a change of flag or name,"" Leung said. ""Many Hong Kong people need to embark on a spiritual journey of identifying themselves with the country and their nationality.""
Leung noted that the HKSAR government has made great efforts to improve housing, education and healthcare over the past two years.
""The central government has also done its utmost to create opportunities for young people of Hong Kong through the Belt and Road Initiative and the construction of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area,"" said Leung. ""They should seize these opportunities."""
"Protests, violence take toll on Hong Kong's retail, tourism","HONG KONG, Aug. 2 (Xinhua) -- Weeks of protests and violent incidents have started to dent Hong Kong's retail and tourism sectors, a key part of the economy of the Special Administrative Region (SAR).
Business owners and industry insiders expressed growing worries and uncertainties as the demonstrations and violence continued to weigh on consumption sentiment.
""Protests and violent incidents have forced me to close my shop for several weekends on end,"" said an owner of a seafood store in Sai Wan on the Hong Kong Island, who only gave his surname Cheung. ""Sales have badly dropped and I am losing quite some money.""
Cheung hoped that the demonstrations could end quickly. ""It is important that the economy stays stable. We ordinary residents just want a peaceful life.""
The Hong Kong SAR government said on Thursday that the value of total retail sales in June 2019 decreased by 6.7 percent compared with the same month in 2018, as local consumer sentiment turned more cautious and growth in visitor arrivals moderated.
A government spokesman said the near-term performance of retail sales will likely remain subdued, citing weakened global and local economic outlook and other headwinds.
The spokesman added that the recent demonstrations, if continued, would also dent the retail business further.
According to the Hong Kong Retail Management Association, large-scale rallies and protests have dampened Hong Kong's retail performance, with most of the members of the association recording single or double digit fall since June.
Wong Ka Wo, president of Hong Kong Federation of Restaurant and Related Trades, said weeks of protests have not only hurt visitor arrivals but also dampened consumption of local residents.
""The catering business is very important to Hong Kong. A declining willing to consume will put pressure on businesses and dent Hong Kong's economy,"" said Wong.
Visitor arrivals to Hong Kong totaled around 5.14 million in June, down about 770,000 from the figure in May, according to Hong Kong Tourism Board.
Hong Kong has seen steady tourism volume in the first five months of the year, but since June, the sector has been hit hard by multiple violent protests, and safety concerns mounted, said Yiu Si-wing, a lawmaker and tourism industry insider.
""Many have delayed or even cancelled their trips to Hong Kong,"" he said.
For Hong Kong's tourism sector, immediate recovery is not likely even if violence ceases soon, Yiu said.
But if violence continues, many of the tourism-related industries, including hospitality and retailing, will be hurting, and Hong Kong's overall economy will suffer, he added.
Michael Li, executive director of the Federation of Hong Kong Hotel Owners, said the demonstrations in June have had an impact on Hong Kong's tourism, with the overall hotel occupancy rate dropping about 2 percent.
He estimated that the occupancy rate for hotels near the protest areas in the Hong Kong Island would decrease more than 10 percent in July and those in Kowloon would drop 5 percent to 8 percent."
1st LD-Writethru: Central government closely following HK situation: spokesperson,"BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The central government has been closely following the development of the situation in Hong Kong, a spokesperson said Monday.
Yang Guang, a spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks on the recent protests and violent incidents in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) at a press conference held in Beijing.
He said the HKSAR police have approved and protected, in accordance with the law, peaceful protests related to amending the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance.
However, Yang said, the intentional violent activities by some radical protesters since June 12 went far beyond peaceful demonstrations.
Yang said the protests and violent incidents have lasted for over a month in Hong Kong, severely damaging the rule of law, social order, the economy, people's livelihoods and image of Hong Kong.
""It is heartbreaking for those who love and care about Hong Kong,"" said Yang."
Hong Kong police arrest 149 people during protests in last few days,"HONG KONG, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong police said on Monday that they have arrested 149 people during the series of violent protests over the past few days.
Tang Ping-keung, deputy commissioner of police, said at a press briefing on Monday that during the series of protests, radical protesters acted lawlessly and escalated the level of violence. They have spread the violent acts across Hong Kong, causing serious inconvenience towards the general public's daily life and posing threats to people's safety.
The 149 people, arrested between Aug. 9 and Aug. 12, comprise 111 male and 38 female, aged between 15 to 53. They were suspected of crimes including unlawful assembly, assault on policemen, obstruction of police in the execution of duty, possession of offensive weapons and dangerous objects.
Tang said that on Aug. 11, some people turned a deaf ear to the police's objection and got involved in unauthorized rallies. Some of the protesters later went to different places all over Hong Kong and blocked main roads and thoroughfares, besieged police stations and damaged police vehicles.
In Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon Peninsula, a mob threw petrol bombs into the police station, and the legs of a policeman were burnt by fire consequently.
The police noticed that some protesters were involved in extremely violent activities, and therefore they carried out intelligence-led operations and arrested 15 core members of the mobs on Aug. 11 in Causeway Bay, the Hong Kong Island.
Tang called on protesters to stop using violence to disturb Hong Kong's social order and he hoped that the Hong Kong society can soon restore calm."
1st LD-Writethru: Radical protests dragging Hong Kong into danger: spokesperson,"BEIJING, Aug. 6 (Xinhua) -- The radical protests in Hong Kong, which have continued for nearly two months, have severely impacted the region's prosperity and stability and are pushing it into a ""dangerous abyss,"" a central government spokesperson said Tuesday.
The protests over the past two months have gone beyond the freedom of assembly, demonstration or protest and have escalated into extremely violent acts, said Yang Guang, spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, at a press conference.
""With upgraded means, escalating intensity and aggravating destructiveness, these acts are shocking,"" Yang said.
As of now, 461 people have been injured in violent conflicts, including 139 police officers, according to him.
Yang told the press conference that the protests have seriously affected Hong Kong's economy and people's livelihoods, citing that the region's gross domestic product in the second quarter increased by only 0.6 percent in real terms year on year, and 18 countries and regions have issued travel safety reminders against Hong Kong.
A small number of violent radicals are at the front with some kind-hearted citizens misguided and coerced in the middle, but the masterminds behind the scenes are the anti-China forces in and out of Hong Kong which have been trying to mess up Hong Kong, the spokesperson said.
""They have called black white and spared no efforts in playing up fallacies and absurdities such as the so-called 'civil disobedience' and even the fallacious view that 'only violence can solve problems,'"" he said.
Yang said they have whitewashed and instigated violence, attempting to drag all Hong Kong residents into political wrangling and intensifying social contradictions."
Any attempt to interfere in Hong Kong affairs doomed to fail: FM spokesperson,"BEIJING, Aug. 7 (Xinhua) -- A foreign ministry spokesperson said Wednesday that any attempt to interfere in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs is doomed to fail.
""Any attempt to undermine the 'one country, two systems' and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability will surely be resolutely opposed by all Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots,"" said spokesperson Hua Chunying.
Hua's remarks came when responding to a query about two U.S. senators' comments on the situation in Hong Kong.
She said that the senators had failed to tell right from wrong and spoke nothing about the serious consequences of the radical, violent and illegal behaviors. Instead, they smeared the just actions taken by the Hong Kong police who have all along been professional, highly restrained and committed to safeguarding the rule of law and social order.
The recent protests and demonstrations in Hong Kong have turned into radical violent acts that seriously violate the law, undermine security and social order in Hong Kong, and endanger local people's safety, property and normal life, she said.
""No responsible government would turn a blind eye to such serious violent crimes,"" Hua stressed.
The Chinese side once again urges the relevant American politicians to immediately stop condoning violent crimes and grossly interfering in Hong Kong affairs, she said."
Hong Kong gov't officials denounce violence after protesters cause mayhem,"HONG KONG, Aug. 6 (Xinhua) -- Government officials of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Tuesday called on Hong Kong residents to express firm opposition to violence after radical protesters brought fresh chaos.
On Monday, Hong Kong's transport network was partially paralyzed by protesters, with many metro lines suspending operations and major avenues blocked by barricades.
""Recent protests have become increasingly violent and radical,"" said Chief Secretary for Administration of the HKSAR government Matthew Cheung, adding that Monday's violence in several districts of Hong Kong had posed a threat to public safety.
""Radical protests are pushing Hong Kong to the verge of a dangerous situation,"" said Cheung at a joint press briefing held by various departments of the HKSAR government, calling on residents to say ""no"" to violence as one voice.
The Hong Kong police said on Tuesday that they have arrested 148 people during Monday's operations.
The suspects were arrested for various offenses including unlawful assembly, assaulting police and possession of offensive weapons.
John Lee, secretary for security of the HKSAR government, expressed his thanks to and support for the police force.
The police personnel have been fulfilling their duties of safeguarding security despite tremendous stress, dangerous situations and assaults, said Lee.
A total of 36 roads and the Cross-Harbour Tunnel were blocked by protesters on Monday while 96 bus services were forced to be re-routed or suspended, according to Assistant Commissioner for Transport Candy Kwok.
A total of 21 arson cases were handled Monday as radical protesters used petrol bombs and firebombs to attack police stations and set fire on streets, said Cheng Sui-on, deputy chief fire officer of the Fire Services Department."
"Spotlight: Love Hong Kong and stop hurting it, say ordinary Hong Kong people","HONG KONG, Aug. 19 (Xinhua) -- As protracted violence continue to roil Hong Kong, ordinary Hong Kong people find themselves bearing the brunt of the burden. Concerned about the future of their life and that of their home, more and more are speaking out against violence.
For a hotel room attendant surnamed Wang, the protracted violence could cost her job as a usual summer boom for Hong Kong's tourism industry has turned into a chilly winter due to the unrest.
""Because of a significant falloff in bookings, the hotel asked staff to take leave as soon as possible,"" Wang told Xinhua, adding that if the situation fails to improve after the leave, she will have to take unpaid leave.
Wang said her husband is a taxi driver, and his business has fallen by half since June, when Hong Kong's opposition and some radical forces started to use the pretext of peaceful demonstration to engage in violent protests.
""If I take unpaid leave, my family's earnings will drop to quarter of what it used to be,"" she said.
Currently more than 20 countries and regions have issued travel advisories for Hong Kong over the unrest.
In the June-July period, average earnings for tourism workers plunged by 74 percent, while the number of tours in Hong Kong fell 74 percent on average, according to a survey by the Hong Kong Tour Guides General Union.
The weeks-long violent protests have also taken a toll on small businesses like Wong Pang's logistics company.
As protests dragged on into August, black-clad demonstrators held unlawful assemblies at the Hong Kong International Airport, bringing the region's major transport hub to a grinding halt. The siege of the airport had cost his company a six-figure loss, said Wong.
""By blocking the airport, the subway and the tunnels and calling for strikes, they (violent protesters) seek to disrupt Hong Kong's transport and economy in their own interests,"" said Wong.
""They may claim that they love Hong Kong, but all I can see is their despicable aim to disrupt the economy and hijack the interests of the majority of Hong Kong people,"" he added.
For a Hong Kong resident surnamed Ng, living near a police station used to mean a sense of security. But as radical protesters besiege police stations and attack police officers across Hong Kong, vicinity has incurred suffering.
For days, Ng said, protesters had gathered around the police station till wee hours, throwing bricks at officers and firing laser beams at them.
""I haven't had a sound sleep for days. I hope those protesters will understand that they are dragging down all Hong Kong people with them,"" said Ng. ""But all we need is to live and work peacefully.""
The protests have also sown divisions in the Hong Kong society, pitting friends and family members against each other, said Jackie Cheung, vice president of Federation of Hong Kong Shenzhen Associations.
""Families are divided, with parents and children being unable to communicate with each other. Hong Kong is no longer peaceful,"" Cheung said.
Amid the threats, more and more Hong Kong people are speaking out against violence.
Despite rains, over 470,000 people gathered on Saturday in a rally held at Tamar Park in Hong Kong to voice their demand for peace and stability.
Calling Hong Kong ""always a peaceful society,"" a 57-year-old gardener surnamed Chan expressed his hope that ""the extremist radicals stop violent acts so that people can return to peaceful life.""
A bank staff surnamed Fu said Hong Kong is becoming more and more alien to him nowadays, with many famous tourist sites being painted with aggressive slogans and residents staying at home on weekends out of safety concerns.
""We all love Hong Kong, but I am very sad to see what happened recently,"" said Fu.
""Resorting to force is never an option. It will not help,"" he added. ""I hope the demonstrators would return to reason, put aside violence and bring back a vibrant, peaceful Hong Kong."""

""We came here to stand against the violent riots and the decaying law and order in Hong Kong,"" said Tony Jiang, an Australian citizen of Chinese descent.
""I think those rioters should stop what they are doing and truly talk to the government, not using violence. Talking is the way. Violence is not,"" a female organizer who asked to be referred to as CC told Xinhua.

""We are all Chinese. There is only one China ... We are all brothers and sisters,"" said a Chinese-Australian citizen named Ray.
On Sunday, San Francisco also witnessed overseas Chinese gathering to express their firm objection to violence and strong support for the HKSAR government and Hong Kong police.
Hundreds of overseas Chinese held a peaceful rally at Union Square in downtown San Francisco to support Hong Kong as an indisputable part of China and oppose the violence committed by the rioters in the Chinese special administrative region over the past few weeks.
The participants, mostly young people including students, white-collar workers and business owners, came from different parts of the Bay Area to express their patriotism and zero tolerance of violence by radical protesters in Hong Kong.
Any attempt by some extremists in Hong Kong to promote the so-called ""Hong Kong Independence"" must be opposed, said Vivian Liu, a designer with a local wedding company.
""As a Chinese living outside of China, we have the obligation to come forward to support our own country when those people with ulterior motives are launching a smear campaign against China,"" said Wang Zhonghan, a student at City College of San Francisco.
""How could there be justice when violence is what is exercised, and how could there be freedom when law and order is compromised,"" said Chino Yang, a Chinese American rapper, who is also one of the sponsors of the rally.
On the same day, overseas Chinese and Chinese students in London also attended a rally at noon to voice out their demand for peace and stability in Hong Kong despite bad weather.
""I love Hong Kong, I love China,"" ""One China,"" chanted the crowd in Mandarin, Cantonese and English while holding placards written with slogans including ""Stop Violence"" and ""Save Hong Kong.""

""We speak the same language and keep the same blood. We should unite and make the motherland prosperous and strong,"" he said, voicing their hope to show their patriotism through the rally.
On Sunday afternoon in downtown Boston, hundreds of people gathered at the State House and then marched to Chinatown, waving the Chinese national flag, holding banners, and chorusing the Chinese national anthem and many other Chinese songs to show their backing for solidarity and unity.
""There is no police brutality,"" said overseas Chinese Yu Qicheng during the rally, rejecting rumors spread by some violent protesters of Hong Kong. 
""The brutality has been inflicted on ordinary Hong Kong people and people visiting Hong Kong by those violent protesters,"" he said."
"Roundup: Foreign experts, overseas Chinese condemn violence in Hong Kong","BEIJING, Aug. 21 (Xinhua) -- Violence perpetrated by radical demonstrators in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) over the past few weeks has aroused international concern.
Foreign experts and overseas Chinese have recently expressed their condemnation of the violence in Hong Kong, which has jeopardized the prosperity and stability of the region, urging Western governments to stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs.
""The actions of the demonstrators in Hong Kong have long gone beyond peaceful protest. Normal life is paralyzed. Business in Hong Kong is suffering very big losses,"" said Andrey Ostrovsky, deputy director of Institute of Far Eastern Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Ostrovsky said there are signs indicating that the actions of the radical protesters are being guided from outside.
His remarks were echoed by Khan Mohammad Daneshjo, an Afghan political observer and veteran journalist, who said ""foreign hands"" in Hong Kong are attempting to destabilize China.
""No doubt, the hegemonic powers are behind the violent protests in Hong Kong to undermine investment in the financial hub,"" Daneshjo told Xinhua Tuesday.
Speaking of the recent unlawful assembly at the Hong Kong International Airport, Koh Chin Yee, chief executive officer of Singapore's Longus Research Institute for Development and Strategy, said people in Singapore were shocked and saddened to see what happened at the airport.
""Hong Kong has impressed people for its high degree of freedom and creativity, as well as its good keeping of law and order,"" he said, stressing that the protest ""has gone beyond the limits and has violated the principles of modern civil societies.""
Kyrgyz independent political analyst Edil Osmonbetov also strongly condemned the protests at the airport, saying that external forces interfered in China's internal affairs.
Hong Kong is an indisputable part of China and the Chinese government has the ability to control the situation in Hong Kong, Osmonbetov added.
""The forces who led demonstration behind the scenes have achieved their goal at the expense of Hong Kong people who are not part of these demonstrations,"" said Ajith Dharmawardena, vice president of Sri Lanka-China Buddhist Friendship Association.
Dharmawardena expressed hope that young people who are being misled by foreign forces can return to their senses and stop the ""unwanted demonstrations.""
Ye Fukun, founder and former president of the Chinese Medicine Association of Brazil (AZYMEC), believes the protests are no longer peaceful demonstrations but a ""planned and treacherous outrage,"" which challenges the authority of the Basic Law of the HKSAR.
Overseas Chinese firmly believe in the ""one country, two systems"" principle, support Hong Kong's police, and will not allow the rioters to undermine the city's prosperity and stability, Ye added.
Zhuang Lifeng, president of the Overseas Chinese Association in Bangladesh (OCAB), said the OCAB opposes the violence committed by the rioters in Hong Kong, and condemns some radical protesters' behavior that led the region to chaos."
Feature: Int'l travelers welcome restored order at Hong Kong airport,"HONG KONG, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong International Airport was bustling as usual on Thursday, but white plastic fences erected outside the terminal building and long lines of passengers waiting for check of their flight booking information and ID cards served as a reminder that protesters had disrupted operation of the airport earlier this week.
Robert Fairhead, 66, and his wife Lisa were the witnesses of the illegal, violent rallies at one of world's busiest airport.
The Australian couple sipped coffee on a bench of the arrivals hall Thursday afternoon, waiting for their outbound flight due in the evening. Meters away, a stream of air travelers passed by while a group of uniformed pupils, led by their teachers, were heading for the airport express.
""We have been stranded for two days and can finally back home tonight,"" Fairhead said. They arrived in Hong Kong from Paris on Tuesday and planned to fly to Australia to take care of Robert's 92-year-old mother, who had been hospitalized after falling in home.
However, they came here only to find canceled flights, paralyzed traffic and isolated airport, as the demonstration of thousands of protesters turned violent.
""It is annoying as a lot of innocent people who just happened to be caught up with were pretty badly affected,"" Fairhead said. ""It is difficult for overseas people because it affects us in so many ways with work and family."" Because of the flight cancellation, they paid extra 10,000 Hong Kong dollars (around 1,275 U.S. dollars) for accommodation.
Recent assemblies had seriously disrupted the operation of the airport and threatened the security of both passengers and airport staff.
The Airport Authority Hong Kong started to implement new security measures on Wednesday after nearly 1,000 flights were canceled. Only airport staff and departing passengers with flight tickets or boarding passes for the coming 24 hours and valid travel documents are allowed into the terminals.
Order has been restored. Passengers queued quietly at the check-in counters and uniformed security personnel stood by on the entrance lane. There were no black-clad demonstrators at the airport.
Large display screens showed that most flights arrived and departed normally.
Fairhead and his wife also booked their flight back to Australia on Wednesday shortly after the security measures became effective.
Restaurants and shops, which had received few customers for the past days, witnessed normal business on Thursday. The airport was ranked as the world's top-10 airport for shopping, leisure amenities, dining, airport transit, hotels and airport security, cleanliness and staff services at the annual Skytrax World Airport awards for 2019.
A shopping guide surnamed Fong at a convenience store was busy attending to customers. ""Our business was affected because of the demonstration. As there were a lot of masked people out there, few customers came in and we were also a little bit scared.""
""It's better now and I feel comfortable,"" Fong said. ""It should be like this.""
Luci Bakker arrived in Hong Kong with her son from Bangkok Thursday afternoon and will fly back home in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on Friday after staying for a night in Hong Kong. ""It's good that the airport has resumed from the chaos.""
She and her son had just talked about recent violent protests in Hong Kong. ""Everybody got the right to demonstrate, but don't bother other people. I think that's important. They can demonstrate in certain area, but they don't bother other people who live there.""
""Say what you need, not with fist, but with your mouth,"" Bakker said.
The Hong Kong airport, connecting to over 220 destinations worldwide, handled 74.7 million passengers and 427,700 flights last year."
Chinese mission strongly opposes EU's meddling in Hong Kong affairs,"BRUSSELS, Aug. 18 (Xinhua) -- In response to a statement from EU's top diplomat, a spokesperson of the Chinese Mission to the European Union (EU) said on Sunday that China is gravely concerned and strongly opposed to the EU's meddling in Hong Kong affairs.
EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland issued a joint statement on Hong Kong on Saturday evening.
The statement said that there have recently been a rising number of violent incidents, that engagement in a process of ""broad-based and inclusive dialogue, involving all key stakeholders, is essential.""
""Fundamental freedoms, including the right of peaceful assembly, and Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy under the 'one country, two systems' principle, are enshrined in the Basic Law and in international agreements and must continue to be upheld,"" said the statement.
It must be pointed out that the ""One Country, Two Systems"" is enshrined in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, not international law, the Chinese spokesperson stressed.
The Chinese spokesperson urged the EU side to observe international law and the basic norms governing international relations, respect China's sovereignty in good faith, and immediately stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs, so as not to undermine the sound and steady growth of China-EU relations.
The spokesperson said that the protests and demonstrations in Hong Kong have already evolved into extreme violence. Some radicals ransacked the Legislative Council building, attacked the liaison office of the Central Government and police stations, assaulted the police, committed arson, forced a shutdown of the Hong Kong airport with unauthorized rallies and beat innocent people.
Such moves have jeopardized the safety and security, law and order of Hong Kong society, put Hong Kong citizens' lives, property and normal life in danger, and posed a grave challenge to the red line of ""One Country, Two Systems,"" and must therefore be seriously condemned and strictly dealt with in accordance with law. In face of such severe violence and offences, no government with a sense of responsibility would sit idly by, said the spokesperson.
The Chinese spokesperson reiterated that Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs, which brook no interference by any foreign government or organization. The EU side, in disregard of China's objection, has repeatedly meddled in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs. China is gravely concerned and is strongly opposed to such move."
"Spotlight: Hong Kong tourism workers, retailers paying price for unrest","HONG KONG, Aug. 22 (Xinhua) -- With trip planners turned away from Hong Kong amid recent chaos, ordinary Hong Kong shopkeepers and those working in the tourism industry said that the protracted unrest has taken a major toll on their livelihood.
The summer season from June to August used to be the peak season for Hong Kong tourism. However, a Hong Kong tour guide surnamed Chow said that the summer boom has turned into a chilly winter because of the unrest in Hong Kong.
According to Chow, she usually has 12 to 15 tour groups a month at this time of year, and earns nearly 30,000 Hong Kong dollars (3,823 U.S. dollars) a month in peak season.
However, her business has taken a turn for the worse this summer, with the number of tour groups dropping from eight in June to four in July. So far, she has had no tour group in August.
""I've been a tour guide for more than a decade, and business has never been this bad,"" Chow said, adding that she is worried that she might not have earn a cent in August.
Currently more than 20 countries and regions have issued travel advisories for Hong Kong over the unrest.
""The tourism industry is seasonally based, and many tour guides, like me, count on the summer season to support their families,"" said Chow.
As the new school term is about to commence, Chow said the schooling expenditure would cost a fortune for her family.
""I hope the social order can be restored soon to let ordinary Hong Kong residents live their life,"" said Chow.
For a Hong Kong taxi driver also surnamed Chow, Hong Kong economy has already been battered by the violence and unrest.
""I walked by the pier the day before yesterday, and found that there were hardly any tourists there,"" he said.
The sharp drop in tourist number has affected many industries here, including the taxi business. According to Chow, in the past two months, the daily income of him and other taxi drivers has dropped by 40 percent.
Chow said the destruction of Hong Kong economy and order by the illegal ""Occupy Central"" incident in 2014 left a deep impression on him.
""However, what is happening now is far worse, because the violence is worse,"" said Chow, adding that many taxi drivers have decided to halt their work because ""they are afraid of getting into trouble.""
If the violence and chaos continue, no Hong Kong industry can be spared the pain, said Chow.
""I think the priority is to restore social order and bring to justice those who have disrupted Hong Kong society,"" said Chow.
Weeks-long violent protests have also taken a toll on Hong Kong retail industry.
""Because fewer tourists come here, the medicines are now covered in dust,"" said a cosmeceutical store owner who called himself Wai.
Wai's store is located at To Kwa Wan in the eastern shore of Kowloon Peninsula, the first stop for many tour groups to Hong Kong. However, violent clashes have left the bustling neighborhood deserted.
According to Wai, since July, the number of visitors from the mainland has dropped sharply, and his business has shrunk by 70 percent.
""Now, Hong Kong is so chaotic that tourists dare not come,"" said Wai. ""I hope those protesters will stop making troubles and let others live."""
Hong Kong court denies bail to suspect involved in assaulting reporter,"HONG KONG, Aug. 19 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong court on Monday denied bail to a man involved in assaulting a reporter from the mainland during a recent unlawful assembly at the Hong Kong International Airport.
The Eastern Magistrates' Court adjourned the case, in which the male, 19, was accused of unlawful assembly, wounding and assault occasioning actual bodily harm, to Oct. 28 for further police inquiries.
The man, surnamed Lai, was suspected of assaulting Fu Guohao, a journalist from Global Times, during the violent incident that occurred in the wee hours of Aug. 14 at the Hong Kong International Airport.
The prosecutor stressed the severity of Lai's violent acts as he continued the assault even after ambulance attendants had put Fu on a stretcher. Lai had been bailed after being arrested for charging the police line during a protest on July 14 at New Town Plaza in Sha Tin District and was due on court on Friday.
The defendant is likely to commit another offence at a major public event in the future, the prosecutor said.
During a press briefing of the Hong Kong police on Monday, Kong Wing-cheung, senior superintendent of police public relations branch, said anyone who willfully commits violent acts at an international airport that endangers, or likely to, the safety of the airport or of other people faces a sentence of life imprisonment.
Kong said a total of 178 police officers had been injured since June 9."
Feature: Thousands gather in Sydney calling for end to violence in China's Hong Kong,"SYDNEY, Aug. 17 (Xinhua) -- Around 3,000 people marched peacefully through the streets of Sydney on Saturday to call for an end to the violence which has gripped China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) in recent weeks.
Mobilized through social media, the Stop Riots in Hong Kong rally was predominantly made up of Chinese students living Down Under. However, there was also a large number of local supporters in attendance as well.
Among banners that said ""Protect Hong Kong, fight against violence,"" One of the group's leader Tony Jiang, who is an Australia citizen of Chinese descent, told Xinhua ""We came here to stand against the violent riots and the decaying law and order in Hong Kong.""
Radical protesters in Hong Kong have abandoned their peaceful protests and unfortunately some of them have turned into violent mobs who smashed the parliament, ransacked the police stations and threw bricks and petrol bombs on the streets, Tony Jiang said.
""We support and we understand peaceful protest, but we believe it has grown into an out-of-control situation.""
Horrified by the current unrest in the global financial hub, a female marketing student from China who was too afraid to give her full name said she had become very concerned for her friends living in Hong Kong.
""A Chinese friend of mine works in a hotel. it's not safe for her to get home in the middle of the night now,"" Mem told Xinhua.
""At first I could understand their purpose and why they were having their protests. I even have a friend who was involved in the protests.""
""But everything just started to turn in a really bad way and I asked my friend a few days ago and she said many of the protesters began to do extreme things. It has now become chaos. It's getting really, really bad.""
With large-scale protests beginning back in June, the situation has quickly continued to escalate.
To show their solidarity with law enforcement officers in Hong Kong, many at Saturday's rally held up signs with messages of support for police.
While others raised red banners with slogans of praise for the Hong Kong SAR government and chanted ""We love China, we love Hong Kong,"" the large group also sang the Chinese national anthem and hoisted the Chinese and Australian national flags in unison.
It's so hard to see the police, with one policeman's finger bitten off by rioters, one of the group's female organisers who asked to be referred to as CC told Xinhua.
""I think those rioters should stop what they are doing and truly talk to the government, not using violence. Talking is the way. Violence is not.""
""This is not peaceful at all.""
A Chinese-Australian citizen named Ray told Xinhua ""We are all Chinese. There is only one China... Doesn't matter if you are from Hong Kong or Taiwan, we are all Chinese. We are all brothers and sisters,"" he said."
Commentary: Martin Lee's hypocrisy and obsession with stirring up chaos in Hong Kong,"BEIJING, Aug. 21 (Xinhua) -- Over the past two months, many opposition figures have been stirring up unlawful rallies, chaos and instability in Hong Kong.
Among those was Martin Lee Chu-ming, a diehard proxy for foreign anti-China forces.
A revisit of what Lee has said and done over the past decades showed his long-time antagonism to his own country.
Before Hong Kong's return to China, Lee actively supported policies by British authorities and begged for external forces' interference.
Early on in 1988 when he visited the United States, Lee said: ""I believe many will think it is the best that Hong Kong remains a British colony for another 100 years.""
He even advised the U.S. Congress in 1990 that the United States should enact a set of special policies based on the political wills of a fraction of Hong Kong people.
During another visit to the United States in 1996, Lee again begged for the U.S. side to meddle in Hong Kong affairs.
After Hong Kong's successful return to the motherland in 1997, Lee continued his provocation against the ""one country, two systems"" principle and repeatedly attacked the central government in endless China-bashing moves.
When China was preparing for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Lee, in the Wall Street Journal, asked the United States to use the Games to pressure China for so-called ""human rights.""
For a long time, Lee has been in close contact with Sinophobia figures in the United States and the United Kingdom, begging and helping Western countries to meddle in Hong Kong affairs and interfere in China's internal affairs.
Considered to be opposition's so-called ""godfather,"" Lee once said he ""dared to be the running dog for colonialism"" and took advantage of his influence as a member of the Legislative Council (LegCo) and as a barrister to mentor a number of hard-core troublemakers in Hong Kong, including Benny Tai, the mastermind of the 2014 ""Occupy Central"" incident and media tycoon Jimmy Lai Chee-ying, another ""black hand"" behind the city's latest chaos and violence.
Lee has been trying to exploit the proposed amendments to Hong Kong's ordinances on the transfer of fugitives to stir up chaos by acting as a planner, agitator and organizer of the latest demonstrations and violent protests.
To that end, he frequently sought foreign intervention on many visits to the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, while colluding with Jimmy Lai to use the media Lai controls to publish a mix of distorted propaganda.
During his 2019 visit to the United States, Lee begged for U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's support in compelling the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government to withdraw the amendments.
Martin Lee, Anson Chan Fang On-sang and other opposition figures were found to have secretly met with Julie Eadeh, a diplomat from the U.S. Consulate General in Hong Kong in August who also secretly met with ""Hong Kong independence"" activists including Joshua Wong Chi-fung and Nathan Law Kwun-chung, according to Hong Kong media reports.
Ironically, it was Lee who first raised the issue of fugitive transfers between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland in 1998 when he was a LegCo member. Then, Lee proposed arrangements for such transfers, citing ""fugitives threaten the peace and stability of Hong Kong.""
When radical protesters repeatedly paralyzed the airport, vandalized public buildings, blocked roads, obstructed metro lines, besieged police stations and assaulted police officers with hurled bricks, iron bars, corrosive liquids and even petrol bombs, Lee publicly glorified such acts as ""peaceful means"" with ""the admiration of the whole world.""
While coaxing numerous young people into violence, vandalism and crime, Lee stayed behind the scene and never let younger generations of his family got involved in ""street politics.""
The ungraceful records of Lee's misleading and deceptive deeds over the years have proven that he remains one of the sources of the current chaos in Hong Kong and a diehard proxy for foreign anti-China forces, disregarding the long-term interests of most Hong Kong people and the whole of China.
As an old Chinese saying goes, ""those who are busy with wrongdoings will end with self-destruction."" The same warning, undoubtedly, applies to Martin Lee."
"Spotlight: Recent situation ""most dangerous"" in 25 years, says senior Hong Kong police officer","HONG KONG, Aug. 19 (Xinhua) -- As violent protests entered the third month in Hong Kong, a senior British officer in the Hong Kong police force said the recent and current situation is the most dangerous that he faced in 25 years, and the protesters seem to be well-organized and willing to go to extreme to follow a certain agenda.
""The situation on the front line is the most dangerous that I faced in over 25 years because of the level of aggression and violence from rocks, missiles and spears,"" Chief Superintendent David Jordan, British, said in an interview.
Jordan, 52, serves as the Commandant of the Police Tactical Unit, a force for large-scale emergencies. Since joining the Hong Kong police in 1992, he has been involved in countless public order events, in particular working as a major police commander during the illegal ""Occupy Central"" movement in 2014.
As an operational commander in multiple clashes between radicals and the police during the past two months, the police veteran was still shocked by how quickly a peaceful procession can turn destructive, how violent some protesters can become against police officers trying to keep order, and how well-organized and planned the escalating violence can be.
""There is a routine now that initially a peaceful demonstration will very quickly change into a proactive violent destructive group of individuals who are only concerned that attacking a police station and police officers who are deployed simply to maintain order or that causing huge disruption by proactively blocking roads,"" he said.
""What is very noticeable is that there has been a willingness from the protesters to use increasingly violent means and disruptive methods to cause chaos,"" Jordan said. ""They have an intent, I believe, if they have a chance to physically maim and harm police officers.""
Jordan described the assaults carried out by black-clad, masked radicals who wore helmets and held umbrellas, some with knives in their hands.
""As soon as the police officers turn up on the ground being very reactive and passive, they will immediately come under serious verbal abuse, and increasingly they will have hard items, rocks, bricks, sharpened implements, spears, bows and arrows thrown at them,"" Jordan said. ""And this, no matter how you phrase it, is a threat to their lives.""
The weaponry of radicals also included toxic powders, corrosive liquids and petrol bombs. A police officer was hit by a petrol bomb thrown by a radical protester in Tsim Sha Tsui at the night of August 11 and suffered burns to his legs, according to the Hong Kong Police Force.
Since June 9, 177 police personnel have sustained injuries during operations, including 11 policewomen.
Wong Ka-lun, Senior Inspector of No. 4 Platoon of Emergency Unit of Kowloon East Region, was hit in the mouth by a steel ball fired from a slingshot on August 5, when handling the blockages by hundreds of demonstrators on Lung Cheung Road along with merely over 20 police officers.
He was diagnosed with swelling and laceration of his lips, with a broken tooth in the lower jaw that needed to be removed.
""I believe demonstrators are well organized and they do seem to have an agenda, and they are prepared to go to extreme levels in the following of this agenda,"" Jordan said.
With the implementation of such agenda, the situation in Hong Kong has been worsening. Police headquarters were surrounded, and government agencies disrupted. The Legislative Council building was also ransacked.
Radical protesters besieged and attacked the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and defaced the national emblem in front of the building on July 21. Masked extreme radicals recently twice ripped the Chinese national flag off the pole in Tsim Sha Tsui and flung it into the sea.
Protesters also deliberately blocked main roads, disrupted subway operation and packed the high-speed railway station, leading to paralyzed traffic. Their so-called ""sit-in"" at the Hong Kong International Airport also turned into massive blockades, causing chaos at one of the world's busiest airports. Not only flights were canceled and numerous tourists stranded, but a traveler and a reporter were detained and beaten.
The Hong Kong police have arrested 748 radical protesters during a series of violent incidents since June 9. Among the arrested, 115 have been charged with various offensives.
The dangerous situation, with sometimes 100 violent protesters surrounding one police officer, has justified the use of force which is commensurate with the level of violence, Jordan said.
""What is a shame is that it is an individual photo that may be used to show a four-hour incident,"" Jordan said. ""And unfortunately, that one photo is sending the message. And that one photo is used to say police brutality or excess use of force without having any idea of the circumstances that led to that use of force.""
""We have been incredibly restrained, and also we are only reactive,"" Jordan said. ""I strongly feel that the role and the actions of the Hong Kong police have been as tolerant as any other police force on the planet would have been. A lot of other police forces would have acted far more productively and possibly aggressively against this kind of situation.""
Fulfilling the duty of maintaining peace and stability in Hong Kong has led to many police officers themselves, including Jordan, and their families harassed and threatened.
""This is very new that they are specifically targeting the children and spouses of serving police officers,"" he said. ""Children of police officers are being singled out, for bullying or for comments."" 
Police officers at four o'clock in the morning got pizza delivered that they haven't ordered, which means some people know where that person lives, Jordan said.
Despite all the danger and difficulties, Jordan said he has never regretted joining the police. ""I strongly believe that the Hong Kong police force is still one of the most professional in the world.""
""I'm just one of the Hong Kong police officers attempting to maintain order and serve the other 99 percent of Hong Kong people that do not support this violence and disruption, want to go about their daily lifestyle, and live without the fear of crime, disruption and violence, and that's what we're trying to achieve,"" he said."
"Roundup: Violent protests arouse international concern over prosperity, stability in Hong Kong","BEIJING, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- Violence perpetrated by radical protesters in Hong Kong has aroused international concern that the prosperity and stability of the city are in jeopardy.
Citing a recent incident where two Chinese mainland citizens were assaulted and detained by some radical demonstrators, British Sky News said in an article that those demonstrators ""identified someone they thought was suspicious and mob mentality took over.""
In another report, the New York Times noted that ""uglier scenes developed ..., as a few scuffles broke out between protesters and travelers, who for the first time were being blocked from the departure gates.""
""The violence of the demonstrations has escalated beyond what would be allowed or accepted in any Western city,"" said Glenda Korporaal, a China correspondent for The Australian, in an opinion on Wednesday.
Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun also reported on Wednesday that Hong Kong International Airport, Asia's major air hub, was paralyzed by protests over the last two days, upsetting life of ordinary Hong Kong citizens.
A woman who was planning to travel to Malaysia with her family said outrageously that the protests were aimed at destroying Hong Kong's economy, the paper said.
The protests have cast a shadow over Hong Kong's economy, the Japanese paper commented, adding that some investment institutes have already lowered the forecast for the city's economic growth in 2019.
Meanwhile, Japan's national broadcasting organization NHK reported that Japanese companies in Hong Kong have also been affected by the protests, adding that some Japanese chain stores in Hong Kong have seen their sales declining recently due to the violence.
Another Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun reported on Thursday that as protests and violence in Hong Kong intensify, business of some Japanese companies in Hong Kong has suffered a blow. Some employees' commute has also been affected.
One of the employees said he hoped the situation could calm down as soon as possible, said the report."
Xinhua Headlines: How external forces have inflamed tensions in Hong Kong,"HONG KONG, Aug. 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Mike Pence's remarks on Monday, the latest by Western politicians on Hong Kong, has drawn strong opposition from the Chinese side.
The Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Tuesday expressed strong dissatisfaction and objection.
It said some U.S. politicians have clung to the Cold War mentality, hegemonic thinking and the zero-sum bias, confounded right with wrong, and grossly interfered in China's internal affairs by making irresponsible comments. ""We strongly deplore and firmly oppose it,"" the office said.
Starting June 9, demonstrators protested the proposed amendments by the HKSAR government to two ordinances concerning fugitive offenders. Even though the amendments have been completely halted, the opposition made more demands and raised the level of violence.
In the following weeks, tensions escalated as radical protesters used guerrilla tactics to stage strikes, block public transport, damage public facilities, besiege police stations and attack police officers, pushing the city to the brink of chaos.
Over the last two months, some Western governments and figures have issued statements regarding Hong Kong and taken actions related to the protests and violence.
Some politicians hosted Hong Kong opposition leaders and rendered them support on different occasions. Some frequently spoke up to manipulate and radicalize public opinions in Hong Kong. Some advocated violence and clashes in the name of democracy and freedom with a true aim to create disorder and chaos.
On March 21, the U.S. State Department published the 2019 Hong Kong Policy Act Report, in which it made a series of false accusations regarding Hong Kong, saying its autonomy is diminished. The HKSAR government rejected the report as distorting facts and causing confusion.
Days later, U.S. politicians, led by Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, held meetings with Hong Kong opposition and backed demonstrations. Hong Kong's former chief secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang was among the group who traveled to the United States.
On July 8, both Pence and Pompeo met with Hong Kong opposition businessman Jimmy Lai to discuss developments related to the amendments and the status of Hong Kong. The visit was seen as ""very unusual for a [non-government] visitor to get that kind of access"", according to media reports.
Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, repeatedly voiced her support of violence in Hong Kong. In June, she called the demonstrations in Hong Kong ""a beautiful sight to behold"", when radical protesters were assaulting police officers with bricks, home-made spears, and petrol bombs.
In August, Pelosi made statements to support the protesters, in which she called rioters ""courageous"" and claimed that Hong Kong police use ""aggression and abuse"".
Frontline Hong Kong police officers said they have been under immense pressure.
Chief Superintendent David Jordan, who is British, said the situation on the front line was the most dangerous that he has faced in over 25 years, due to the level of aggression.
""We have been incredibly restrained, and also we are only reactive. I strongly feel that the role and the actions of the Hong Kong police have been as tolerant as any other police force on the planet would have been,"" he said.
On Aug. 13, Pelosi called for the passing of a so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act to further meddle in Hong Kong affairs.
As she posted the statement, radical protesters plunged the Hong Kong International Airport into chaos on Aug. 13 and 14. Protesters harassed passengers and inflicted severe physical harm to two mainland residents. These extreme behaviors have been widely condemned by the public.
As another piece of evidence of meddling, Julie Eadeh, a diplomat in the U.S. Consulate General in Hong Kong, met with ""Hong Kong independence"" activists including Joshua Wong Chi-fung and Nathan Law Kwun-chung on Aug. 8.
After their meeting, these activists said they discussed using a U.S. bill to sanction Hong Kong and urging the United States to stop selling equipment to the Hong Kong police.
During the protests, radical protesters waved British and U.S. flags when they vandalized road infrastructure and attacked police on duty.
On Aug. 13, the European External Action Service issued a statement on the situation in Hong Kong. On Aug. 17, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland issued a joint statement on Hong Kong.
Both statements, misleading and incorrect, have been refuted by the Chinese side.
These meetings and words are ""irresponsible remarks"" and ""wrong signals"" to fan protests and pressure the government, observers in Hong Kong said.
""Whenever the Hong Kong opposition seemed weak, officials and advocates in the United States jumped out to comment and called on them to continue,"" said Chan Yung, an HKSAR deputy to the National People's Congress and vice-chairperson of Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong.
""The intervention of external forces has only complicated matters and made the situation precarious. The United States wants to use Hong Kong issues as a bargaining chip with China. That plan is not going to work,"" he said.
Observers said what has happened in Hong Kong bears the feature of a color revolution that is aimed at overthrowing the government.
""It is an organized and coordinated version of a color revolution that is aimed to snatch the governance authority of Hong Kong through resorting to violence,"" said Yiu Chi-Shing, chairman of Hong Kong Association for Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China.
""Look at the regions hurt by color revolutions, they left nothing but chaos. We should prevent Hong Kong from falling into the trap,"" he said.
Begging for foreign influence and intervention is a dangerous move that challenges the red line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle, observers and authorities said.
""I advise those politicians who speak beautiful words but spread seeds of social hatred and discord to be responsible and clear-headed. Their tricks will never succeed,"" said Yang Guang, spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council."
Commentary: Jimmy Lai's despicable legacy of fomenting chaos in Hong Kong,"BEIJING, Aug. 20 (Xinhua) -- The majority of people in Hong Kong have had enough of prolonged radical protests and violence since June. They are especially fed up with media tycoon Jimmy Lai Chee-ying who has continuously fanned up social disorder and even violence.
Lai, founder of Next Digital and the tabloid Apple Daily newspaper, has played an important role in fomenting the current chaos and instability in Hong Kong.
By inviting external forces to meddle in Hong Kong affairs, Lai shows how eager he has sought to serve as a political tool for foreign powers to oppose China and cause chaos in Hong Kong.
Over the years, Lai has tried to destabilize Hong Kong and willfully pushed his own political agenda. His actions challenged the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle and threatened China's national sovereignty.
Lai bought his status as a proxy in Hong Kong by donating to U.S. political parties. It is through him that foreign anti-China forces channel funding to opposition leaders and a small fraction of so-called ""Hong Kong independence"" forces.
Meanwhile, Lai frequently met with politicians in the United States. In July, he was received by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to discuss developments related to amendments to the fugitive offenders ordinances and the status of Hong Kong.
Lai was believed to be the ""black hand"" behind Hong Kong's ""Occupy Central"" incident in 2014. A year before the incident, he went to Taiwan to learn street protest tactics. Lai also used the media he controlled to spread disinformation to the public, create and spread rumors, and fan the fire of hatred and fears against Chinese mainland.
Lai assumed an active role in the current round of protests and violence. The Apple Daily newspaper that he owns printed ads directly calling on people to take to the street, and created an echo chamber to defame the lawful efforts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government to fix loopholes in the legal system. His smear campaign misled many people in Hong Kong.
Even though the HKSAR government has announced on many occasions that the amendments have been halted, Lai demanded more. Glorifying rioters and vandalism, and vilifying the police, Lai declared: ""As I watched the protesters kicking the police, I felt an utmost sense of release.""
As Hong Kong reeled from radical protests and violence, an increasing number of people -- retailers, tour guides, restauranteurs, taxi and truck drivers -- earned less and suffered from the economic hardship, while Lai profited handsomely from the instability.
After radical protests gripped Hong Kong since June, the market value of Lai's media company rocketed. The market value of Next Digital, of which Lai is the majority stakeholder, surged more than 80 percent in a week after Hong Kong sank into chaos.
Despite his notoriety of spreading disinformation, Lai branded himself as a spokesperson of the Hong Kong people only to hijack the future of the Hong Kong people.
Lai claimed that the West has the obligation to lend support to ""change not only the future of Hong Kong but even that of the whole of China,"" a blatant confession of whom he is loyal to.
History has proved time and again, anyone who betrays his country for personal gains will always be nailed to the pillar of shame in history."
Commentary: Protesters in Hong Kong shock world with ugly tactics,"by Nathan Morley
NICOSIA, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- Over the last week, Hong Kong has been disrupted from top to bottom by black-clad radicals hell-bent on causing chaos and wrecking the economy.
Everywhere, public life has been severely disturbed.
In such a climate, it comes as little surprise that the public are increasingly looking for a return to order and normality on this once-tranquil territory of China.
The international community is also looking on with increasing dismay at frenzied mob violence which has seen the radicals hurl rocks, use petrol bombs, fire slingshots, and let off air guns.
Even Bonnie Leung, a key protest organizer, was forced onto the back foot and publicly acknowledged on British radio that there are ""radical protestors"" amongst her ranks.
Her admission came after BBC host Razia Iqbal asserted: ""It is factually accurate, isn't it, that the protestors are becoming increasingly more violent?""
Protests at the airport earlier this week not only left the aviation industry reeling, but terrified holidaymakers, businessmen, families and others who were needlessly dragged into the fray.
In one especially ugly encounter, protesters screamed at a passenger carrying a child. Other passengers were verbally abused by the protesters, while a reporter from the Chinese mainland was left badly shaken after being zip-tied to a luggage trolley and physically assaulted.
Even Britain's The Guardian newspaper observed that it was ""not the first time that protesters have used violent tactics."" The paper reported ""they have been seen on a number of occasions hurling bricks and other items at riot police, while a police officer over the weekend was injured by a petrol bomb.""
Over the last few days, the government calls for calm in Hong Kong have contrasted sharply with the dismissive arrogance of those tearing up the streets, who, it seems, have neither the courage nor the integrity nor the respect for their fellow citizens to comprehend the damage they are creating.
If tensions escalate further, the prospect of a greater economic backlash seems inevitable. And that, many observers say, would suit protesters as they continue to drag Hong Kong deeper into a crisis.
Mob violence leads to more mob violence.
The 7 million citizens of Hong Kong -- with their frayed nerves and growing anxiety -- continue to remain hostage to a small clique of increasingly violent radicals.
Easing their suffering with a return to normality must now be the absolute priority."
"Feature: Over 470,000 people in Hong Kong say ""no"" to violence","HONG KONG, Aug. 17 (Xinhua) -- ""Anti-violence!"", ""Save Hong Kong!"" Over 470,000 people gathered on Saturday in a rally held at Tamar Park, Admiralty of Hong Kong, to voice out their demand for peace and stability in Hong Kong.
At around 4 p.m. local time, the metro station near Tamar Park was swarming with people. An hour later, the rally started as the Chinese national anthem was ringing out.
Waving the Chinese national flag and the flag of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and holding signs written with slogans including ""Stop Riots"", ""Anti-violence"" and ""Save Hong Kong"", the crowd was enthusiastic and impassioned despite the rain. They chanted the slogans to express their views.
At the beginning of the rally, a video was played, featuring a recording of a policeman's wife who spoke, choking back sobs, of how violent protesters stormed the police stations and attacked the police. She appealed to the public to support the police and Hong Kong during this difficult time. ""Police, keep it up!"", ""Save Hong Kong!"" the crowd cried out at the end of the video.
Tam Yiu-chung, a member of the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress, called upon people from all walks of life to firmly oppose violence.
The national flag and emblem represent the dignity of the country, and those who insult the national flag and emblem are turning themselves into enemies of the people in the whole country, Tam added.
Rebuking the recent illegal assemblies and violent acts at Hong Kong International Airport as ""the ugliest riot in the world"", Maria Tam Wai-chu deputy director of the National People's Congress Standing Committee Basic Law Committee from Hong Kong, stressed that everyone should respect the freedoms of others and the exercise of freedom does not include wanton destruction of public properties or obstruction of public transport.
Wong Kam-leung, chairman of Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers, said that the violence in Hong Kong has been escalating over the past two months and he was distressed to see young people using force and violating laws.
He called on the young people to ""stop and think twice"" before engaging in violent or illegal acts.
A 57-year-old gardener surnamed Chan said sometimes she could not go to work because radical demonstrators disrupted the traffic, ""which was very annoying.""
""Hong Kong has always been a peaceful society. I hope the extremist radicals stop violent acts so that people can return to peaceful life,"" she said.
A finance professional surnamed Lee said his business has been badly hit by the illegal demonstrations since many of his clients are too concerned to invest in Hong Kong.
""The common aspiration of the overwhelming majority of people in Hong Kong is that the violence and chaos will stop soon. Our community has been torn apart and can not afford any more of it,"" he said. ""We urge the demonstrators and mobs to stop it immediately; otherwise, the whole community has to pay for the consequences.""
A local resident, Wendy, a mother of a young boy, told the reporter that her life was largely affected by the violent protests going on in the recent two months.
""For the sake of our future generations and Hong Kong getting back on track, we refuse to be in silence, we must let the world hear our voice,"" she said firmly.
The assembly ended at around 6 p.m. local time, with the participants singing the chorus Below the Lion Rock, a famous song in Hong Kong that represents the spirit of unity and hard-working."
1st LD Writethru: Hong Kong airport resumes operation after protest-forced halt,"HONG KONG, Aug. 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong International Airport started to resume operation on Wednesday after chaos and flight cancellations caused by protesters.
Passengers are now able to conduct check-in procedures after tickets or purchase vouchers are checked by airport staff. A demonstration area has been marked out at the arrival hall.
Airport Authority Hong Kong said earlier Wednesday that it has obtained an interim injunction to restrain persons from unlawfully and willfully obstructing or interfering with the proper use of the airport.
The authority emphasized that persons are also restrained from attending or participating in any demonstration or protest or public order event in the airport other than in the area designated by the airport authority.
The interim injunction expressly provides that nothing in the interim injunction shall be construed as authorizing any demonstration, protest or public order event contrary to the Public Order Ordinance.
Many of the passengers, who have their flights delayed or changed, are still waiting at the airport for confirmation of their departure time.
""It was totally chaos last night and those people in black were everywhere. We were very scared,"" said Maria, a passenger from the Philippines. ""I just hope we can fly on time today.""
""I'm very angry. Some of the protesters said they were sorry but I think they were just having fun here, obstructing us,"" said Pia from Germany. ""I can't believe this could be happening in the 21st century.""
""I only wish I can leave Hong Kong safely and go back home,"" she said.
As one of the busiest in the world, the Hong Kong International Airport handled an average of 200,000 travelers each day in 2018.
Frank Chan, secretary for transport and housing of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government, said paralyzing the airport will make Hong Kong ""pay a heavy price.""
""Amid fierce regional competition, it is very easy to destroy years of achievements the airport has accomplished, but rebuilding them will be very hard,"" Chan said."
Feature: Woman's courage inspires Hong Kong society against violence,"by Xinhua writers Lu Jiafei, Zhu Yuxuan
Hong Kong, Aug. 21 (Xinhua) -- Nestling in the labyrinthine seafood market of the quiet Lei Yue Mun fishing village in Hong Kong, a snug little tea restaurant has unexpectedly become a beacon of courage for ordinary Hong Kong people seeking peace amid the recent chaos.
After she posted pictures backing up Hong Kong police against some radical protesters at the end of June, Kate Lee, the owner of the tea restaurant, found her conscience took a heavy toll on her family business.
Confronted with threats and insults from anti-police radicals, Lee refused to knuckle under, and her bravery has inspired more Hong Kong people to speak out against violence.
TRANQUILITY OF LIFE BROKEN
Had Lee chosen to steer clear of the tumult roiling Hong Kong for weeks, the tranquility of her life would have continued.
Since June, Hong Kong has been roiled by violent protests. Though the police exercised restraint, some well-organized radical protesters continually assaulted their line of defense with bricks, home-made spears, vision-harming lasers and even petrol bombs.
Concerned about the stability of Hong Kong, Lee went to a rally against violence in late June and voiced her support to the police on social media.
Then, scare phone calls started and Lee became a target of online bullying.
To the insult of Lee, who always prides herself on the quality of food in her tea restaurant, a lot of negative comments suddenly emerged on major online food platforms against her business.
To punish Lee, protesters angered by her public support to police even made malicious complaints to the Labor Department about alleged illegal employment in the restaurant.
At the age of 51, the single mother takes care of her family business all on her own.
""I don't understand why supporting Hong Kong police, who laboriously maintain law and order, could become a sin to some people here,"" she told Xinhua.
SUPPORTS POURING IN
Whoever thought that intimidation and insults could silence her, their hopes were soon dashed by Lee's determination to crusade against violence.
Despite admonition from her friends to keep a low profile, Lee ascended the stage of a large-scale anti-violence rally early August, sharing her story and calling for more Hong Kong residents to speak out their support to the police.
This time, her bravery and conscience resonated with the Hong Kong society, and support for her kept pouring in.
On a scorching Tuesday afternoon in mid-August, a 75-year-old Hong Kong resident surnamed Yu travelled almost 50 km from Tin Shui Wai, in northwestern Hong Kong, to Lee's tea restaurant.
It took him over two hours to get there.
Residing far away from the bustling metropolis, Yu said he could not attend any previous rallies supporting the police due to his age and the grueling travel.
""But I have to come here and show my support to Lee,"" he said. ""It broke my heart to see an honorable woman being insulted and bullied just because she spoke out the truth against violence.""
For years, Lee has routinely taken one day off on Tuesday. When she came back to check the tea restaurant that day, she was greeted by strangers travelling across Hong Kong to show their support.
""I want to hug her for her bravery, thank her for speaking out for us and support her in this heartbreaking campaign against violence,"" a woman surnamed Yeung told Xinhua.
MORE INSPIRED TO SPEAK OUT
Standing tentatively outside Lee's tea restaurant, a Hong Kong resident surnamed Chan, who lived in the neighboring area of Lam Tin, smiled bashfully and said he would better stay outside for a while.
""I'm here to support Lee, but I need to calm down first,"" Chan said.
Like Lee, Chan was also a victim swept into the sinister vortex of anti-police sentiment in Hong Kong.
""I used to remain neutral in what happened between protesters and the police,"" he said. ""However, after I questioned on social media apparently misleading reports by some Hong Kong media, I was targeted brutally by those in favor of violence.""
Chan said he believed there were still lots of people in Hong Kong who chose to stay silent on the issue.
""I understand those people's concerns, but we are standing at a crossroads where the future of Hong Kong is in jeopardy,"" he said. ""We cannot stay silent anymore.""
For a Hong Kong resident surnamed Chow, staying in silence was never an option.
""The chaos now in the Hong Kong society is abnormal, and Lee's public support to the police is just and reflects her conscience,"" said Chow.
Though Hong Kong police had exercised restraint and tolerance in the face of protestors and only used appropriate tactics in accordance with the law when necessary, reports by some Hong Kong media portrayed them as brutal and excessive in using force.
""Those Hong Kong media are far from their claim of objective reporting,"" said Chow. ""For decades, the Hong Kong police have been globally renowned for their professional dedication to keeping Hong Kong safe and stable. How can they suddenly turn evil?"""
Hong Kong protests turn violent again,"HONG KONG, Aug. 25 (Xinhua) -- Protests turned violent in Tsuen Wan, in the western New Territories of Hong Kong, on Sunday as radical protesters hurled bricks and petrol bombs at police officers.
Sunday's marches took place in Tsuen Wan and neighboring areas. After the marches ended, violent protesters deviated from their routes to attack police officers.
Some radical protesters hurled bricks and petrol bombs at police officers outside Yeung Uk Road Market in Tsuen Wan. They also aimed strong light beams at police officers and setting up barricades to confront the police.
Protesters escalated their violence in the afternoon and evening. They blocked various roads in Tsuen Wan, paralyzing traffic in the vicinity.
Having given repeated warnings to the protesters in vain, anti-riot officers fired tear gas and used minimum force to disperse them."
Hong Kong police arrest another suspect involved in assaulting reporter,"HONG KONG, Aug. 20 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong police said on Tuesday that another suspect was arrested Monday for assaulting a reporter from the mainland during a recent unlawful assembly at the Hong Kong International Airport.
The female, 23, was charged with unlawful detention and unlawful assembly and wounding, Kong Wing-cheung, senior superintendent of police public relations branch, told a press briefing.
As far, two suspects have been arrested for assaulting Fu Guohao, a journalist from the Beijing-based Global Times newspaper, during the violent incident at the airport a week ago.
The case, along with a 49-year-old male suspected of attacking a police officer, were brought to court on Tuesday.
A total of 179 police officers have been injured since June 9. In the latest case, a female police officer was sent to hospital after being aimed at the eye by a laser pointer of demonstrators while on duty around the government headquarters on June 18.
""We do not accept or tolerate any violence, and we will investigate into all cases impartially,"" said Tse Chun-chung, chief superintendent of police public relations branch. ""It is our duty and commitment to fairly and strictly bring all offenders to justice.""
Tse also said demonstrations have disturbed daily lives of local residents as the police have received more than 9,000 letters of complaint during the past two months.
As such large-scale public activities have affected public order, the police will be more cautious in approving such events to avoid the impacts on local residents, he said.
Tse called on protesters to respect other residents and not to go to the airport or form human chains on the street as such activities will seriously disrupt traffic and order."
Hong Kong railway operator obtains interim injunction amid disruptive acts,"HONG KONG, Aug. 23 (Xinhua) -- The MTR Corporation, Hong Kong's railway operator, has obtained an interim injunction from the court on Friday evening as violent acts of some radicals disrupted order in several stations recently.
Effective until Aug. 30, the interim injunction will restrain persons from unlawfully and willfully obstructing or interfering with the proper use of the stations, trains of the railway network, and the High Speed Rail West Kowloon Station, according to an MTR statement.
It will also restrain persons from damaging any property or trains, using any threatening, abusive, obscene or offensive language or willfully interfering with the comfort or convenience of any MTR staff at any station.
MTR said the move was due to recent repeated instances where stations facilities were vandalized, staff were harassed and the safety of staff and passengers was threatened.
Responding to upcoming protest activities, MTR said it will stop train service to and from the concerned stations or even close stations with little or no prior notice if fights, vandalism or other acts of violence occur, or under high risks or emergency situations.
The police may need to enter stations to take suitable law enforcement action when necessary, MTR said."

Interview: Hong Kong needs to restore public order as soon as possible: Philippine expert,"MANILA, Aug. 25 (Xinhua) -- The continued chaos, abetted by the external forces, have disrupted the city's daily life and the Hong Kong government needs to act decisively to restore public order as soon as possible, a Philippine political expert said.
Henry Chan, a visiting researcher of the Philippine-based thinktank Integrated Development Studies Institute, told Xinhua during a recent interview that the escalating violent protests in Hong Kong since June have seriously sabotaged its social order.
""I have noticed that the radicals moved around the city to barricade and vandalize police stations. They paralyzed these neighborhoods by blocking off principal streets,"" Chan said.
The violent protesters also occupied the Hong Kong International Airport and stranded thousands of innocent commuters, which hurts Hong Kong's reputation as a key transport hub in East Asia, he added.
He also said the external forces played a role in the continued chaos in Hong Kong.
""It's impossible that a large scale protest can last more than two months without organizers behind it,"" the Philippine expert said. ""Except for some local organizers, we can find many clues and evidence that show external forces have played a role in the violent protests in Hong Kong.""
""In fact, what they want is to undermine the 'one country, two systems' in Hong Kong,"" he added.
Chan said now the Hong Kong government needs to act decisively to restore public order and Hong Kong's way of life as soon as possible.
""If the chaos continues in Hong Kong, it will further hurt Hong Kong's economy and Hong Kong's importance as a financial center will diminish,"" he said."
"Spotlight: Hong Kong officials urge dialogue to restore order, revive economy","HONG KONG, Aug. 25 (Xinhua) -- Continued internal strife has worsened Hong Kong's economy, officials and lawmakers warned Sunday, calling for restoring social order and strengthening dialogue among all walks of life to show a united front on developing Hong Kong.
The deteriorating external environment and the continued violent protests in Hong Kong are creating an ""economic typhoon"", Paul Chan Mo-po, financial secretary of the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), wrote in an article online.
According to Chan, the aggregate unemployment rate of the retail, accommodation and food services sectors, which create 600,000 jobs, has risen from 3.4 percent at the start of the year to 4.3 percent, with 27,500 unemployed.
According to data from the Census and Statistics Department, the number of unemployed persons increased by around 4,200 from 114, 300 in April-June to 118, 500 in May-July.
""In retrospect, the unemployment situation deteriorates much faster than people would expect,"" said Chan, citing Hong Kong's experience of weathering several economic crises over the past two decades, including the bursting of the dotcom bubble, where unemployment rate rose from 4.4 percent at the end of 2000 to 7.5 percent in mid-2002, and then to 8.5 percent in 2003.
The negative impact of the protracted strife on Hong Kong's economy has begun to emerge, Chan said, adding that it depends on the Hong Kong people's decision whether the impact would be deeper and broader and affect more people's livelihood or not.
""We hope that everyone can let the Hong Kong society calm down first. Let consultation replace conflicts and let dialogue replace fists, so as to safeguard Hong Kong as our common home and avoid more residents' jobs and livelihood being affected,"" said Chan.
In another article posted online, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury James Henry Lau Jr. said that Hong Kong's economic growth is becoming increasingly sluggish due to external factors, including the U.S.-China trade frictions and a possible ""hard Brexit"" of Britain from the European Union, as well as social strife within the Hong Kong society.
While the macro environment affecting Hong Kong's economy cannot be changed, Lau said that he hopes the Hong Kong society can resolve its internal strife as soon as possible.
Otherwise, international investors may lose confidence in Hong Kong, which will cause long-term harm to Hong Kong, he warned.
Lau urged all parties in the Hong Kong society to put aside their prejudices and antagonism, return to reason, and safeguard Hong Kong's hard-earned achievements.
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam on Saturday called for dialogue after meeting a group of people who seek to solve the current situation on how to build a platform for dialogue.
""To solve Hong Kong's current problems, there is no other way than to communicate, listen and act,"" Lau said.
In an interview with local media, Hong Kong Legislative Council member Yiu Si-wing said that due to the protracted protests, a number of indicators of the tourism industry dropped drastically in August, with the largest decline in inbound passenger arrivals.
The impact is most pronounced on tour guides who depend on leading tour groups for a living, said the lawmaker who represents tourism.
Yiu warned that if the protests drag on, the impact would be far-reaching for the service industry."
Xinhua Headlines: Five things to know about Hong Kong's ordinance amendment issue,"HONG KONG, Aug. 23 (Xinhua) -- A series of violent activities have plagued Hong Kong since June. The following are five things you need to know about what has happened in Hong Kong.
1. HOW DID ALL THESE START?
During their trip to Taipei in February 2018, a then 19-year-old suspect surnamed Chan from Hong Kong allegedly murdered his 20-year-old pregnant girlfriend, also a Hong Kong resident, in Taipei, fled Taiwan and returned to Hong Kong alone.
The case was complicated for authorities in Hong Kong and Taiwan to handle with the transfer of the fugitive suspect, as Hong Kong has no jurisdiction over the case with the absence of a transfer agreement between Hong Kong and Taiwan.
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has agreements with 20 jurisdictions on the surrender of fugitive offenders and 32 jurisdictions over mutual legal assistance in criminal matters around the world.
To fix the legal loophole, the HKSAR government tabled the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 at the Legislative Council (LegCo) for discussion on April 3.
The bill was proposed to enable Hong Kong to conduct case-based cooperation with jurisdictions that have no effective long-term arrangement with Hong Kong on juridical assistance in criminal matters.
The HKSAR government reiterated that the amendments are meant to protect the law-abiding general public in Hong Kong and business activities from the threat of crime.
The targets of case-based surrenders are fugitives who have committed grave criminal offenses based on prima facie evidence and are wanted for justice due to the offenses committed, and the HKSAR has full discretion as to whether a case-based surrender request should be acceded to, according to the HKSAR government.
The lack of knowledge of the legal system of the Chinese mainland and the fact that some people stoked fears led to growing public concern over the bill.
A mass protest against the bill broke out on June 9.
Despite the government's promise to continue addressing concerns over the bill and repeated calls for rational discussions both at the LegCo and in the community, the LegCo meeting slated on June 12 had to be delayed after protesters violently stormed and vandalized the LegCo building.
2. HOW DID HKSAR GOVERNMENT RESPOND?
While proposing the ordinance amendments, the HKSAR government said it has dealt with the matter with caution, paid close attention to the concerns of the society, and taken concrete steps to ease their concerns.
Additional human rights protections to the bill were also introduced.
On June 15, HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced that the HKSAR government would suspend the legislative amendments until further communication and explanation work is completed.
After the amendments were completely halted, Hong Kong's opposition and some radical forces continued to use the situation to incite anger through a series of more violent protests that sent Hong Kong into chaos.
They vandalized public facilities, besieged police stations, obstructed metro lines, attacked police officers, beat up people, and caused tremendous turmoil at the Hong Kong International Airport, affecting the normal lives of ordinary Hong Kong people and hundreds of thousands of passengers.
Some opposition figures and radical protesters went even further to drum up ""Hong Kong independence"" and shouted slogans like ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times.""
As the situation worsened, the HKSAR government condemned the violent acts, called for law and order, and warned that extreme violence is pushing Hong Kong to a ""very dangerous situation.""
On Aug. 13, Lam said the most urgent task for Hong Kong at the moment is to stop violence and safeguard the rule of law, to prevent Hong Kong from sinking into ""an abyss and being smashed to pieces.""
""Only when all calm down, will genuine dialogue, fixing the rift and restoring social harmony, begin,"" Lam said.
On Aug. 20, Lam said the HKSAR government would start work immediately on building a platform for dialogue among all walks of life.
She hoped that all sides could show understanding and respect toward each other, and conduct dialogues openly and directly with people of all classes with different political stances and backgrounds, in a bid to find a way out for Hong Kong.
3. HOW DID HONG KONG POLICE REACT?
As protests often evolved into violence and assaults against police officers, Hong Kong police, facing tremendous pressure, had to fire tear gas and used batons to keep law and order on some occasions.
""We are responsive. If there are no violent charging at our check lines, no one attacking us, attacking our police station, we are not going to use force to stop it,"" Yeung Man-pun, a police officer of Kowloon City District, said on Aug. 16.
Over the past two months, radical and violent protesters repeatedly charged against police lines after marches and rallies. They wantonly blocked roads, vandalized public facilities, set fires on streets and in front of police stations, attacked police officers with iron bars, corrosive fluids, hurled bricks and petrol bombs.
Since early June, about 180 police officers have been injured and police stations were attacked over 75 times.
Still, police exercised great restraint when handling unlawful protests and only dispersed violent protesters with minimum use of force.
Chief Superintendent David Jordan said in an interview that the situation on the front line is the most dangerous that he has faced in over 25 years because of the level of aggression and violence.
Jordan, 52, serves as the Commandant of the Police Tactical Unit, a force for large-scale emergencies.
""We have been incredibly restrained, and also we are only reactive,"" Jordan said. ""I strongly feel that the role and the actions of the Hong Kong police have been as tolerant as any other police force on the planet would have been. A lot of other police forces would have acted far more productively and possibly aggressively against this kind of situation.""
Jordan said the police allow some disruption before they deploy, which is an incredible amount of tolerance for an international city police force.
The HKSAR government has firmly supported the police, saying the frontline force is under enormous pressure and facing unjust accusations of brutality.
4. HOW DOES CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SEE IT?
The central government authorities have demanded order be restored and violence be stopped.
The criminal activities blatantly challenged the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle and they must be punished by law, said Zhang Xiaoming, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, in early August.
Like many Hong Kong people have said, the ordinance amendment issue has changed in its essence and bears the features of a ""color revolution.""
The central authorities firmly support Chief Executive Carrie Lam in leading the HKSAR government's law-based governance, and they have confidence in Lam's wisdom and ability to handle the current situation in Hong Kong and lead the HKSAR government's administrative team to move forward and make further progress, Zhang said.
China's State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Wednesday said no responsible government or rule-of-law society would tolerate these acts, emphasizing that Hong Kong affairs are China's internal affairs and brook no interference by external forces.
5. WHAT CONSEQUENCES HAVE BEEN INCURRED?
Weeks of upheaval has undermined the social order and an already weak economy, with Hong Kong's retail, restaurants and tourism already hit hard.
The disorder has frayed Hong Kong residents' nerves and made lives difficult. Many small and medium-sized enterprises said they have suffered a 30-percent drop in earnings and pay cuts for employees in recent months, according to a survey.
The number of travelers to Hong Kong also dropped markedly. Nearly 30 countries or regions have issued travel warnings to Hong Kong.
The HKSAR government revised downward the real economic growth forecast for 2019 as a whole to 0 to 1 percent, from an earlier estimate of 2 to 3 percent.
The risk of an economic downturn in Hong Kong is significantly rising in the face of internal and external difficulties, said Paul Chan, HKSAR government financial secretary.
Investor confidence has been dampened, and companies have postponed plans of initial public offerings in Hong Kong.
On Aug. 15, the HKSAR government rolled out a package of measures to support enterprises and relieve people's financial burden, which will cost about 19.1 billion HK dollars (about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars).
""The Hong Kong economy is facing the risk of a downturn. We can see this from the data in the first half,"" said Lam, adding that the data in the first half has not fully reflected the severity of the problem."
Interview: Cambodia wishes to see China's Hong Kong return to normal: gov't chief spokesman,"by Mao Pengfei
PHNOM PENH, Aug. 24 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian government chief spokesman Phay Siphan said that his country wishes to see the ongoing situation in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) return to normal, noting that the kingdom supports China in ending violence in HKSAR.
Speaking in an exclusive interview with Xinhua on Friday, Siphan said Cambodia supports the one-China policy and regards the Hong Kong issue as China's internal affairs.
""We wish to see the normalcy return to Hong Kong so that the people will continue to enjoy their ways of life, and the Hong Kong's economy will continue to enjoy stronger growth,"" he said.
The chief spokesman said violent protesters in Hong Kong should stop their outlawed actions, saying that they should respect the decision of the majority of the Hong Kong people who want peace, stability and further development.
""Well, the rule of law and public order must be maintained for the interest of the public,"" he said, referring to the necessary measures the Hong Kong police have taken to respond to violent protests.
Siphan said the protesters should try to find solutions to the problems through legal ways, not through illegal protests, stressing that violent protests have adversely affected people's daily lives, economy and tourism.
""Action on the streets is not the choice.""
Talking about the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Siphan said the principle has worked well in Hong Kong and under the principle, the Hong Kong people have lived in peace, stability, and prosperity.
The chief spokesman said he had visited Hong Kong twice and witnessed its remarkable development over the past 22 years since its return to the motherland.
Siphan slammed certain western countries, saying they should not interfere in China's internal affairs under the pretext of democracy and human rights.
The chief spokesman said certain western countries are afraid of China's development, and they always attempt to do something to disrupt China's peaceful development."

The targets of case-based surrenders are fugitives who have committed grave criminal offenses based on prima facie evidence and are wanted for justice due to the offenses committed, and the HKSAR has full discretion as to whether a case-based surrender request should be acceded to, according to the HKSAR government.
The lack of knowledge of the legal system of the Chinese mainland and the fact that some people stoked fears led to growing public concern over the bill.
A mass protest against the bill broke out on June 9.
Despite the government's promise to continue addressing concerns over the bill and repeated calls for rational discussions both at the LegCo and in the community, the LegCo meeting slated on June 12 had to be delayed after protesters repeatedly attempted to storm the LegCo building.
2. HOW DID HKSAR GOVERNMENT RESPOND?
While proposing the ordinance amendments, the HKSAR government said it has dealt with the matter with caution, paid close attention to the concerns of the society, and taken concrete steps to ease their concerns.
Additional human rights protections to the bill were also introduced.
On June 15, HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced that the HKSAR government would suspend the legislative amendments until further communication and explanation work is completed.
After the amendments were completely halted, Hong Kong's opposition and some radical forces continued to use the situation to incite anger through a series of more violent protests that sent Hong Kong into chaos.
They vandalized public facilities, besieged police stations, obstructed metro lines, attacked police officers, beat up people, and caused tremendous turmoil at the Hong Kong International Airport, affecting the normal lives of ordinary Hong Kong people and hundreds of thousands of passengers.
Some opposition figures and radical protesters went even further to drum up ""Hong Kong independence"" and shouted slogans like ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times.""
As the situation worsened, the HKSAR government condemned the violent acts, called for law and order, and warned that extreme violence is pushing Hong Kong to a ""very dangerous situation.""
On Aug. 13, Lam said the most urgent task for Hong Kong at the moment is to stop violence and safeguard the rule of law, to prevent Hong Kong from sinking into ""an abyss and being smashed to pieces.""
""Only when all calm down, will genuine dialogue, fixing the rift and restoring social harmony, begin,"" Lam said.
On Aug. 20, Lam said the HKSAR government would start work immediately on building a platform for dialogue among all walks of life.
She hoped that all sides could show understanding and respect toward each other, and conduct dialogues openly and directly with people of all classes with different political stances and backgrounds, in a bid to find a way out for Hong Kong.
3. HOW DID HONG KONG POLICE REACT?
As protests often evolved into violence and assaults against police officers, Hong Kong police, facing tremendous pressure, had to fire tear gas and used batons to keep law and order on some occasions.
""We are responsive. If there are no violent charging at our check lines, no one attacking us, attacking our police station, we are not going to use force to stop it,"" Yeung Man-pun, a police officer of Kowloon City District, said on Aug. 16.
Over the past two months, radical and violent protesters repeatedly charged against police lines after marches and rallies. They wantonly blocked roads, vandalized public facilities, set fires on streets and in front of police stations, attacked police officers with iron bars, corrosive fluids, hurled bricks and petrol bombs.
Since early June, about 180 police officers have been injured and police stations were attacked over 75 times.
Still, police exercised great restraint when handling unlawful protests and only dispersed violent protesters with minimum use of force.
Chief Superintendent David Jordan said in an interview that the situation on the front line is the most dangerous that he has faced in over 25 years because of the level of aggression and violence.
Jordan, 52, serves as the Commandant of the Police Tactical Unit, a force for large-scale emergencies.
""We have been incredibly restrained, and also we are only reactive,"" Jordan said. ""I strongly feel that the role and the actions of the Hong Kong police have been as tolerant as any other police force on the planet would have been. A lot of other police forces would have acted far more productively and possibly aggressively against this kind of situation.""
Jordan said the police allow some disruption before they deploy, which is an incredible amount of tolerance for an international city police force.
The HKSAR government has firmly supported the police, saying the frontline force is under enormous pressure and facing unjust accusations of brutality.
4. HOW DOES CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SEE IT?
The central government authorities have demanded order be restored and violence be stopped.
The criminal activities blatantly challenged the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle and they must be punished by law, said Zhang Xiaoming, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, in early August.
Like many Hong Kong people have said, the ordinance amendment issue has changed in its essence and bears the features of a ""color revolution.""
The central authorities firmly support Chief Executive Carrie Lam in leading the HKSAR government's law-based governance, and they have confidence in Lam's wisdom and ability to handle the current situation in Hong Kong and lead the HKSAR government's administrative team to move forward and make further progress, Zhang said.
China's State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Wednesday said no responsible government or rule-of-law society would tolerate these acts, emphasizing that Hong Kong affairs are China's internal affairs and brook no interference by external forces.
5. WHAT CONSEQUENCES HAVE BEEN INCURRED?
Weeks of upheaval has undermined the social order and an already weak economy, with Hong Kong's retail, restaurants and tourism already hit hard.
The disorder has frayed Hong Kong residents' nerves and made lives difficult. Many small and medium-sized enterprises said they have suffered a 30-percent drop in earnings and pay cuts for employees in recent months, according to a survey.
The number of travelers to Hong Kong also dropped markedly. Nearly 30 countries or regions have issued travel warnings to Hong Kong.
The HKSAR government revised downward the real economic growth forecast for 2019 as a whole to 0 to 1 percent, from an earlier estimate of 2 to 3 percent.
The risk of an economic downturn in Hong Kong is significantly rising in the face of internal and external difficulties, said Paul Chan, HKSAR government financial secretary.
Investor confidence has been dampened, and companies have postponed plans of initial public offerings in Hong Kong.
On Aug. 15, the HKSAR government rolled out a package of measures to support enterprises and relieve people's financial burden, which will cost about 19.1 billion HK dollars (about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars).
""The Hong Kong economy is facing the risk of a downturn. We can see this from the data in the first half,"" said Lam, adding that the data in the first half has not fully reflected the severity of the problem."

Interview: Western media reports on Hong Kong biased -- German sinologist,"BONN, Germany, Aug. 20 (Xinhua) -- Germany's prestigious sinologist Wolfgang Kubin said on Tuesday that protests in Hong Kong were not peaceful since demonstrators occupied the airport and Western media have made biased reports.
Kubin, a tenured professor at the University of Bonn, told Xinhua that he doesn't agree with the German or international media reports that protests in Hong Kong were peaceful.
""Since they occupied the airport and did not allow passengers to check in and many flights had to be canceled, their protests were no longer peaceful but aggressive,"" said Kubin in an interview.
Kubin said Hong Kong police had exercised restraint and tolerance in the face of protestors. Although there were some problems, such as protestors getting injured, people need to look into the real causes, he added.
Questions should be asked like who started the fight first, he said, adding that protestors got injured in both the Yellow Vest protest in France and the anti-migration protest in Chemnitz, Germany last year.
Kubin said he believes that if the same protest takes place in Germany, the police ""would deal with it in two or three days and that the protestors would not be allowed to demonstrate at the airport.""
The sinologist said he was trying to see things in an objective way, but he and some other sinologists have found that many German and international media had shown obvious bias when reporting on Hong Kong.
""For example, a girl joining the protest got her eye injured, which many German media reported time and again. But in the Yellow Vest protest in France, about 1,000 people got eye injuries, and the German media had hardly reported. It is unfair!"" said Kubin.
The sinologist said he thought that many German and Western reporters have a kind of unconsciousness when it comes to China, which is deeply rooted in an ideological bias.
The problem originates from a longtime negative narrative of China in movies and stories that have made the public to accept the bad image of China unconsciously, Kubin said.
""I have got rid of the prejudice but many others have not. It is a psychological problem for them,"" said Kubin."
"Xinhua Headlines: Violence pales ""Pearl of the Orient"" economic outlook","by Xinhua writers Yi Ling, Fang Dong and Lou Chen
HONG KONG, Aug. 18 (Xinhua) -- As protracted violence roiled Hong Kong, the Asian financial hub -- known as the ""Pearl of the Orient"" -- faces a dimmed economic outlook in the coming months. Calls are mounting among the public for immediate actions to stop violence and restore order.
The demonstrations, which started over planned amendments to Hong Kong's ordinances concerning fugitive offenders, widened and turned violent over the past two months.
Protesters exhibited all manners of blatant destructive activities from blocking railways and tunnels, attacking police, defacing the national emblem and the national flag, to paralyzing the operations of Hong Kong International Airport, and brutally assaulting innocent people.
The flagrant violence has already taken a heavy toll on Hong Kong's already-weak economy.
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government revised downward the real economic growth forecast for 2019 as a whole to 0 to 1 percent, from an earlier estimate of 2 to 3 percent.
According to Paul Chan, the HKSAR government's financial secretary, the risk of Hong Kong experiencing an economic downturn is significantly rising in the face of internal and external difficulties.
He said the recent social incidents have hit retail, restaurants and tourism, worsening economic recession.
TOURISM HIT HARD
Hong Kong's tourism sector has turned from a summer boom into a chilly winter of unemployment and economic hardship, said Wong Ka-ngai, chairman of the Hong Kong Tour Guides General Union.
A pillar industry for Hong Kong, tourism employed more than 270,000 people, contributed 4.5 percent of GDP to Hong Kong's economy in 2017.
However, Wong said, the impact now is ""even worse than during the 2003 SARS outbreak.""
""Many mainland tourists don't have the desire to come to Hong Kong anymore. They make up almost 80 percent of our market,"" he said.
Since the violent protests began, more than 20 countries and regions have warned their residents against visiting Hong Kong.
In the June-July period, average earnings for tourism workers plunged by 74 percent, while the number of tours in Hong Kong fell 74 percent on average, according to a recent survey of 1,012 people with the union.
""The violence is taking a toll on our life and Hong Kong's economy,"" said Dicky Yip, a tour guide.
Yip, 46, has made no money over the last two months, leaving his wife as the only breadwinner for the family of six.
""About 80 percent of the group tours of my company come from the mainland, and most of them were canceled in the past two months,"" Yip said.
The tour guide said he had no work to do since July when he should have been busy taking tourists to popular locales such as Wong Tai Sin Temple, Victoria Peak and Repulse Bay.
""Violent activities by a small group of people hurt the image of Hong Kong as a whole in the eyes of tourists. It is not acceptable,"" Yip said.
SMALL BUSINESS CHILLS
The clashes initiated by radical groups have not only disturbed business and commercial order but have frayed Hong Kong residents' nerves and made lives difficult.
Siu Lau runs a pharmacy selling dried seafood and traditional Chinese medicines in Wanchai, the wealthiest district in Hong Kong. ""My shop has been open for more than 30 years. The recent turmoil caused a 50 percent drop in our business,"" he said.
Small and medium-sized businesses like Lau's account for 98 percent of the total number of Hong Kong businesses and contribute 40 percent of the HKSAR's employment.
""Most of our customers are regulars, some of them told me that they were not in the mood to shop,"" said Lau, 60, as he works with his wife in a 20-square-meter store.
Born and raised in Hong Kong, Lau was saddened by the series of violence that threaten to derail Hong Kong's economic future. ""The economy will keep going down if violent and lawless protests continue,"" he said with a sigh.
Dim-sum seller Ah Ling, in her fifties, complained about sliding sales. She works in a small shop selling snacks and drinks in Kwun Tong, the east of Kowloon peninsula, one of the most populated districts in Hong Kong.
""We are losing customers, as you can see, people don't have to queue up. It was nothing like what it was before. Sales keep dropping,"" she said.
The public in Hong Kong has been irked by escalated street violence and mob behaviors. Over 470,000 people gathered Saturday in a rally at Tamar Park to demand peace and stability.
Joe Chau Kwok-ming, chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Small and Medium Business, said the economic downturn is putting an extra squeeze on the small and medium-sized firms.
Many enterprises have seen a 30 percent drop in business and pay cut for employees in recent months. Chau warns that if the economy continues to deteriorate, there will be a wave of shop closures and the unemployment rate is bound to rise.
CALL FOR ORDER
A sound business environment is the backbone of Hong Kong's economy, derived from the rule of law, convenient transportation, a developed financial industry, efficient public service and the presence of international talent.
The current chaos has a direct impact on tourism, and business negotiations in the short term, but in a long run, it will threaten Hong Kong's role as the international financial and trade hub, said Witman Hung, an HKSAR deputy to the National People's Congress. 
""Finance always thrives in the safest place. When Hong Kong stops being safe, investors will have to think twice. Its appeal to high-end talent will fade away and the establishment as an innovation center will also be frustrated. The effects will be detrimental,"" Hung said.
The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong in its recent survey found that international businesses are already reporting serious consequences, ranging from an immediate hit to revenue caused by disruption to supply chains and consumption, to longer-term doubts over canceled events and shelved investments.
To prevent Hong Kong's economy from tanking, the HKSAR government on Thursday announced a package of economy-boosting measures with a total value of 19.1 billion HK dollars (about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars).
Measures range from waiving government fees and charges on enterprises for 12 months, introducing a new loan guarantee product for smaller companies to reducing salary tax, providing subsidies to school students and extra allowance for social security recipients.
Among the measures, an increase in the amount of personal income that's tax-free alone is estimated to cost 1.84 billion HK dollars (about 235 million U.S. dollars) and benefit 1.4 million people.
Paul Chan expressed the belief that the slew of economic stimulus measures will lead to a 0.3 percent economic growth.
According to HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam, the measures are designed to help small and medium-sized enterprises cope with the deteriorating economic situation and alleviate people's burden.
She stressed the most important task at the moment is to put an end to violence and restore social order. ""We all have a stake in Hong Kong.""

Commentary: Anson Chan's treacherous misdeeds in decimating Hong Kong,"BEIJING, Aug. 23 (Xinhua) -- As her misdeeds of betraying Hong Kong and her country continue to come to light, it has become increasingly clear that Hong Kong's former chief secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang is a major culprit in disarraying Hong Kong.
Chan, a former chief secretary of the Hong Kong government before Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, is an important pawn for anti-China forces in the West to meddle in Hong Kong affairs. 
Chan has been a chameleon political speculator.
After Hong Kong's return to the motherland, Chan served as chief secretary for administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government, pledging her loyalty to the HKSAR Basic Law, upholding the ""one country, two systems"" principle and professing her patriotism and love for the country and Hong Kong.
As her plan to become the HKSAR Chief Executive failed, however, she became uncooperative with the then chief executive.
As soon as she retired, Chan openly confronted the HKSAR government and the central government.
After she took up the Hong Kong Legislative Council seat, Chan even led Hong Kong opposition to stage all sorts of activities to create disorder and chaos under the guise of democracy.
Calling herself ""the conscience of Hong Kong,"" Chan carries in her pocket ""political black gold.""
Several Hong Kong media reports have disclosed that between 2013 and 2014 alone, Chan received 3.5 million Hong Kong dollars (446,000 U.S. dollars) in ""political contributions"" from media tycoon Jimmy Lai Chee-ying on three separate occasions for various activities to oppose the central government and incite chaos in Hong Kong.
Serving as a political tool for foreign powers to oppose China and cause chaos in Hong Kong, Chan met senior U.S. officials during Hong Kong's ""Occupy Central"" incident in 2014.
Chan has used the proposed amendments to the fugitive offenders ordinances in Hong Kong this year to repeat the same old trick.
Inviting foreign forces to intervene in Hong Kong affairs, she traveled to the other side of the ocean to meet with U.S. politicians including Vice President Mike Pence. She distorted the truth, wantonly spread rumors, created trouble, attacked Hong Kong's rule of law, and slandered the ""one country, two systems"" principle. 
During the radical protests and violence since June, Chan used her position as a senior former government official to incite strikes and demonstrations among serving civil servants, attempt to paralyze the operation of the HKSAR government and weaken the power of the Chief Executive.
In the face of public dissatisfaction with illegal violence, she concocted the fallacy that ""young people have no choice"" to justify and glorify radical atrocities.
Chan also instigated young people to defy the law while hiding herself in hotels with several other masterminds behind the chaos in Hong Kong for secret discussions with foreigners.
What Chan said and did was nothing but stirring up trouble and further escalating the turbulence in Hong Kong.
She has sacrificed the stability enjoyed by more than seven million Hong Kong citizens to meet her unfulfilled political ambitions.
In today's Hong Kong, such people who incite chaos, jeopardize Hong Kong's future and betray their nation will not be allowed to run amok."
"Feature: Hong Kong's stability, safety marred by prolonged violent protests","HONG KONG, Aug. 29 (Xinhua) -- A small television shop in Kwun Tong of China's Hong Kong has few customers, but the news programs on the screens kept attracting the attention of passersby.
A few elderly residents frowned at the video of black-clothed violent protesters felling a smart lamppost.
""It is so hard to imagine that this type of destruction happened in Hong Kong. I'm old, but these people are young. If Hong Kong continues to fester in violence, what good does it bring to them?"" asked a silver-haired man who gave his surname as Tsang.
Since June, violent protests have negatively impacted industries in Hong Kong and undermined the public sense of security and confidence in the future.
Police officers have been busy handling violent protests, leaving little time to respond to other emergencies.
""Now when we report a certain emergency to police, their response is slow because they have to handle all these protests,"" said Tsang.
By Aug. 28, 31 countries and regions have issued travel warnings to Hong Kong. According to the Safe Cities Index 2019, released by The Economist on Thursday, Hong Kong dropped to the 20th after ranking the ninth in 2017.
According to the figures provided by the Hong Kong police authorities, they handled 54,225 crimes in 2018, down 3.2 percent from 2017, the lowest since 1974. However, since June, violent incidents have erupted frequently. Officers were attacked and about 180 of them have been injured.
Many worry that the prolonged violence could further destabilize the development of Hong Kong.
Violent acts like smashing the smart lampposts undermined Hong Kong's efforts to build a smart and safe city, said Hung Kam-in, vice chairman of the Kwun Tong District Council.
""The impact of these protests is not only closing a few shops, but also has exacerbated a confrontational mindset that will hurt Hong Kong in the long run,"" he said.
""Repelling advanced technology will profoundly shake Hong Kong's status as an international metropolitan,"" he said."

"Commentary: Don't let violence ruin childhood, future of Hong Kong's next generation","by Xinhua writer Yang Dingdu
HONG KONG, Aug. 29 (Xinhua) -- Multiple videos of a boy leading protestors in shouting slogans on the streets of Hong Kong have become a cliche of protest publicity. Having a frenzied crowd follow a child's innocent voice may be quite a spectacle. But the question is: Did the boy really understand what he was doing?
The nefarious forces behind the prolonged protests in Hong Kong have been inciting teenagers, students and even children to charge onto the streets for their agenda. Among the suspects arrested for violent activities since June, many were young faces. One was only 12 years old.
As the new semester draws near on Sept. 1, organizers are openly calling for students to go on school strikes. Pamphlets urging students to walk out of class are everywhere.
Young people are the future of Hong Kong. Their voice carries weight and must be heard. Political schemers, however, have shamelessly misguided some young people's goodwill and passion into their divisive ideological movement, fanning violence, hatred and distrust that prevent any real solution.
Inciters know breaking the law has consequences. Yet they encourage the young people to go to the streets, block roads, vandalize public facilities, fight the police and even get arrested. They glorify violent acts and let the young believe that they are sacrificing themselves for something great.
There are many ways to love Hong Kong. Resorting to violence is not one of them.
With time and experience, young people will learn different perspectives and may see the agitators for who they really are. How sad it would be for them to come to regret one day the impulsive things they have done and having ruined their own future for someone else' political agenda.
Yet protest organizers do not care about young people's future. They put teenagers on the front to bear the brunt and take all the risks, while they themselves hide, conspire and agitate from behind. To them, teenagers and children are but a gear in the machine for building a movement toward their agenda.
Those who exploit the trust and passion of the young are despicable cowards. They must not be allowed to ruin the childhood and future of Hong Kong's next generation."

HK police warn of fake journalists at protest sites,"HONG KONG, Sept. 3 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong police warned on Tuesday that some people with ulterior motives may pretend to be news reporters at protest sites to obstruct law enforcement operations.
Chief Superintendent Tse Chun-chung of Police Public Relations Branch said at a briefing that the police dispersal operations in Mong Kok district on Monday night encountered the obstruction by a group of people, among whom were some dressed in yellow reflective vests like news reporters.
""In one flash point, while our officers were arresting a female, all of a sudden, a group of people, including some dressed in yellow reflective vests, surrounded and attacked our officers,"" Tse said.
Tse pointed out that the police have seized in past operations fake press passes, and some protesters have been seen ""disguise their identities by changing clothes, pretending to be anyone but a protester.""
Senior Superintendent Li Kwai-wah of Organized Crime and Triad Bureau said that those who use fake press passes at the protest sites may be liable to multiple criminal offenses, including the offence of using a false instrument.
According to Article 73 of Crimes Ordinance of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the offence of using a false instrument is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for 14 years.
Tse called on news reporters at protest sites to watch out for their own safety, avoid obstructing law enforcement operations, and report to the on-scene media liaison officers if they found anyone suspicious among the reporters.
""While we respect freedom of press, we have also come to an understanding with traditional media that professional journalism should not get in the way of police action,"" Tse said.

Classes began on Monday without disturbances, despite boycott calls from the opposition.

HONG KONG, Sept. 2 (Xinhua) -- School principal Wong Kam-Leung spread a message of peace, hard work and loving one's own country as he made his first-day-of-school speech.On Monday, 800 students and teachers gathered for a national flag-raising ceremony at a spacious hall of Wong Cho Bau School in the New Territories. Flag-raising at the beginning of a school year is its tradition.""It saddens me to see all the controversy and disturbances in Hong Kong over the summer. Those young people who threw a national flag into the sea must have very low respect for the flag and the country. Today's ceremony is significant. It teaches students to respect the country,"" he told a roomful of attendees.""We can only have a safe home and a nice place to study when we have a strong nation at our back. For Hong Kong to develop, it must integrate into the overall picture of the Chinese nation, and that is the way for young people in Hong Kong to find success in the future,"" he said.As students return to school, a handful of violent demonstrators disrupted the morning public commuting by blocking train doors.To avoid possible disturbances by riots, teachers arrived at the school early on Monday morning, said Sharon Yau, one of the 60 teachers at the school.""I can't help worrying about not being able to get to work, a traffic jam or a station shut down due to the protests.

"1,183 arrested over violence in Hong Kong since June: police","HONG KONG, Sept. 4 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong police arrested 35 people in violent protests in different parts of Hong Kong on Tuesday, bringing the total number of the arrested since June 9 to 1,183, the police told a media briefing on Wednesday.
Radical protesters committed violent acts in different parts of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon on Tuesday, including blocking roads, besieging the Mong Kok police station and damaging facilities at underground railway stations, said Chief Superintendent Tse Chun-chung of Police Public Relations Branch.

In an operation in Kowloon East area on Tuesday night, the police stopped a bus carrying dozens of radical protesters who had caused extensive damage to Wong Tai Sin MTR station, and arrested 33 people.
Senior Superintendent Foo Yat-ting of the police Kowloon East Region said these protesters were liable not only to the offense of contempt of court as they defied the injunction order for the MTR system, but also to offences such as criminal damage.
Likening the ongoing violent protests in Hong Kong to an infectious disease, Tse said the disease is ""spreading across the city and poisoning the minds of many young people.""
""There is certainly no quick cure to the disease. Every person in the society has a role to play in nursing Hong Kong back to health,"" he said, ""We sincerely appeal to every member of the public to join us.

Hong Kong police warn protesters over carrying guns,"HONG KONG, Sept. 2 (Xinhua) -- Carrying a gun, real or replica, could have dire consequences, a Hong Kong police spokesman warned protesters at a press conference on Monday.
When someone draws a gun, there is no way for police to tell if it's real or not. ""The police would respond with force if a gun is pointed at anyone. That could have the most severe consequences,"" said Tse Chun-chung, chief superintendent of the Hong Kong Police Public Relations Branch,
Carrying a gun is a criminal offense by itself, Tse said.
Tse also denied allegations that some gun-carrying protesters were police personnel in disguise, saying the guns carried by protesters were not used by the police.
""These vicious slanders are despicable attempts to smear police officers who act in strict accordance with the law."" 
Multiple gun-carrying rioters had been captured in photos and video footages of recent violent protests in Hong Kong.
Radicals threw more than 100 petrol bombs during the rioting on Saturday. The petrol bombs they used are becoming more powerful, causing longer and fiercer fires. ""Should a petrol bomb hit any resident, the consequences would be unthinkable,"" Mak Chin-ho, an assistant commissioner of police, told the press conference.
Rioters also committed arson on Saturday, setting fire on Hennessy Road, a major thoroughfare on the Hong Kong Island. They kept adding fuel into the massive flames, causing at least two explosions, said Mak.
Mak elaborated on Sunday's unlawful gathering where radical protesters disrupted transport to Hong Kong International Airport, forcing travellers to walk for miles to catch flights.
Some protesters put iron bars and other obstacles on the tracks of the Airport Express, vandalized metro stations and blocked roads with mills barriers and luggage trolleys, Mak said.
These protesters violated a court injunction against obstructing the proper use of the airport, and are liable for contempt of court, he said.
""These violent acts have no excuses. People who try to justify them are condoning violence,"" Mak said of the weekend's violent events.
A total of 159 people were arrested for the massive violence in Hong Kong at the weekend, bringing the number of total arrests to 1,117 since protests began in early June."

""When you start doing things that are of a very violent nature, you're going to lose the support of people. You're going to scare people. You're going to impact Hong Kong's economy, which is by the way now happening,"" the political science and geography professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio told Xinhua in an interview last week.
Focusing his research on China for more than 20 years, Taylor, also the department chair, has closely followed the recent development in Hong Kong.

""Any police officer would tell you if they're seeing threat to lives of not just individuals on the sidelines, but actual protesters themselves, let alone police officers, they're going to act. And anybody that doesn't understand that doesn't understand how police officers are supposed to operate to protect the public safety,"" he commented.
Speaking of the ""one country, two systems"" practice in Hong Kong, Taylor said the policy has been successful to maintain prosperity in the region over the past 20 years.
""It's been successful in encouraging and maintaining ... investments and investment opportunities"" in Hong Kong, he said."

The offenses of them, aged between 17 and 35, include unlawful assemblies, false imprisonment, participating in riots, disorder in public places, assaulting police, wounding, possession of offensive weapons and others.
The airport was paralyzed two days in a row as protesters flooded into the passenger terminal to stage a sit-in protest on Aug. 13, Lau said, adding that the protest quickly turned confrontational and violent as protesters unlawfully blocked passengers from boarding flights and harshly attacked some innocent visitors.
In relation to the incidents at the airport on Sept. 1, six people, aged between 20 and 26, have been arrested over offenses such as possession of instrument fit for unlawful purposes and intentionally endangering the safety of passengers by throwing objects upon railways.
Pointing out that ""the disruptive acts have extended to different transport hubs including the Hong Kong International Airport,"" Lau said the police are aware that some of the online comments are promoting another protest at the airport on Saturday by obstructing traffic to and around the airport.
The airport authority has obtained an injunction order from the court to restrain people from unlawfully and willfully obstructing or interfering with the proper use of the airport.
Lau reiterated that anyone in breach of the order is liable to the offense of contempt of court, and the police will fully support and provide all necessary assistance to the airport authority in enforcing the injunction order as well as access control measures at the airport.
Besides the injunction, the airport authority started access control measures for the terminal buildings at the airport on Aug. 14. Only passengers with a valid air ticket or boarding pass for a flight in the next 24 hours and a valid travel document, or airport staff with relevant identification document will be allowed to enter the terminal buildings.
Lau said the police noticed that some netizens talked about making fake tickets to pretend as passengers to enter the terminal, and warned that this may constitute the offense of using a false instrument, with a maximum penalty of 14-year imprisonment.
Lau stressed that the injunction order also covers the roads connecting to the airport, and if drivers intentionally drive slowly to obstruct traffic, they may be liable to careless driving and dangerous driving under the road traffic ordinance.
""The airport is an essential infrastructure catering to travelers from all around the world,"" he said, ""The police will closely monitor the situation and make respective deployment tomorrow."""

"Hong Kong media applaud first community dialogue between gov't officials, residents","HONG KONG, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government held its first community dialogue on Thursday evening, which local media saw as a first step to ease social tension and restore public confidence.
HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam and four secretaries of the HKSAR government had candid talks with about 130 representatives of the public at Queen Elizabeth Stadium in Wan Chai on Thursday.
An editorial carried by the Wen Wei Po said that Hong Kong society was seriously torn apart by the prolonged violent protests. Under such circumstances, the HKSAR government showed its sincerity and willingness to shoulder responsibility by listening to different voices and even harsh criticism, which was the first step to replace confrontation with communication, and bridge the rift through dialogue.
The Hong Kong Commercial Daily pointed out in an opinion piece that people in Hong Kong, after months of chaos and violence, wished for restoration of social order. The dialogue was a good way to ease social tensions, and could help rebuild public confidence.
According to a commentary by the Sing Tao Daily, stopping violence and enhancing dialogue are the constructive measures for Hong Kong's future development. It saw the dialogue as a platform where people could exchange ideas and think in others' position, something that could never be achieved by using violence.
It was noted in the commentary that the biggest problem in Hong Kong currently was radical violence that undermined the rule of law, hurt local economy and affected people's normal life. Only through dialogue could Hong Kong find a solution.
Hong Kong Economic Times said in an editorial that the community dialogue was a first step to ease social tension, adding that the HKSAR government should show its sincerity, determination and capability with real action.
In early September, Lam made a televised speech, proposing four actions to turn around the current difficult situation, including to initiate community dialogues starting this month."

The Asian trading and financial hub has been plagued since June by unrest that originated from protests over the proposed ordinance amendments concerning fugitive offenders transfers.
Although the HKSAR government reiterated that the amendments were meant to protect the law-abiding general public in Hong Kong and business activities from the threat of crime, and now has withdrawn the amendments, violence continues as protesters have veered off their original agenda, causing a split in the society and taking a heavy toll on the economy.
It takes decades of hard work of the people to build Hong Kong into a world-class financial center, Norman Chan, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said.
However, the recent turmoil has weakened investors' confidence in Hong Kong and the spirit of the rule of law, which had long been the foundation of the Hong Kong's global status, Norman Chan said, urging an end to violence to create conditions for effective dialogues to find solutions.
Hundreds of professionals from sectors including construction, planning, and engineering co-signed a statement on a newspaper on Monday to express their sorrow and concern over the continued social unrest.

Though the HKSAR government has withdrawn the amendments, violence continued as protesters veered off its original agenda, causing a split in society and taking a heavy toll on the economy."

(Xinhua/Liu Dawei)""Seclusion brings no development opportunity for Hong Kong,"" said economist Lau Pui-King. ""Some youngsters don't understand that Hong Kong would be even worse if it is secluded from the Chinese mainland.""
""To come out of the current economic difficulty, Hong Kong needs to be linked with the Chinese mainland much closer and more effectively,"" she said.HONG KONG, Sept. 7 (Xinhua) -- Kwong loves the pure adrenaline rush he gets when he takes his motorcycle out on the weekends to light up his lackluster life.The 35-year-old lives with his parents in an old and cramped apartment in the New Territories of Hong Kong. He has a girlfriend but is hesitant to get married and start a family.""The rent is so high, and there is no way I can afford an apartment,"" said Kwong, who earns 15,000 HK dollars (1,950 U.S. dollars) a month. Renting a 30-square meter one-bedroom apartment would cost him about two-thirds of his salary.""Future? I don't think much about it, just passing each day as it is,"" he said.Kwong's words reflect the grievances among many people in Hong Kong, particularly the young. Many vented their discontent in prolonged streets protests that have rocked Hong Kong since June.The demonstrations, which started over two planned amendments to Hong Kong's ordinances concerning fugitive offenders, widened and turned violent over the past months.""After more than two months of social unrest, it is obvious to many that discontentment extends far beyond the bill,"" said Carrie Lam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), referring to the now-withdrawn amendments.To Lam, the discontent covers political, economic and social issues, including the often-mentioned problems relating to housing and land supply, income distribution, social justice and mobility and opportunities, for the public to be fully engaged in the HKSAR government's decision-making.""We can discuss all these issues in our new dialogue platform,"" she said.UNAFFORDABLE HOUSESFor nine straight years, housing in Hong Kong has been ranked as the least affordable in the world. Homes in the city got further out of reach for most residents, according to Demographia, an urban planning policy consultancy. The city's median property price climbed to 7.16 million HK dollars in 2019, or 20.9 times the median household income in 2018, up from 19.4 times from a year earlier.In the latest case of house transaction, an apartment of 353 square feet (about 33 square meters) at Mong Kok in central Kowloon was sold at 5.2 million HK dollars in September, according to the registered data from Centaline Property Agency Limited.For those fortunate enough to have bought an apartment, many have to spend a large part of their monthly income on a mortgage. For those who have not bought any property yet, it is common to spend more than 10,000 HK dollars in rent, while saving every penny up for a multi-million HK dollar down payment.From 2004 to 2018, the property price increased by 4.4 fold, while income stagnated, statistics show. From 2008 to 2017, average real wage growth in Hong Kong was merely 0.1 percent, according to a global wage report by the International Labor Organization. Homeownership dropped from 53 percent to 48.9 percent from 2003 to 2018.HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam visits a transitional housing project of the Lok Sin Tong Benevolent Society Kowloon in Hong Kong, south China, Aug. 9, 2019. (Xinhua)Efforts of the HKSAR government to increase land supply to stem home prices from soaring also went futile amid endless quarrels. Of Hong Kong's total 1,100 square kilometers of land area, only 24.3 percent has been developed, with land for residential use accounting for a mere 6.9 percent, according to data from the HKSAR government.Social worker Jack Wong, 29, lives in an apartment bought by his parents. ""I'm lucky. Most of my friends still have to share apartments with their parents. My cousin has been married for seven years, but he is still saving for his down payment, so he has to live at his parents' house,"" he said.""The older generation changed from having nothing to having something. We, the younger generation, thought we had something, but it turns out we have nothing,"" he said.MIDDLE CLASS' ANXIETYWhile young people complain about having few opportunities for upward mobility, Hong Kong's middle class, which should have long been stalwarts of the society, are under great economic pressure and in fear of falling behind.It is not easy to be middle class in Hong Kong, one of the world's most expensive cities. To join the rank, a household needs to earn at least 55,000 HK dollars, or 7,000 U.S. dollars, a month, according to Paul Yip Siu-fai, a senior lecturer at the University of Hong Kong. About 10 percent of the households in the city are up to the rank.Earning that much can be counted as rich in many parts of the world. But in Hong Kong, the money is still tight if you have a child to raise and elderly to support.Housing is the biggest burden for the average middle-class resident. The cost of having a child is another headache in Hong Kong, where pricey extra-curricular activities and private tutoring are considered necessary to win in the fierce competition.Fears of descending to the low-income group are real for the middle class. Many think they belong to the middle class only in education and cultural identity, but their living conditions are not much better than the impoverished, said Anthony Cheung Bing-leung, former secretary for transport and housing of the HKSAR government.A light show is on at Victoria Harbour in Hong Kong, south China, Dec. 1, 2017. (Xinhua/Wang Xi)Civil servants and teachers, who earn much more than the average income, are traditionally considered middle class. But Cheung found out in a survey that many of them could not afford to have their own apartment, with some even living in the narrow rooms of partitioned apartments.""We don't belong to the low-income group, but we could just rent an apartment now,"" said Lee, a teacher at a secondary school in Hong Kong.Lee and her husband earned nearly 1.3 million HK dollars a year, but a 50-square meter apartment is the best they could rent now for a five-member family. She preferred not to give her full name as she feels her situation is embarrassing.""We want to save more money to buy a house near prestigious elementary schools for our kids,"" Lee said. ""If our kids can't go to a good school, it'll be very tough in the future.""
CHANGING ECONOMIC STRUCTUREIn the 1970s, nearly half of Hong Kong's labor force were industrial workers when manufacturing thrived in Hong Kong. During the 1980s, Hong Kong's finance, shipping, trade and logistics and service industries started to boom.Since then, the economic landscape began to change amid subsequent industrial upgrading.A woman walks near the Harbour City in Hong Kong, south China, Aug. 27, 2019.  (Xinhua/Li Gang)Due to the hollowing out of the manufacturing industry, the wealth gap in Hong Kong widened and the class division worsened. Despite the prosperity of finance, trade and tourism in recent years, more than 1.37 million people are living below the poverty line in Hong Kong, home to more than 7 million.Working career options are now limited, leaving little hope for the youngsters to move up the social ranks.As a result, Hong Kong's social class has largely been solidified in the 21st century, with the richest people dominated by property developers and their families.The Gini coefficient, which measures the inequality of income distribution, reached a new high of 0.539 in 2016, far above the warning level of 0.4, according to data by the HKSAR government's Census and Statistics Department. The greater the number toward one, the more inequal in income distribution.   Though the HKSAR government tried to narrow the wealth gap, many people in Hong Kong said they are not sharing the fruits of economic prosperity, the young and those low-income groups in particular.STAGNATING POLITICAL BARRIERSWhat makes the deep-seated problems in Hong Kong such a hard nut to crack? The reason is complicated, according to observers, partly due to the containment in the current political structure that leads to governance difficulty, partly due to a doctrinaire implementation of the principle of ""small government, big market,"" or laisser faire, and most importantly due to the opposition's ""say no for none's sake"" that stirs political confrontation and sends Hong Kong into a dilemma of discussions without decisions, or making decisions without execution.Over the past 22 years, the successive HKSAR governments have tried many times to tackle these problems by rolling out affordable housing programs and narrowing the rich-poor gap.For example, to make houses more affordable, Tung Chee-hwa, the first HKSAR chief executive, proposed in 1997 to build at least 85,000 flats every year in the public and private sectors, raise the homeownership rate to 70 percent in 10 years and reduce the average waiting time for public rental housing to three years.Such plans, however, went aborted as home prices plunged in Hong Kong amid the Asian financial crisis in 1998.""Since Hong Kong's return, many economic and livelihood issues would not be as politicized as they are now, should the HKSAR government have introduced more policies and better social security arrangements to address those problems,"" said Tian Feilong, a law expert of the ""one country, two systems"" center with the Beijing-based Beihang University.To carry out major policies or push forward major bills, the HKSAR government needs to garner the support of two-thirds majority at the Legislative Council (LegCo).The HKSAR government's previous motions, be it economic policies or fiscal appropriations, were impeded by the opposition time and again at the LegCo, regardless of the interests of the majority of Hong Kong residents and the long-term development of the society.The HKSAR government sought in 2012 to establish the Innovation and Technology Bureau to ride the global wave of innovative startups, diversify its economic structure and bring more opportunities for young people. Such efforts, however, were obstructed by the opposition at the LegCo in defiance of repeated calls by the public. After three years, the proposal to create the bureau was finally passed by the LegCo.Vehicles run on the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, Oct. 24, 2018. (Xinhua/Liang Xu)In another case, a Hong Kong resident, incited by the opposition, appealed in 2010 for a judicial review of the construction plan of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. Though the HKSAR government won the lawsuit after more than a year of court proceedings, 6.5 billion HK dollars of taxpayers' money had been wasted in the increased construction costs of the bridge's Hong Kong section due to the delay.As time passed, problems remained unsolved, so did public discontent.Repeated political bickering stalled Hong Kong's social progress amid the sparring, and the opposition created a false target and blamed the Chinese mainland for those deep-seated problems.Lau Pui-King, an economist in Hong Kong, snubbed the opposition's resistance of or even antagonism to the Chinese mainland, saying such thinking of secluding Hong Kong from the entire country could end nowhere but push the city down an abyss.""Seclusion brings no development opportunity for Hong Kong,"" Lau said. ""Some youngsters don't understand that Hong Kong would be even worse if it is secluded from the Chinese mainland.""""To come out of the current economic difficulty, Hong Kong needs to be linked with the Chinese mainland much closer and more effectively,"" she said."

Foreign legislatures should not interfere in internal affairs of China's Hong Kong: SAR gov't,"HONG KONG, Sept. 18 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government on Wednesday reiterated that foreign legislatures should not interfere in any form in the internal affairs of the HKSAR.
The reiteration was made in response to the serious and unfounded allegations made by some Hong Kong people on recent violent protests in Hong Kong and their request for the U.S. Congress to pass the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act at a hearing of the United States Congressional-Executive Commission on China on Tuesday.
The spokesman said that since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the HKSAR has been exercising ""Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong"" and a high degree of autonomy in strict accordance with the Basic Law. The ""one country, two systems"" principle has been fully and successfully implemented. Human rights and freedoms in Hong Kong are fully protected by the Basic Law, the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and other legislation. The SAR government attaches great importance to these and is determined to safeguard them.
In the past few months, there has been a series of protests in Hong Kong with continuous escalation of violence. In various districts, protesters committed extensive destructive acts such as hurling petrol bombs, setting fires and paralyzing traffic. The Police have been exercising a high level of restraint and have been carrying out enforcement actions in strict accordance with the law, the spokesman said.
The police's enforcement actions are to restore public order as soon as possible and to protect the life and property of the general public. The SAR government has reiterated that it fully supports the police to strictly enforce the law and bring offenders to justice, the spokesman added.
The SAR government absolutely respects the public's freedoms and rights of assembly, procession and expression. The police will continue to fully facilitate the conduct of peaceful and rational public events by members of the public."

Commentary: Hong Kong needs dialogue for a way out,"HONG KONG, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- Some 130 Hong Kong residents joined top officials of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), including Chief Executive Carrie Lam, in a candid conversation Thursday night.
It was the first ""community dialogue"" for Lam and other top officials to listen to the voices of the people, a step forward in addressing deep-rooted social problems and grievances.
Unrest has gripped Hong Kong for more than three months since protests began in June, bringing severe damage to the region. It is the broad consensus of the people of Hong Kong to end violence and restore peace and order.
In addition to responding sternly to violence and crimes, it is imperative to address the deep-seated problems in politics, people's wellbeing and the economy in order to find a way out of the impasse in Hong Kong.
Representatives at the dialogue spoke their minds regardless of their backgrounds or political stances while Lam listened quietly with humility, just as she had promised.
Those who spoke at the meeting came from a pool of tens of thousands of people who applied. Their participation showed the people of Hong Kong are willing to talk.
During the dialogue, some people voiced opinions different from those of the HKSAR government. However, a peaceful, calm and rational atmosphere was maintained to make communication possible.
Through the ""community dialogue"" initiative, Lam and the HKSAR government have shown sincerity and goodwill, which deserves to be taken seriously given the current situation. In addition, the opportunity opened up by the dialogue initiative to heal wounds and bridge differences also ought to be cherished by all Hong Kong people.
The rule of law, peace and order, as well as rationality, are shared values of the residents of Hong Kong, who hope to see dialogue prevail over conflicts, peace over violence and reason over prejudice.

"Smearing Hong Kong police as ""dirty cops"" is world's biggest conspiracy: police deputy commissioner","HONG KONG, Sept. 28 (Xinhua) -- Lau Yip-shing, deputy commissioner of police of the Hong Kong Police Force, has called the attempt to smear the Hong Kong police as ""dirty cops"" as the biggest conspiracy and lie in the world.
In an internal letter to the police dated Sept. 19, Lau said since his return to the police force in August, he faced a society full of hatred, rift and instability with his colleagues every day, and together they handled the worst and most unruly riots in Hong Kong's history.
""The past six weeks have been one of the hardest, most worrying, but most glorious days of my life,"" Lau said.
Ill-intentioned people continued to spread rumors and distort facts, with an aim to discredit the police, undermine the good relationship between Hong Kong residents and the police, and incite hatred for more riots in the society, which in turn damaged the governance and security in Hong Kong, he said.
""There is no 'dirty cops'. It's a false accusation,"" Lau said, adding that Hong Kong's most pressing need is to put an end to chaos and root out all unrest and hatred.
Lau thanked the 30,000 police officers for their efforts to maintain social order in Hong Kong, and hoped the force could keep the morale and eradicate the roots of hatred and riots, and restore peace in Hong Kong.

2nd LD Writethru: 8 injured as rioters escalate violence in Hong Kong,"HONG KONG, Sept. 15 (Xinhua) -- At least eight people were injured on Sunday as rioters escalated violence by setting fires, throwing petrol bombs, beating innocent residents and blocking roads on the Hong Kong Island.
A video clip on social media showed that a man in blue shirt fainted after being surrounded and beaten by a group of black-clad rioters on a road on the Hong Kong Island.
TV footage showed that the man's face and back were in heavy bruises. Paramedics arrived later and stretchered him onto an ambulance.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority said at around 6:00 p.m., a 49-year-old man was injured in Sunday's public event on the Hong Kong Island and was admitted to Ruttonjee Hospital in critical condition.
It updated at around 9 p.m. local time that the man's condition turned from critical to serious and was transferred to Queen Mary Hospital for further treatment.
Xinhua reporters witnessed a man being beaten and kicked by a group of rioters dressed in black at a crossing in Wan Chai. TV footage showed another white-clad man lying on the ground with blood on his face and arms after being attacked by rioters in North Point.
As of 9 p.m., eight people were injured in the public events on the Hong Kong Island, according to the hospital authority.
An illegal rally on the Hong Kong Island turned violent again on Sunday afternoon, as rioters began throwing petrol bombs in the areas around the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government offices and the Legislative Council (LegCo) building at about 4:30 p.m. local time and vandalized mass transit railway (MTR) stations.
Earlier TV footage showed that some radical protesters set fires to the Chinese national flag and a banner marking the founding of the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.
Before the violence erupted, radical protesters blocked several main roads in Central, Admiralty and Wan Chai areas, seriously obstructing road traffic on the Hong Kong Island.
Admiralty, Wan Chai and Causeway Bay MTR stations were forced to close after rioters smashed the glass inside, damaged and obstructed MTR exits in escalating violence. Some exits at several other stations were also closed.
As repeated warnings to protesters who posed a serious threat to police officers and the public turned futile, the Hong Kong police deployed tear gas and specialized crowd management vehicles in dispersal operations in the Central and Admiralty areas.
The protesters then moved eastward and gathered at multiple locations in Wan Chai, Causeway Bay and North Point areas, causing a number of violent clashes.
The police warned the protesters to leave immediately and reminded the public to avoid travelling to these areas.
The LegCo Secretariat issued a red alert Sunday afternoon and required all people to evacuate the LegCo Complex immediately.
A number of stores in the once busy shopping areas in Causeway Bay, Wan Chai and Admiralty were forced to shut down Sunday afternoon.
The police said the radical protesters were participating in an unauthorized assembly and their acts have seriously threatened the safety of the people at the scenes, warning them to stop their illegal acts immediately.
Since June, Hong Kong has suffered from escalating violence that originated from protests over proposed ordinance amendments concerning fugitive offenders. Prolonged unrest has hit the city's economy, and divided friends, colleagues and even families.
Unprecedented scenes of violence have been playing out in Hong Kong over the past months. Black-clad protesters vandalizing metro stations, setting fires on streets, and attacking police with petrol bombs and bricks have become common occurrences."
Hong Kong police refutes LegCo member's accusations at UNHRC,"HONG KONG, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong police on Tuesday refuted accusations made by a member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo) at the Human Rights Council of United Nations (UNHRC) regarding the police's law enforcement operations since June.
Expressing deep regret about the accusations made by Tanya Chan at UNHRC on Monday, a police spokesperson said that in face of the increasingly tense protests with an escalation of violence since June, the Hong Kong police always exercise a high level of restraint and endeavor to restore public order and to protect the safety of the general public.
The spokesperson said that in Hong Kong there are stringent police guidelines for the use of force, and the force to be used by the police shall be the minimum force necessary for achieving a lawful purpose.
""Ms Chan mentioned the rights of detainees and police procedures of custodial searches. We must emphasize that we always respect detainees' rights and will arrange for the detainees to communicate with relatives and lawyers as soon as possible, given that there is no unreasonable delay or hindrance to the investigation or administration of justice,"" the spokesperson said.
""Also, police will not obstruct any person from receiving medical treatment during investigation in a hospital or any operation. We also respect patients' privacy and any right a person should be entitled to,"" the spokesperson added.
""As for Ms Chan's accusation about detainees being harassed and humiliated by police, we have clarified repeatedly that we have not received any formal reports or complaints. We take such groundless accusations very seriously and doubt the source of information,"" the spokesperson said, adding that the police appeal to anyone who has concrete evidence to make a report so that the police can follow up and investigate.
Chan also accused police officers of shooting bean bag rounds at a female, causing blindness in one of her eyes. ""The police seriously point out that this case is still under investigation and a judicial process. Before there is any investigation finding, no one should make any reckless conclusion,"" the spokesperson said."
"Xinhua Headlines: Malicious slanders widen rifts, fuel violence in Hong Kong","HONG KONG, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Persistent rumors and fake news have exacerbated social tensions and whipped up violent activities in Hong Kong over the past three months.
Much of the misinformation has been used by radical protesters as pretexts to resort to more violence, slander police and government authorities, and stir up hatred. Hong Kong authorities have made tremendous efforts to provide the facts and stop people from engaging in speculation.
A large part of the daily press conferences held by the Hong Kong police was spent on clarifying various types of unfounded comments about police operations. Though police spokespersons repeatedly refuted these allegations, some media chose not to believe in facts but stuck to their own perspectives.
Recently, the opposition and radicals spread rumors about the protester death at Prince Edward MTR station on Aug. 31. Taking this claim as an excuse, radical protesters surrounded and attacked the Mong Kok police station, and went so far to attempt setting up a ""mourning hall"" at the MTR station.
On Tuesday, a joint press conference by the police, hospital authority and fire department laid bare the facts, saying neither Mong Kok Police Station nor the police missing persons unit had received any report of missing persons in connection with the incident on Aug. 31.
A total of 53 people were arrested at Prince Edward MTR station on the night of Aug. 31, including seven people who needed to be sent to hospitals for treatment.
The opposition hyped up another incident that a female police officer had strip-searched a female protester for 15 to 30 minutes. The Hong Kong police then clarified that they checked related documents and the CCTV record, and found that the level of the search was not the ""3C"" level which requires a strip search; the whole search took four minutes.
Deliberately misinterpreting photos and videos of police operations is another common practice to cook up false accusations against police. A photo of a police officer ""hitting"" non-protesters with his shield had been widely used as proof of police brutality. Video footage later revealed that the officer was holding his shield up to protect passersby as he escorted them out of the danger zone.
During a demonstration in Sheung Shui, a protester tried to jump from a six-meter footbridge to flee the police but was saved by several riot police officers who rushed to hold him. The photo was put online but captioned wrongfully saying the police were trying to push the protester off the bridge.
Agitation and mud-slinging against officers have been recurrent. During a protest at Tsuen Wan on Aug. 25, some violent protesters hurled petrol bombs at the police. However, CNN released a story headlined ""Police use petrol bombs and water cannons against Hong Kong protesters,"" citing a widely circulated tampered video. CNN later apologized for its ""erroneous"" headline and replaced it with a correct one.
In another broadly circulated photo, a rioter carrying a gun on his waist was throwing a petrol bomb at the police on Aug. 31. However, the picture was used by the opposition as an ""evidence"" of police personnel disguise as protestors.
In response, the police denied the allegation and said the police did not use the gun carried by the protester. ""These vicious slanders are despicable attempts to smear police officers who act in strict accordance with the law,"" said Tse Chun-chung, chief superintendent of the Hong Kong Police Public Relations Branch.
The opposition can be very ""creative"" in smearing the Hong Kong police and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government, including the ""smart lamppost"" conspiracy, in which the lampposts installed to collect air, traffic and weather data were said to be ""monitoring"" protesters.
The government had explained that the cameras of the lampposts are set to face public areas only and do not carry any facial recognition function. Rioters nevertheless took down one lamppost and damaged 19 others. The total repair fees amounted to 2.8 million Hong Kong dollars (about 360,000 U.S. dollars).
Misleading information has been rife on social media in recent days in an attempt to sow fear among the public and attack the police and the government. Without a punishment scheme in place against fake news, many local media have actively disseminated false information and flooded the public with a misinformation storm.
Local residents said the rumors are unfounded and some are absurd. ""The protesters not only said people died in the Prince Edward MTR station. They said they saw a ghost. They are insane,"" said a resident surnamed Lee who lives nearby.
""Both the hospitals and the police have published their reports saying no person died at the station. Why should I not trust the authorities, and get led away by these rumors?"" said another resident surnamed Kwan.
""These rioters occupied roads and smashed MTR stations. Ordinary people can not take the metro. They dare not go out in public on weekends. The rioters say this is all for the future; what future do they have if they keep causing so much damage to Hong Kong?"" Kwan asked.
Last weekend, rioters sabotaged Central, Wan Chai, Causeway Bay MTR stations in escalated violence, targeting people with different views, police stations and public facilities, police officers said.
Police authorities have launched ten anti-violence hotlines to collect information, including photos, audio and video clips via WhatsApp to assist in the prevention and detection of possible crimes.
The increasing number of negative, violent and fake information has exacerbated social tensions, said Yip Siu Fai, a professor at the University of Hong Kong.
At a press conference Tuesday, HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam urged the public to carefully discern the information they received.
The HKSAR government will try its best to provide a timely account of information and facts, Lam said, adding that a special section has been set up on the government's website to clarify rumors at a timely manner."
"2nd LD Writethru: Radical demonstrators set fires on roads, MTR exit in central Hong Kong","HONG KONG, Sept. 8 (Xinhua) -- Some radical demonstrators set fires on roads and at least one exit of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) in the central areas of Hong Kong Sunday afternoon, as prolonged protests continued to disrupt traffic and cause chaos here for the third month.
Rioters smashed windows, obstructed escalators and vandalized facilities at the MTR Central station before starting the arson at one of the exits, forcing the close-down of the station.
They also built barricades with dismantled road railings, trash bins and other miscellaneous objects on streets in Central and Admiralty areas.
Huge smokes billowed into the sky before fire fighters came and extinguished the fire.
As the police carried out dispersal operations in Central and Admiralty districts, some demonstrators headed to Wan Chai and Causeway Bay, blocking carriageways in the areas and paralyzing traffic.
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government's Transport Department announced Sunday evening that several road sections on Hong Kong Island were temporarily blocked to all traffic, and the services of 18 bus routes were suspended and over 60 routes were truncated or diverted.
The MTR announced in the evening that Central and Wan Chai stations were temporarily closed because of an escalation of the situation in the stations.
The police said they have deployed tear gas and used appropriate force to disperse radical demonstrators in Causeway Bay.
The police appealed to everyone on site to leave immediately and condemned all violent acts by rioters. Residents of the areas were advised to stay tuned to the latest situation and if necessary keep their windows shut and stay indoors.
Later on Sunday night, some radical protesters blocked carriageways in Mong Kok, Kowloon, by setting up barricades with trash bins and debris, paralyzing the traffic.
Some protesters hurled hard objects into Mong Kok police station, posing a safety threat to members of the public and police officers at scene.
The nearby Prince Edward and Mong Kok MTR stations were temporarily closed due to the violence.
The police warned the protesters to stop all illegal acts and leave immediately. After repeated warnings in vain, the police started to disperse the protesters."
Hong Kong Airlines slashes flights amid disruptive protests,"HONG KONG, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Airlines has axed seven percent of flights from September to December, the company said Tuesday, as unabated protests wreak havoc in the transportation hub of Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong-based airline said in a statement emailed to Xinhua that it also reduced its capacity, or available seats on its air routes, by nine percent during the period.
It attributed the cuts to a sharp decline in travel demand due to ""recurring issues in Hong Kong,"" adding that it would continue to monitor the situation closely for further adjustments.
Months of unrest have taken a heavy toll on tourism in Hong Kong, which saw the number of visitors plummet by nearly 40 percent in the tourist rush season of August, said Paul Chan, the financial secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government.
The Hong Kong International Airport, whose operation has been constantly disrupted by rallies, recorded a yearly decline of 12.4 percent in passenger volume last month, according to Hong Kong's airport authority."
"Spotlight: Foreign leaders, analysts call for Hong Kong's return to normalcy under ""one country, two systems""","HONG KONG, Oct. 25 (Xinhua) -- Government officials and political analysts of many countries around the world have expressed concern with the ongoing violence in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), and called for a return to normalcy as early as possible under the ""one country, two systems"" framework.
Lee Hsien Loong, Singaporean prime minister, said at the Forbes Global CEO Conference last week that Singapore looks at the Hong Kong situation with concern, as Singapore thrives best in a stable region where other economies are prospering and Singapore can continue to do business with them.
The major demands put forward by the Hong Kong demonstrators are not meant to solve Hong Kong's problems, but are ""intended to humiliate and bring down the government,"" Lee pointed out, adding that as a special administrative region of China, Hong Kong has to ""live and work"" within the framework of the HKSAR basic law.
Before progress can be made in solving Hong Kong's problems, it is necessary for ""temperatures to come down"" first so that people can work together, the prime minister said.
In an article carried by the Straits Times on Tuesday, Tommy Koh, ambassador-at-large at Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that Hong Kong protesters' violent behavior has brought discredit to their movement, and also damaged Hong Kong's economy and reputation as a safe and efficient global city.
It is unreasonable for the protest movement to expect the HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam to accept all its demands, Koh pointed out.
In another article published by the newspaper on Monday, Ker Sin Tze, Singapore's consul-general in HKSAR from 2008 to 2012, said that the ""one country, two systems"" principle was a brilliant and pragmatic arrangement that enabled the Sino-British negotiations to be concluded, paving the way for a smooth handover of Hong Kong to China.
While China is obliged under the handover agreement to allow the ""two systems"" to run for 50 years, there appears to be no reciprocal obligation on the part of Britain and its allies, including anti-China Hong Kong residents, to live up to the commitments to ""one country"", he wrote, pointing out that this imbalance is starkly captured in the protesters' acts of vandalism against the Chinese national flag and emblem.
Like the Singaporean officials, government officials of Cambodia, Timor Leste, Myanmar and Laos, among other countries, also expressed support for the one-China principle and emphasized that the problems in Hong Kong are China's internal affairs and should be resolved by China under the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
Foreign Minister of Timor Leste Dionisio da Costa Babo Soares said whatever happens in Hong Kong is a matter for the Chinese government to resolve because Hong Kong is part of China, adding that Timor Leste encourages continuous dialogues in resolving the issue and calls for the rule of law being respected.
Myanmar Union Minister for International Cooperation U Kyaw Tin said that Myanmar strongly supports the one-China policy and ""one country, two systems"" principle, and he hopes Hong Kong could succeed in its efforts to restore peace, stability, the rule of law and people's normal life.
Vilay Lakhamfong, secretary for the Lao People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee and Minister of Public Security, said the Lao government has been deeply concerned about the escalating violence in Hong Kong.
Laos firmly supports the Chinese government's position in dealing with the Hong Kong issue and its measures in stopping violence, restoring order and opposing outside forces' meddling in its internal affairs, he said, adding that Laos wishes to see Hong Kong maintain its stability and prosperity.
Spokesperson of the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Le Thi Thu Hang said that Vietnam is concerned that recent developments in the HKSAR have had negative impacts on the socio-economic life of Hong Kong people, and emphasized that it is necessary to restore order and stabilize the situation.
Cambodian government chief spokesman Phay Siphan said that violent protesters in Hong Kong should stop their outlawed actions and respect the decision of the majority of Hong Kong people who want peace, stability and further development.
The protesters should try to find solutions to the problems through legal ways rather than illegal protests, Siphan said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua, stressing that ""action on the streets is not the choice.""
The ""one country, two systems"" principle has worked well in Hong Kong and under the principle people in Hong Kong have lived in peace, stability, and prosperity, Siphan pointed out, slamming certain Western countries for interfering in China's internal affairs under the pretext of democracy and human rights.
The Cambodian spokesman's remarks about foreign interference in Hong Kong affairs were echoed by many political observers and analysts around the globe.
Khan Mohammad Daneshjo, Afghan political observer and veteran journalist told Xinhua in an interview, ""No doubt, the hegemonic powers are behind the violent protests in Hong Kong to undermine the investment in the financial hub -- Hong Kong -- and gradually destabilize the People's Republic of China.""
UAE newspaper Al Bayan pointed out in a recent report that ""some foreign forces are trying to destabilize the situation in Hong Kong, undermine the credibility of (HKSAR) government and cause regional turmoil, in order to achieve their special strategic interests.""
In one of its recent commentary articles, Egyptian official newspaper Al Ahram said that any impartial observation of the situation in China's HKSAR will easily discern the obvious role played by the United States in fomenting the protests and the interest it seeks.
The United States has linked the situation in Hong Kong to the trade war with China, which fully demonstrates that the United States does not want to see the Hong Kong issue solved, but seeks to use the protests in Hong Kong to exert pressure on China and safeguard its own interests, the newspaper pointed out.
Russian news website gazeta.ru said in a recent report that the recent passage of the so-called ""Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act"" at the U.S. House has imposed more tension to the U.S.-China relations.
The report quoted Alexei Maslov, head of the Oriental Studies Department of the Russian Higher School of Economics Research University, as saying that the discussion and passage of the Hong Kong-related bill at the U.S. Congress is a ""premeditated act"", and ""the purpose of the United States is to make China surrounded by all kinds of landmines and exhausted by dealing with them.
Wilson Lee Flores, analyst and columnist of Philippine Star, said that the U.S. House's passing of the bill is unnecessary, wrong and dangerous, because it risks further encouraging the vicious cycle of violent protests now plaguing Hong Kong.
""It is tantamount to throwing more fuel on the fire of crisis, instead of helping to resolve it.""
The U.S. bill is also morally wrong and smacks of arrogant, neo-colonial foreign interference in the domestic affairs of another country, thus violating the norms and ethics of international law, he said.
The blatant meddling by the U.S. Congress over an autonomous territory of China may poison the now tenuous and troubled but once vibrant bilateral relationship between the world's two biggest economies, thus also endangering global economic stability and peace, he warned.
He urged the United States and all other civilized nations to promote social harmony, stability, nonstop reforms and inclusive progress in the uncertain world, instead of unnecessarily encouraging radicalization of social angst and myriad problems into paroxysm of violence, lawlessness, the breakdown of the social compact between governments and people, and uncontrollable anarchy."
Roundup: San Francisco groups protest U.S. passage of Hong Kong-related bill,"SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 17 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of three advocacy groups in San Francisco Bay Area Wednesday protested U.S. interference in the internal affairs of China's Hong Kong and presented a ""letter of opposition to H.R.3289"" to the office of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi here.
""The prolonged rioting of four months has made life dangerous, intolerable and uncertain for residents of and visitors to Hong Kong,"" according to the protest letter.
It accused some U.S. lawmakers of instigating dissension and indirectly encouraging illegal protests and violence (in Hong Kong), instead of urging calm and peace.
""We urge the lawmakers to pay attention to our own domestic problems such as homelessness, inadequate health care, climate change, housing crisis in metropolitan cities, and rising poverty level,"" said the protest letter.
John Walsh, a representative of East Bay Chapter 162 of Veterans for Peace (VFP), a global organization advocating world peace, said the Hong Kong-related bill, or H.R.3289, which was passed in the lower chamber of Congress on Tuesday, ""definitely did not reflect the opinions of the general public of the United States.""
He said he supported the other two groups, Chinese-Americans for Peace, a local grassroots organization, and Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association (CCBA), the largest and oldest organization in San Francisco's Chinatown, in presenting the protest letter to the office of Pelosi, who represents San Francisco in the U.S. Congress.
The United States has been interfering in the internal affairs of Hong Kong through organizations funded by the U.S. government, such as the U.S. National Endowment for Democracy, he said.
""What kind of an attitude is that? That's very hypocritical. Non-interventionism, not intervening in the affairs of another country should be a U.S. policy,"" Walsh stressed.
Chu Wen Huang, presiding chairman of the CCBA in San Francisco, told Xinhua that the bill was not based on facts and that the U.S. government has turned a blind eye to the rioters in Hong Kong who attacked Hong Kong police officers and destroyed public facilities.
The bill was not aimed at helping the Hong Kong Special Administration Region (HKSAR) government resolve problems, but rather intends to sanction Hong Kong, he said.
""We must not allow foreign forces to meddle in the affairs of Hong Kong and strongly demanded the U.S. Congress withdraw the bill,"" Huang said.
Leon Chow, vice president of the Committee to Promote the Reunification Of China San Francisco Bay Area Chapter, who was one of the representatives delivering the protest letter, described the escalating violence committed by some rioters in Hong Kong as something smacking of terrorism.
""The U.S. legislators should not have passed a Hong Kong-related bill without solid information about the true reality in the city,"" Chow said.
On Wednesday, the National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, strongly condemned the U.S. House of Representatives' passing of the Hong Kong-related bill.
The move constituted ""blatant interference in Hong Kong affairs and gross intervention in China's internal affairs,"" the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee said in a statement."
Hong Kong police strongly condemn violence over weekend,"HONG KONG, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police on Monday strongly condemned the unlawful and violent protests staged Sunday in Kowloon amid the months-long unrest that has plunged Hong Kong into chaos.
Not long after the unauthorized demonstration began around 1:30 p.m. local time in Tsim Sha Tsui despite police's objection, rioters used miscellaneous objects to set up barricades, committed arson and vandalism, wrecking private and public properties.
Some even prized up metal gates of restaurants and bank outlets and vandalized and set fire therein. ""Such acts completely disregard law,"" the police said in a statement.
The violent thugs also hurled scores of fire bombs at mass transit railway (MTR) stations and police stations, and set ablaze road blocks erected by them. The rioters' acts of arson ""seriously threatened the safety of everyone at the scene, posing danger to members of the public in the vicinity, as fire might spread to residence nearby,"" the police said.
The police said they used tear gas, rubber bullets and 40mm react rounds, among others, to deter the increasingly intensified violence. A water cannon vehicle was deployed in the afternoon to disperse the rioters.
In the dispersal operation, the water cannon vehicle accidentally sprayed colored water onto the front gate of the Kowloon Mosque. The police said they immediately contacted the persons in charge to clarify the situation, adding that they ""respect religious freedom and will strive to protect all places of worship.""
Meanwhile, the police said they found several suspected objects during Sunday's violent protests. The explosive disposal team safely handled a suspected bomb near Tong Mi Road and Lai Chi Kok Road and no one was injured.
""No violent behavior will be tolerated,"" the police reiterated, saying they will take resolute enforcement actions to maintain public order and bring all lawbreakers to justice."
Commentary: Time to bring rule of law to Hong Kong cyberspace,"HONG KONG, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) -- It is no secret that social network platforms in Hong Kong such as LIHKG and Telegram have played a major role in the city's prolonged unrest.
Unfortunately, they have gone far beyond mere communication platforms and have become breeding grounds for violence, rumors and illegal activities.
As stopping the violence is a top priority for the battered city, it is time for Hong Kong authorities to bring cyberspace under the rule of law to stop the proliferation of extreme, false and hate-infused speech and false information that have long misled its citizens, especially the youth.
For instance, potentially lethal and heinous topics such as how to make bombs to attack and even kill police are discussed publicly on these platforms, where rioters are also being provided with ""pre-combat training"" and encouraged to destroy public and private facilities. Sadly, the ""lessons"" taught online are being actualized in a brutal reality.
These platforms have also been a hotbed for groundless rumors like ""arrested women sexually assaulted by the police"" and ""death at the Prince Edward MTR station on August 31"" to stir up hatred against the police and vindicate violence, which has led to the doxxing and bullying of police officers and harassment of their families, including young children.
Cyberspace has already grown from an information-sharing platform into a tool with a significant influence on the thinking and values of the youth of today. For the so-called ""leaderless"" turbulence in Hong Kong, cyberspace has in fact played a dominant role in misleading the youth and disrupting social order.
Freedom of speech certainly protects the individuals' right to articulate their unpopular or non-mainstream opinions, but this does not mean such freedom has no boundaries. In fact, threatening and insulting others, fomenting hatred and blatantly planning violent activities have crossed far beyond the line of what is acceptable under the banner of free speech.
Such behaviors are nothing more than unsolicited attacks on others' freedom of expression and a fierce deterrence to others who would disagree.
Order cannot be established if there are no boundaries drawn, and true freedom cannot be guaranteed if there are no limitations marked. Only when normal order is put in place for online communication and self-expression can genuine freedom be realized in cyberspace.
Cyberspace should not be allowed to become a lawless frontier, and therefore must be brought under the rule of law.
It is also a global consensus that cyberspace governance needs to be exercised through legislation. Germany, as a case in point, adopted the Network Enforcement Act in 2017 and has taken nationwide action to fight against hate speech online.
Indeed, broad-spectrum efforts are still required to help Hong Kong society resume social order and stability. However, in the face of the rampaging rumors and odious violence happening today, it is imperative for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to rein in inflammatory remarks that might result in social turmoil, curb the circulation of fake posts and accelerate legislation aimed at establishing norms of behavior in cyberspace.
Violence organized through the internet deludes the ordinary people and disrupts society. This ""cancer"" must be removed at the earliest possible juncture to ensure cyberspace won't descend into a hotbed for rumors, further stoking the violent protests that have created such turmoil."
