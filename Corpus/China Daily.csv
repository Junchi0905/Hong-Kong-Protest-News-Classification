Violence flares as HK protests start 9th week,"Policeman hospitalized with leg burns; large groups of residents thank officers
Separate protests were held in various parts of Hong Kong on Sunday as the demonstrations entered their ninth week, while large groups of Hong Kong residents visited several police stations over the weekend to express their firm support and respect for the police force.
On Sunday, a radical protestor hit a police officer with a gasoline bomb, and Commissioner of Police Lo Wai-chung later visited the officer, who had been hospitalized for burn wounds on his legs.
A resident surnamed Chan, who visited Kwai Chung Police Station with his wife and son on Saturday, said: ""The police have been working really hard to safeguard social order. We came here to show our support."" The boy gave the police a handwritten card.
Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, visited on Friday the Wong Tai Sin Police Station and dormitory, which had been attacked by radical protesters. Lam thanked the police officers for their hard work to safeguard the Hong Kong public.
The HKSAR government and police condemned the illegal assemblies and said police will strictly enforce the law against all violent and illegal acts.
Protesters who break the law should be brought to justice, the government stressed.
The police reiterated that anyone participating in an unauthorized assembly will be committing an offense.
Security at the Sham Shui Po Police Station had been strengthened as protesters turned out on Sunday for a banned rally in the district in the afternoon. They soon occupied Cheung Sha Wan Road and set up barriers along the main thoroughfare. Others surrounded the police station and, ignoring a police warning to disperse, targeted officers with laser pointers.
At about the same time on the other side of the financial hub, demonstrators dressed mostly in black gathered in Victoria Park. Some were seen waving American flags.
After a brief peaceful demonstration, they left the park to take over Hennessy Road, a major thoroughfare in the heart of the shopping district in Causeway Bay, blocking traffic and disturbing tourists. In hit-and-run tactics, they also went to Wan Chai, taking similar actions.
Those protesters face the risk of arrest because they deviated from the planned rally's location.
Under Hong Kong's Public Order Ordinance, participating in an unlawful assembly is punishable by five years' imprisonment, and rioting carries a maximum penalty of 10 years.
Also on Sunday, demonstrators continued to occupy the Hong Kong International Airport arrivals hall for a third day.
Riot suspect grounded 
In a separate development, the city's major airline, Cathy Pacific, confirmed on Saturday that a Hong Kong pilot charged with rioting for taking part in a recent protest has been grounded.
On Friday, the embattled airline received a warning from the Civil Aviation Administration of China, the national aviation regulator, over the possible safety risk the pilot posed and queries from passengers and the public.
The airline also confirmed that two of its employees had been dismissed for misconduct.
In Beijing, the Foreign Ministry urged the United Kingdom to stop interfering in China's internal affairs and to refrain from making random, inflammatory accusations regarding Hong Kong.
The refutation came after the British Foreign Office said that new Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab spoke by telephone on Friday with Lam about the situation in Hong Kong.
""I'd like to point out that Hong Kong today is a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China. Long gone are the days when it was under British colonial rule,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Saturday.

Bruce Lee's broad appeal still holds,"It's a reflection of Bruce Lee's transcendent appeal that he continues to inspire people on both sides of the Pacific Ocean even 46 years after his untimely death. The United States, the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong were central to his powerful hybrid identity. In many ways, Bruce Lee is a man of the moment, a man for the paradoxical times we live in. As a fighter on and off the screen, he knew a thing or two about conflict: when to stand up, when to stand down, when to walk away.
In the 1960s he was a first-generation jetsetter, bridging the Pacific Ocean at a time when jets had just begun to edge out the older, slow propeller planes for long-haul travel. As a Chinese living in the US, and as an American living in Hong Kong, he epitomized the integrated ""Chimerica"" complex we live in today. A bicultural exemplar, he beat a path from Hollywood to Hong Kong and back, bringing American technique to Chinese films, and the practice and philosophy of Chinese martial arts to US screens, fight clubs and gyms.
He inspired Chinese, still uncertain of their place in an inequitable world, to be proud of themselves, but at the same time, he also inspired people of all races with his inclusive teaching and accessible presentation of traditional Chinese wisdom.
The quibbling, quarreling world today is in dire need of the kind of rounded, yin-yang wisdom epitomized by Lee in his prime, whether in regard to racial harmony, the US-China trade war, or the violent protests in Hong Kong.
Lee is best remembered as a rugged individual, a man of uncanny self-confidence whose passion for the martial arts and spiritual self-mastery was evident to all who knew him.
When American film director Quentin Tarantino took to the screen to poke fun at Bruce Lee by mocking his personality and martial arts prowess in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, the reaction of fans, family, friends, former sparring partners and film boards was swift and furious.
Kareem Abdul Jabbar, a former student of Lee and a legend in his own right, wrote a nuanced commentary in which he defended the right of Tarantino to invent, exaggerate and distort the truth in the name of art, but also said, emphatically, that propagating deliberate lies and deceptive depictions of real people is not just in bad taste, but puts a blur on the historical record.
Bruce Lee as played by Mike Moh is creditable as far as these things go; there's an uncanny resemblance and he got the accent down. True, the fists flew much too slowly to be vintage Lee, and Brad Pitt's counterattack was even more implausible, but that's pretty much par for the course in Hollywood.
What critics of the film took offense to was the plot. The director used Lee as a chump and disposable sidekick to a charming Caucasian lead. As Lee's daughter Shannon explained in Variety magazine, her father was forever being ""marginalized and treated like a kind of a nuisance of a human being by white Hollywood, which is how he's treated in the film"".
Now, Lee's name is being invoked by the violent protesters in Hong Kong. Consider these dueling headlines from the South China Morning Post: ""Hong Kong protests embrace Bruce Lee but reject Jackie Chan in tale of two martial arts heroes"", and ""Hong Kong protesters have lost the plot: Bruce Lee said 'be water, my friend', not 'be stupid'"".
Protesters claim Bruce Lee lineage for their ""be like water"" street-fighting tactics. The likeness of Lee continues to pop up on T-shirts and on the so-called Lennon Walls where the Hong Kong protesters post messages. No one can say for sure which side he would have come down on, but based on his sturdy East-West bridge building, it is likely he would refuse the binary choice of taking sides and look for ways out of the conflict. As Walt Whitman said, the individual contains multitudes.
Bruce Lee retains broad appeal. A bridge between East and West in his life, driven to combat the demons of chauvinism on both sides, his spirit continues to transcend boundaries. It's a testament to the lasting power of his ideas, and life example, that nearly half a century after his untimely death, he is still a part of the conversation.

HK protests weighing on job market,"Experts say it's harder to lure overseas talent, some positions may be diverted
Protracted protests are weighing on Hong Kong's job market as recruiters are finding it more difficult to attract overseas talent to work in the city and expatriates are considering leaving.
""Some companies have halted their hiring programs in Hong Kong amid the lingering protests as they wait on the sidelines to monitor market developments,"" said Simon Lee Siu-po, co-director of Chinese University of Hong Kong's International Business and Chinese Enterprise Program.
""Enterprises now think there will be political risk involved in relocating their staff to Hong Kong,"" Lee said, and if the turmoil is not settled in the near future, ""some job positions may be diverted elsewhere"".
Because of the continuing unrest, some companies have canceled or delayed training programs scheduled to be held in Hong Kong, he added.
Hong Kong is in its 12th week of protests, which were initially sparked by an extradition amendment bill, although the bill has since been suspended. Multinational companies are holding off on business expansion in Hong Kong, making them less eager to send overseas talent to the city.
However, Lee says Hong Kong is still attractive as a regional talent hub given its good institutional attributes such as the rule of law, free flow of information and low levels of corruption.
If the government will seize the opportunity to solve long-term structural problems such as wealth disparity and affordable housing when the turmoil is settled, the city can quickly restore its economic vigor and attract talent once again, Lee said.
Concerns about safety in Hong Kong are leading some job candidates from abroad to choose other destinations.
""Some overseas talent decided to take job offers in Shanghai due to personal safety considerations,"" said Alexa Chow Yee-ping, managing director of Hong Kong-based AMAC Human Resources Consultants.
Even when stability is restored, overseas workers might still need another half year or so to gauge whether the city is stable enough for career development, Chow said.
""I am worried that even local talent may consider leaving the city,"" she added.
Armstrong Lee, managing director of Worldwide Consulting Group, said about 20 to 30 percent of companies are slowing their pace of recruitment, mostly affecting mid-level posts.
Gloria Leung, chief executive of ExcelNet Total HR Solutions, said nearly 10 percent of foreign companies in Hong Kong have put a freeze on hiring since late June.
Although reasons for the freeze were not cited, Leung said it showed employers have become unnerved by the city's continuing turmoil.
Margaret Fung, TMF Group's managing director for Hong Kong, said, ""As a leading provider of international business administration services, we are constantly sensing the market and its dynamics, and we will continue to observe it in case the situation changes.""

"HK needs to restore public order, now","There is a dreary dismal familiarity to me in watching the progression of the continuing Hong Kong riots. They could be following exactly the same script as the protests that rocked the West in the late 1960s.
At first, the protests begin as apparently peaceful, orderly and dignified, but they never stay that way for too long.
For the protesters are never satisfied by reasonable concessions and dignified compromises on the part of the authorities. Instead, slowly but inexorably, the protests descend into the primeval language of bestial hate and emotional hysteria.
The ""requests"" for ""concessions"" first grow into ""demands"". Then those ""demands"" invariably and inevitably widen. They become impossible to concede. And even if the government does concede them, the response is only to demand even more wide ranging ones. Eventually, the protesters' ""demands"" become so incoherent, sweeping and inarticulate, filled with hatred and rage that it is impossible to even define them, let alone continue to grant them.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been remarkably restrained in their use of force so far. At the time of writing, there have been no fatalities as a direct result of police using of force. One protester fell or was pushed off the roof of a building. It is not even known by whom. Another man who had an argument with protesters was set on fire by the extreme ones and is in critical condition. A third who was shot this week by police may or may not die.
Yet James Palmer writing in the ""Foreign Policy"" web platform on Nov 11 had no hesitation in predicting that more deaths would follow and that they would all be the fault of the Chinese authorities. ""Police brutality is brutalizing its victims,"" he wrote.
It is certain that Palmer would never dare to allege that police brutality in the United States was brutalizing the families and communities of its victims. Yet more than 1,000 people - many of them harmless and unarmed - are killed in US police shootings every year, according to data bases published by The Washington Post and The Guardian in Britain.
In 2015, The Guardian counted 1,146 deaths at police hands in the US and in 2016, they counted 1,093 deaths. The Washington Post database reported 995 deaths for 2015, 963 for 2016 and 976 for 2017. At the time of writing, the Post reported 783 such deaths for this year.
From 1965 through the end of the decade outbursts of similar student violence threatened the stability and (so it seemed) survival of societies throughout the West.
But wherever those protests got out of hand - especially in the United States and in my native Northern Ireland - the authorities responded unhesitatingly with direct security crackdowns. Inevitably, the repressions that followed in countries around the world were far harsher than the regimes that the outraged protesters were raging against.
There should be no surprise as this process relentlessly unfolds. For it is the very credibility of the government itself and its capability to provide security for its people that is being challenged. Ultimately, it is the very survival of the government and its moral duty to protect its people that is being targeted.
This is true even if the population at risk is the tiny 1.5 million of Northern Ireland under the indirect rule of Britain in 1969.
The Chinese people have enjoyed a security and prosperity unprecedented in their entire history over the past four decades. The very creation of Hong Kong after the first Opium War grew directly out of the smashing of the credibility and military power of China's ruling Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) by Britain and France in the notorious Opium War of 1840-42. Its return to China on July 1, 1997, has therefore always been emblematic of China's terrible ""Century of Powerlessness"" - and of the new and better age that at last succeeded it.
The national consensus among the Chinese people to keep their nation unified and peaceful, safe and strong is therefore a deeply rooted and profound one.
It is vital that peace is restored in Hong Kong and law and order are maintained for the greater good. The rioters therefore need to be warned clearly in advance what the consequences of their continued lawless, violent actions will be.
The cowardly hypocrites who urge them on from thousands of miles away are only going to have blood on their own hands: Far too much of it.

US act adding fuel to the Hong Kong fire,"Editor's Note: The US Congress has made the passing of the ""Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019"" introduced by Congress members in June a top priority, while over the weekend some demonstrators in Hong Kong urged the US Congress to approve the law. Three experts share their views on the issue with China Daily's Liu Jianna. Excerpts follow:
US interference in China's internal affair unacceptable
One country paying attention to another country's human rights conditions and helping it promote human rights may not be a bad thing, because human rights are universal values and the common goal of the people of all countries. But what measures should a country take to protect and promote human rights are absolutely its own business, because only that country has the right and duty to safeguard human rights within its boundaries.
Besides, only the country in question can take into consideration the domestic realities, which the outside world more often than not ignores, to ensure the protection and smooth and orderly promotion of human rights.
By introducing the ""Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act"", which is a direct interference in China's internal affairs, the United States has not only violated China's sovereignty, but also called into question the very concept of human rights and freedom.
Worse, the US has openly supported the violators who have contravened the very human rights they claim to pursue by attacking police officers and police stations and other government facilities and unleashing indiscriminate violence in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
Obviously, human rights and freedom, in the true sense of the terms, are not what the US preaches. Which means Washington is seeking to encourage the demonstrators to continue the mayhem in Hong Kong and widen the divisions in the city.
Lu Zhian, a researcher at the Research Center for Human Rights, Fudan University
HK unrest reflects rise of populism
This is not the first time, and it certainly won't be the last, that the US Congress is trying to push through such an act, thanks to the businesspeople represented by the US president, ""missionaries"" such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and ""soldiers"" like Vice-President Mike Pence. The missionaries, for example, believe that what is good for the US is good for the world, and therefore blindly export US values to the rest of the world.
Before the midterm elections, the US leader could call the shots and silence the Democrats. But now that the Democrats have got a majority in the House of Representatives, partisan politics has kicked in.
In fact, the unrest in Hong Kong is a continuation of the populism that has besieged the other two international financial centers, New York and London, in the past as reflected in the Occupy Wall Street movement and Brexit.
Yet some forces in the US hope that by helping escalate the violence in Hong Kong, they will force the Chinese central government to deal with the demonstrators with an iron hand to restore order in the city, which would give them an opportunity to label China as an enemy of human rights and ask the international community to join Washington in boycotting it.
The more restrained has been the central government's response, the more anxious these forces have become. As a result, they are trying increasingly aggressive ways to provoke China. But instead of linking the Hong Kong demonstrations with the Sino-US trade war, Washington should strive to ink a trade deal with China at the next round of trade talks in October in order to avoid further complicating the issue.
Wang Yiwei, Jean Monnet chair professor at Renmin University of China
'Color revolution' not possible in China
As a self-proclaimed human rights champion, the US is adept at airing its views on almost every issue, especially on issues in which China is involved. For instance, the US Congress has passed many acts related to China's human rights record.
Yet by brazenly endorsing the acts of some Hong Kong demonstrators who have unleashed violence in Hong Kong, and ignoring the restraint the Hong Kong and central governments have shown, the US has betrayed its ulterior motives.
The Hong Kong insurrectionists' aim is to stage another ""color revolution"", but even they know that they cannot succeed in their evil design. And by introducing the so-called Hong Kong human rights act, the US Congress will add fuel to the fire in Hong Kong. This should prompt China to take immediate measures to stop the US and other Western countries from interfering in its internal affairs.

HK dialogue doesn't mean condoning violence,"Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said on Tuesday the government would spare no efforts in establishing a platform to conduct dialogue with the people of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, regardless of their ideological stances, in order to find a way out of the political impasse.
Speaking to journalists before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lam emphasized that the initiative should not be seen as condoning the violence, which escalated during protests over the weekend. The government has zero tolerance for violence regardless of the circumstances and political motives, and it is committed to bringing perpetrators to justice, she said.
""Starting a dialogue does not mean we should condone violence. Just imagine under the pretext of communication that we tolerate all forms of violence in Hong Kong. That would be the end of the rule of law in Hong Kong,"" Lam said.
Lam's remarks came after she and SAR government officials engaged in talks with different groups twice over the past few days - one with high-profile community leaders and the other with mainly youth representatives. She declined to disclose details of the talks or identify the participants, but mentioned that she had reiterated the reasons behind the government's objection to establishing an independent investigation commission, which is one of the protesters' key demands.
Her remarks came after the city endured the 12th weekend of violent protests against the now-abandoned extradition bill. In the most recent disturbances, radical protesters attacked police officers with gasoline bombs and bricks at multiple locations in Kowloon, and sabotaged 20 multifunctional lampposts that were part of the smart city project.
Noting that schools would be in session soon, Lam strongly denounced protesters' harassment of police officers' families, especially their school-age children.
""For the families of my police colleagues, I just do not see the association of the protests and the protesters' demands with the harassment of police families,"" Lam said.
""And I hope every one of us, the education sector especially, takes into account the bullying and harassment of children. And not just those in police families, but children everywhere,"" she added.
Underage protesters 
Fifteen juvenile protesters, aged between 12 and 15, have been arrested for roles in the protests that were originally against the now-abandoned extradition bill, police said on Tuesday.
According to police, offenses include unlawful assembly, assaulting a police officer, obstructing a police officer, loitering, possession of offensive weapons and possession of instruments fit for unlawful purposes.
One 12-year-old boy who was arrested is believed to have just finished his elementary schooling.
Li Chi-lam, principal of Lingnan Hang Yee Memorial Secondary School, confirmed on social media that a student at the school was arrested on Sunday.
Under the Juvenile Offenders Ordinance, no child aged between 10 and 13 can be sentenced to imprisonment; and no one aged between 14 and 15 can be sentenced to imprisonment if that person can be suitably dealt with in any other way.
Ho Hon-kuen, chairman of professional association Education Convergence, said he was saddened to see juveniles taking part in illegal assemblies. He added the incident raised a red flag in the education sector and should bring about in-depth reflection on liberal studies.

US Navy port calls canceled in Hong Kong,"Warships' visits untimely, would send wrong signal to protesters, experts say
Experts said requests for port visits in Hong Kong by the US Navy are untimely and inconvenient given the massive protests plaguing the special administrative region as violent radicals have intensified their attacks on police, obstructed public transport and commerce and threatened local residents' lives and properties.
The Chinese government has the right to review and approve foreign naval warships' port call requests on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the principles of national sovereignty and development of circumstances at the time, experts said.
The United States Pacific Fleet's deputy spokesman, Nate Christensen, said on Tuesday that China has denied scheduled port visits in Hong Kong by the amphibious transport dock ship USS Green Bay for Saturday and by the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Erie in September.
US naval ships arriving now would send an ""extremely dangerous and wrong"" signal to Hong Kong's rioters that their actions have the support of the US military, thus stirring up new trouble and escalating tension to perilous heights, the experts added.
The last US warships to visit Hong Kong were the USS Blue Ridge amphibious command ship and the US Coast Guard Cutter Bertholf in April. Last week, the US State Department issued an advisory warning urging travelers to Hong Kong to ""exercise increased caution"" due to ""confrontational protests"".
Port calls often serve as a barometer of China-US ties. Last year, China canceled the visit to Hong Kong of amphibious assault ship USS Wasp after Washington approved a $330 million sale of military equipment to Taiwan and sanctioned the Chinese military over a Russian arms deal.
In 2016, aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis and four ships in its strike group were denied port visits to Hong Kong after the US criticized China's activities in the South China Sea. China also denied similar visits by US warships in 2014 and 2007.
Warship port calls to Hong Kong are defense and diplomatic affairs that require special permission by the central government in Beijing, according to the Basic Law of the HKSAR. The Hong Kong government is tasked with hosting and carrying out the details of such events.
Port call activities typically consist of diplomatic exchanges, repairs, refueling, restocking of supplies and local tours, shopping and other friendly and relaxing activities. The Consulate General of the United States in Hong Kong and Macao is tasked with submitting requests and other information regarding US naval port calls.
Li Haidong, a professor of US studies at China Foreign Affairs University, said the US Navy has a long track record of port visits to Hong Kong given its strategic location, and requests for such visits must be submitted in advance.
""Hong Kong has been in turmoil for months now. Coincidence or not, the US Navy couldn't have picked a more terrible time for a port call. It feels highly suspicious and does not take the feelings of the Chinese people into consideration,"" Li said.
""There is no way the US military doesn't know the situation in Hong Kong, especially when mounting evidence shows US meddling in China's domestic affairs,"" he said. ""US warships visiting now would inevitably send a very dangerous message in support of the rioters, which is detrimental to the city's peace and stability.""
China has repeatedly accused the US of interfering in Hong Kong affairs and urged it to stop. While the US has denied the accusations, US politicians and media have frequently slandered efforts by Beijing and the Hong Kong police to maintain social order and voiced their support for the protesters.
""The chaos in Hong Kong has US fingerprints all over it,"" Li said. ""The US is hoping to turn Hong Kong into another source of leverage it can use to pressure China. China highly values Sino-US ties, but this relationship must be built on the bedrock of the US respecting China's sovereignty.""
Yuan Zheng, director of US foreign relations research at the Institute of American Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the US has been a major external force fueling the current turmoil in Hong Kong by funding and training protestors, as well as whitewashing their violent actions.
""Denying port visits means China is very displeased with the deep US involvement in its domestic affairs,"" Yuan said.

Overriding task in Hong Kong is 'to stop violence',"Challenging 'one country, two systems' principle will not be tolerated, official says at symposium
The central government will not sit by if the situation in Hong Kong deteriorates to a point that Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government cannot handle, Zhang Xiaoming, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said at a symposium in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, on Wednesday.
The central government has sufficient capabilities to quickly quell possible unrest as empowered by the Basic Law of Hong Kong, Zhang said.
""The most pressing and overriding task at present is to stop violence, end the chaos and restore order, so as to safeguard our homeland and prevent Hong Kong from sinking into an abyss,"" Zhang said, adding it is facing ""the most serious situation"" since its return to the motherland in 1997.
Speaking to about 550 dignitaries from a wide cross-section of Hong Kong society, Zhang said the central government is highly concerned about the situation in the city and is closely following developments there.
Zhang's remarks followed two earlier news conferences by the office to voice concerns about the turmoil in Hong Kong. Since June 9, anti-extradition bill protests have not only grown bigger and more widespread, but have also become more violent.
Radical protesters vandalized public buildings, besieged police stations and desecrated the national emblem and the national flag. Any act challenging the ""one country, two systems"" bottom line will not be tolerated, Zhang said.
Bringing peace and order back to Hong Kong is a shared aspiration of the majority of the people, Zhang said. The key to navigating out of turmoil is to support Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and the police in enforcing the law strictly and sternly, he said.
Patriotic forces can also play a pivotal role in steering the city out of the storm as they are a main force in safeguarding stability and prosperity, Zhang added.
Key representatives attending the symposium included Hong Kong lawmakers, deputies to the National People's Congress and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and members of central government institutions in Hong Kong.
Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong SAR Wang Zhimin and Yang Jianping, deputy director of the office, also attended the symposium.
Zhang's comments were exactly what was needed to boost the confidence and morale of patriots, Wang said.
He added that Hong Kong is experiencing a crucial battle that concerns the city's destiny and future. Putting an end to violence is the city's top priority and also the common aspiration and the most urgent demand of the city's people, he said.
Calling for unswerving support for the SAR's chief executive and the government, Wang also encouraged the public to firmly support the police in their enforcement of the law.
The demonstrations in Hong Kong have evolved into radical and violent activities that seriously violate law and jeopardize the city's security and order, and any responsible government will not sit idly by in the face of such violent transgressions of the law, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Wednesday.
Rebuking the remarks made by some US politicians that if Beijing enforces martial law in Hong Kong, the US will reevaluate its relationship with China, Hua said such words are confusing what's right with what's wrong.
""I want to ask these people, do you still remember how the US police dealt with the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011? If Hong Kong's radical, violent and illegal activities happened in the US, what would the US police do?"" Hua said.
The central government firmly supports Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor in leading the Hong Kong government to administer the SAR according to law, as well as the Hong Kong police in strictly enforcing law, Hua said.
Any attempt to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs and China's internal affairs is doomed to fail, she said.
Speaking after attending the morning session of the full-day symposium, Margaret Chan Fung Fu-chun, former director-general of the World Health Organization, said she could barely recognize the city now.
Chan, who was born and raised in Hong Kong, said the city had suffered sustained violent attacks on its rule of law by a small group of people who attacked those holding different views from their own.
The success of Hong Kong as an international metropolis is built on the respect for different voices and on resolving differences through dialogue, she said.
She said in her 25 years as a civil servant in the colonial government, she had never seen so many people allowed to protest on the streets - something that never would have been possible without the guarantees of the Basic Law and the ""one country, two systems"".
Tam Yiu-chung, a Hong Kong member of the NPC Standing Committee, said the loud and clear message he heard from the symposium was that the ""one country, two systems"" bottom line must not be challenged.
Lawmaker Starry Lee Wai-king said stopping violence, as Zhang said, was the top priority to restore social order, and it was also what the public wanted.
""I believe nobody wants to see an unstable Hong Kong as everyone needs to pay a price for the mayhem,"" Lee said.

Lam says Hong Kong taking initiative to shape groundwork for dialogue,"Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said on Thursday that she hopes a newly announced series of measures, including withdrawal of the controversial extradition amendment bill, will lay the groundwork for a social dialogue with wide engagement to help the city move on from its recent turbulence.
Besides the withdrawal, Lam has also appointed extra members to the city's police watchdog body, started a direct dialogue with all sectors across the political spectrum and pledged an independent review of the city's deep-rooted problems.
The four-part initiative of the special administrative region's government, announced on Wednesday, came after Lam's meeting with different groups to seek advice on the establishment of such a dialogue platform.
Speaking a day after announcing her plan, Lam said one pertinent piece of advice she received from that meeting was that the government needs to take the initiative to provide a basis for dialogue. ""And the withdrawal of the bill, to fully allay public concerns, is one of those important bases for a dialogue,"" she said.
A key demand of the protesters was the withdrawal of the bill, the introduction of which sparked mass protests starting in June, plunging the business hub into its biggest political crisis in decades.
Lam said she hopes the four actions she mentioned will be looked at ""in context"". ""Taken together"", she said, it is hoped they will form a basis for dialogue in the community.
The decision, she said, has received Beijing's understanding and support.
Two new members joining the Independent Police Complaints Council, a long-established watchdog for the city's police force, are Barrister Paul Lam Ting-kwok, former chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association, and Helen Yu Lai Ching-ping, a senior civil servant who has served in various public offices. The council has been commissioned to conduct an independent fact-finding probe into the turmoil.
In addition, Lam will go into the community with her governing team to directly and openly talk to the people. On Thursday, SAR Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Siu-chee visited the Eastern district on Hong Kong Island to exchange views on healthcare and environmental hygiene issues.
Community leaders, professionals and academics will be invited to independently examine and review society's deep-seated problems and make suggestions to the government on possible solutions.
Political analyst Lau Siu-kai said the government's moves could help ease tension and facilitate reconciliation. The offer could help the SAR government to win back support of some moderates who are dissatisfied with it and hope calm will return to Hong Kong, Lau said.
Lau, who is vice-president of the nation's leading Hong Kong affairs think tank - the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies - cautioned, however, that extreme radicals won't stop the violence in the short term nor attend the dialogue. But the SAR government would get more support from rational and peaceful protesters when dealing with violent acts, he added.
The government's moves also appeared to be welcomed by grassroots residents. Cheung Hoi-yee, 60, a housewife, said she hopes the dialogue will provide ""fair"" and ""balanced"" opportunities for people of all walks of life to express their opinions.
In addition to the opposition camp and protesters, residents who have incurred loss of income and stress in the recent social unrest also will have a chance to make their voice heard by officials, she said.
Taxi driver Tso Tag-ming said that only by supporting police in strictly enforcing the law to curb violence can society return to stability and peace.

Lam sets dialogue with Hong Kong residents,"Hong Kong is expected to get a new start amid the city's protracted turmoil as the first open dialogue between the city's leader and its people is scheduled for Thursday.
The session, set for 7 to 9 pm at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium in Wan Chai district, will see Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, chief executive of the special administrative region, and some principal officials engage in face-to-face talks with 150 registered residents.
The statement issued by the regional government on Thursday afternoon did not say which principal officials will accompany Lam.
According to the statement, interested participants may submit their registration forms online or at Home Affairs Enquiry Centers through Monday. Places at the dialogue will be allocated by a random computer drawing if the number of registrants exceeds the quota.
Participants will not be allowed to bring any materials that might disrupt the event, including megaphones, sound amplifiers, umbrellas, defensive equipment such as mask respirators or helmets, flags, banners, bunting, plastic, glass, metal bottles or containers, or bottled or canned drinks.
Direct dialogue with residents is one of the four initiatives Lam proposed to mend social rifts during the continued anti-government protests, which have adversely affected the city's economy and people's livelihoods.
Before announcing the arrangement, the city's leader met with about 100 district councilors on Wednesday night. It was part of the government's effort to help the city move forward after more than three months of chaos and violence.
Lam, in her closing remarks before the meeting ended, said breaking the deadlock requires strict and impartial law enforcement as well as an open dialogue. The government intends to hear about the deep-seated issues in politics, economy and people's livelihoods that triggered and fueled the protracted chaos, Lam said.
Lam stressed that ""one country, two systems"" remains the cardinal principle in maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and the rule of law is still one of the core values of the city. The government will always uphold the principle and the core value in handling social problems, she pledged.
The councilors called the two-hour meeting ""a good start"" to breaking the impasse.
After the meeting, Kwun Tong district Councilor Frankie Ngan Man-yu expressed the hope that the government would make such meetings routine.
He said the meeting laid a solid groundwork for the government's dialogue with the public.
Kowloon district Councilor Priscilla Leung Mei-fun advised the government to adopt a more proactive manner to end violence, such as introducing anti-mask legislation and establishing a designated court to handle riot cases. Leung made the comments in a speech at the meeting.

The hard core of soft terrorism in HK,"Demonstrators in Hong Kong assaulted two men from the Chinese mainland at the Hong Kong International Airport late on Tuesday night. The victims had to be taken to the hospital to receive emergency medical treatment.
For hours, the defiant protesters detained and beat up a young man who they claimed was an undercover security officer from the mainland. Initially, they prevented paramedics from taking him away to the hospital even after he lost consciousness.
The demonstrators, as videos online show, tied the other victim, a Global Times reporter, to a luggage trolley and thrashed him after finding a T-shirt in his backpack with the slogan, ""I love HK police"".
The violent incidents occurred two days after the anti-government protesters illegally occupied the arrival and departure halls of the airport, leading to cancellation of hundreds of flights.
Judging by Oxford Dictionary's description of terrorism - unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims - Tuesday's violence at the airport can be termed terrorism. So can be the indiscriminate attacks on unsuspecting Hong Kong residents.
On Aug 5, demonstrators wearing black T-shirts and ""helmets"" with their faces covered put up barricades on major streets of Hong Kong, halting traffic in the global financial and shipping hub. And they prompted people to either join the protests or stay at home. Besides, they dismantled more than 200 traffic lights, which caused dozens of accidents.
Videos available online show many people who were stopped on their way to work accusing the demonstrators of violating other people's rights and freedom in order to achieve their goals.
The demonstrators first took to the streets in June, apparently in protest against the proposed amendment to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's extradition law. But their demonstration didn't end even after the SAR government withdrew the bill.
Last month, hundreds of demonstrators attacked the Legislative Council building and vandalized the LegCo complex. They even tried to barge into the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong SAR, and defaced China's national emblem.
They threw petrol bombs at police and set fire to a police house.
Yet not all those involved in such criminal acts have been booked to face the law. Instead, many of them are roaming free in the SAR or have been released on bail by a court.
It is obvious that well-organized and well-coordinated parties are working behind the scenes to instigate the violent demonstrators. For instance, some media outlets in Hong Kong have been violating journalistic ethics, and playing politics rather than upholding facts. One such media outlet is Apple Daily, which deliberately ignores facts and, without any basis, demonizes the police force and eulogizes the demonstrators.
Some SAR judiciary members, too, have put ideology above ethics and justice, and spoken in defense of the protesters and the violence they have unleashed. Rather than demanding accountability and justice, they have joined the protesters in several demonstrations and accused the SAR government of ""politically prosecuting"" the demonstrators. They have simply turned a blind eye to the fact that the government is fighting crime according to law.
Besides, Tai Yiu-ting, an associated professor of law at the University of Hong Kong, instead of safeguarding the rule of law, has said the illegal acts of the protesters are forgivable.
And Leong Kah-kit, a barrister, recently claimed that ""violence can solve problems sometimes"", which is not too covert an encouragement to the protesters to continue the mayhem.
It is such inducements that have fueled the violence in the city. Claiming they are pursuing freedom and justice for Hong Kong people, the protesters have run riot in the city.
Stability is a prerequisite for economic progress. An economy, even a society, cannot progress if a group of people hold it to ransom by unleashing violence. And the fact that the protesters have affected the normal functioning of the SAR shows they are hell-bent on damaging its economy.
It's time the protesters realized that what they are doing, contrary to their belief, is not good for Hong Kong society or economy. It's also time the silent majority stood up and made its voice heard: that it condemns and opposes the mindless violence the protesters have unleashed.

Prominent HK women speak out against protests,"Two prominent Hong Kong women want to tell the world that the violent protests in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region these past few months have marred the stability and prosperity of the global financial hub.
Pansy Ho Chiu-king, chairwoman of the Hong Kong Federation of Women, said she wants to speak up about the truth in Hong Kong.
Ho and Annie Wu Suk-ching, a founding member of the federation, were scheduled to speak Tuesday afternoon at the 42nd session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland.
Speaking to the media on Monday, Ho said that she spent the past three months feeling puzzled and distressed. The daughter of Hong Kong and Macao-based businessman Stanley Ho, she said many Hong Kong people are afraid to venture outside due to the violence, and businesses - especially small and medium-sized enterprises - have been hit hard.
On July 1, mobs stormed Hong Kong's Legislative Council building, smashing glass doors and vandalizing the interior. On Aug 12 and 13, Hong Kong International Airport was largely shut down as protesters and mobs blocked the departure hall. In other protests, mobs threw gasoline bombs at police and damaged several subway stations.
""We hope to bring back peace and the rule of law to our society,"" Ho said.
She felt puzzled as to why the overseas media never reported on the fear caused by the riots among the ordinary people living in Hong Kong.
Ho expressed that she is not pointing fingers and it is true that there are differences in society that deserve attention.
""But we must try to look for a solution in a peaceful manner and with mutual respect instead of escalation,"" she said.
Ho praised Hong Kong police for their professionalism, saying, ""They did the best they could.""
Wu, also a businesswoman and daughter of James Tak Wu, founder of Maxim's Catering, said that the actions by mobs who damaged Hong Kong's subway system, blocked the airport and damaged public facilities, have sullied the city's global reputation. ""It's dangerous because people think that Hong Kong is no longer safe,"" she said.
In her written remarks presented to the human rights council, Ho said the foundation of Hong Kong's prosperity and stability has been shaken to the core by violent protests over the past two months.
Spreading misinformation across different platforms locally and internationally, instigating disturbances in public places, destroying public and government property, engaging in acts with the intention to cause bodily harm to the police and private citizens, vilifying the police to create public hatred and engaging in unlawful acts to provoke reactions from police are all part of a grand scheme created by the radical protesters to undermine the Hong Kong government's authority to maintain social order, according to the remarks.

Lam says HK has no room for violence,"In wake of a violent protest late Sunday in the northern New Territories, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor strongly condemned radical protesters on Monday, saying that the city will not tolerate any unlawful or violent acts.
Lam, head of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, spoke the day after a peaceful demonstration in Sha Tin against a now-suspended extradition law amendments turned into violent and bloody clashes between police and protesters in a shopping mall in the densely populated area. Twenty-eight people including over 10 police officers were injured. One officer lost part of his finger, which was later reattached.
Lam, meeting with the media after visiting injured police officers in a hospital, said radical protesters, whom she referred to as ""rioters"", recklessly attacked officers and damaged the rule of law in Hong Kong.
The rule of law is the cornerstone of Hong Kong's prosperity and should be respected by all people of Hong Kong, Lam said.
""I strongly condemn those who resorted to violence and attacked the police to express their objections. Hong Kong will not tolerate any unlawful or violent acts.""
Lam praised police professionalism and reaffirmed her support for the force. The Hong Kong leader said her administration will continue to support police in enforcing the laws and in conducting a thorough investigation.
She also called on the public to express their views in a lawful manner and support the police in safeguarding the city's rule of law.
Lam said the Hong Kong Police Force will investigate and the Department of Justice will prosecute those responsible.
Police arrested 47 people for such charges as unlawful assembly, assaulting police officers, obstructing officers and possession of offensive weapons.
Also on Monday, Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu made the ""strongest condemnation"" against protesters' violent acts, and thanked the police force for performing their duties and safeguarding the city's law and order during a difficult time.
Those violent acts could lead to serious punishment, he said. Possession of offensive weapons during a protest or assembly can lead to up to two years in jail, while deliberately attacking others - including splashing corrosive liquid or toxic powder on police officers - can result in life imprisonment, he added.
Thirty-nine pro-establishment legislators in Hong Kong strongly deplored the illegal acts of radical protesters.
In a joint statement issued on Monday, the lawmakers said the violence was ""well-organized and plotted"". They said demonstrators had been incited to charge police cordons in a provocative manner, resulting in casualties and property damage.
The lawmakers severely condemned the ""extremely irresponsible"" conduct of the protesters. ""The police force is at the forefront in safeguarding the city's rule of law. No one should smear or slander the police and dent its morale,"" the statement said.
In a statement issued on Monday, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong said the violent acts had seriously disrupted public order and threatened the city's law and order as well as public safety.
The Sha Tin clashes crossed all boundaries of acceptable conduct in a civilized society, and challenged the spirit of the rule of law and the freedom of expression, said Jonathan Choi Koon-shum, chamber of commerce chairman.

White cannot be called black in Xinjiang,"The China-skeptics in the United States are at it again. This time they are using the pretext of human rights violation to criticize China's policy of combating terrorism and separatism in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region and improving the livelihoods of the people there. But by so doing, they have exposed their ulterior motives, not least because they have no evidence to prove their allegations, and thus become the target of both ridicule and anger.
This group of people has always claimed it wants to ""help"" China further the human rights cause while, ironically, not paying any attention to the US' horrible human rights record. Which makes people wonder whether the American people elected those ""patriots"" to ""make America great again"", or just to poke their nose into other countries' internal affairs.
As we Chinese say, seeing is believing and ignorance spreads rumor. The US is thousands of kilometers away from Xinjiang, and few of those finger-in-every-pie China-skeptics have actually visited this part of the world. Yet they accept as true rumors about Xinjiang that some people have made it their job to spread.
Despite repeated invitations from the central and local governments to foreign dignitaries, envoys and journalists to visit Xinjiang, the publication of ample reports, data, photographs and videos showcasing Xinjiang's development, and the issuance of a white paper on Xinjiang's human rights condition, those China-skeptics turn a blind eye to the facts.
The authors who have penned a book on the region - Xinjiang: China's Muslim Borderland - did visit Xinjiang, but what they came up with are distorted versions of the situation, twisted history and prejudice. Thus, for those who have a political agenda to serve, facts are the first thing to ignore, twist or play with.
Some say this is a result of differences in cultures and values. Yet since the white color is a symbol of purity in one culture and of supremacism in another, bullying others to attribute just one meaning to a color is nothing but hegemony.
There is little doubt that some politicians in the US and other Western countries have an ulterior motive behind their seeming concern for Xinjiang residents. And not surprisingly, the motive is directly linked with the US' politics, ideology and global strategy. Showing a sudden interest in Xinjiang after the end of the Cold War, the US devised a so-called Xinjiang policy to boost its Central Asia strategy and new global strategy, one of whose major objectives is to weaken, contain and attempt to disintegrate China.
The US' policy to contain China is evident in the way it has hyped up the problems in Xinjiang. Some American people and organizations have openly supported the separatist ""East Turkistan Islamic Movement"" in China through political and financial help, and by disseminating its separatist ideas through publicity and diplomatic channels in the disguise of human rights and freedom. No wonder they call white black and assume the measures China has taken in Xinjiang to fight terrorism, separatism and extremism and improve public welfare are human rights violations.
The US wants to create among Belt and Road partner countries doubts about the situation in Xinjiang, which is a core region on the Silk Road Economic Belt, and thus dissuade them from participating in the Belt and Road Initiative.
Some American politicians and media will continue to proclaim the US as the judge of the world and infringe upon other countries' sovereignty. They are also expected to hype up the Tibet issue and Taiwan question, even the Hong Kong issue. In fact, their involvement in the recent protests against the amendments to Hong Kong's extradition laws is clear. But as a Uygur saying goes, camels march on as usual even when dogs bark furiously.

Hong Kong separatists to be tried in November,"Leading Hong Kong separatists Joshua Wong Chi-fung and Agnes Chow Ting will stand trial in November after appearing at the city's Eastern Magistrates' Courts on Friday afternoon.
Wong and Chow, both 22, were arrested on Friday morning over involvement in besieging the police headquarters in Wan Chai on June 21. Their trial will take place on Nov 18.
Both are facing charges of inciting others to participate in an unauthorized assembly and themselves participating in an unauthorized assembly. Wong is also facing a third charge of organizing an unauthorized assembly.
They were released on bail of HK$10,000 ($1,275) each. They will have to comply with curfew orders and are barred from traveling abroad, except for two preplanned trips.
The two are from the same political organization - Demosisto - a separatist party that Wong leads. Chow is a co-founder.
Apart from Wong and Chow, Andy Chan Ho-tin - the founder of a banned separatist party - was also arrested on Friday morning.
Chan, founder of the Hong Kong National Party, banned for its strident ""Hong Kong independence"" advocacy, was arrested late Thursday night at Hong Kong International Airport as he was about to depart for Japan.
The 29-year-old was charged with rioting and assaulting a police officer for his role during protests on July 13 in Sheung Shui, a northern district in Hong Kong bordering Shenzhen.
On Aug 1, Chan, along with 10 others, were arrested in two separate crackdowns in Fo Tan, New Territories. They are suspected of possessing offensive weapons and explosives without a license. Chan's arrest was believed to be connected to violent protests that have roiled the city since June 9. He was eventually released on bail and is due to report to police in September.
Visiting Hong Kong, Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of Beijing-based newspaper Global Times, questioned the magistrate's decision to grant the activists bail. By doing so, the judiciary sent a negative message to the public amid this violent situation, Hu said.
Hong Kong is facing unprecedented challenges. Lenient approaches to those who incite, organize and participate in illegal assemblies will hurt the city's rule of law, he added.
Meanwhile, police clarified rumors as some members of the public questioned the timing of the arrests, which happened a day before a planned but banned rally on Saturday.
The date marks the fifth anniversary of the ""831 Decision"" on Hong Kong's electoral reforms, in which the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress provided an election framework for Hong Kong to elect its chief executive by ""one person, one vote"".
During a daily news briefing on Friday afternoon, police stressed that all arrests are based on evidence. The timing of the arrests doesn't have any implications, said Tse Chun-chung, chief superintendent of Police Public Relations Branch.
""If someone breaks the law, the police will bring him or her to justice,"" Tse said.
The police are politically neutral, he added. ""We will not consider one's background or political stands when we arrest or prosecute any offender.""
Moreover, the High Court has extended a temporary ban on any action that disrupts services of the city's sole railway and subway operator until further notice.
The MTR was granted an interim injunction on Aug 23 to stop people from ""unlawfully and willfully obstructing or interfering"" with its operations.

HK assembly decries violence shown by radical protesters,"316,000 gather in rain to appeal for peace, order in SAR
The recent wave of escalated, unprecedented violence by radical protesters in Hong Kong has driven more people to condemn their unlawful behavior and demand that law and order be speedily restored in the community.
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government, the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council expressed on Sunday night their strong condemnation of the violent siege of the Liaison Office earlier in the day.
The violent acts blatantly challenged the central government's authority and have crossed the ""one country, two systems"" bottom line, and must be dealt with zero tolerance, the spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office said.
On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people from all walks of life turned up at a rally at Tamar Park in Admiralty to say no to violence and support the HKSAR's government and police. The crowd was almost twice as large as at a similar rally nearly three weeks ago.
An estimated 316,000 people defied rainy weather to express support and gratitude for the police in dealing with the protests against a now-suspended extradition bill and to appeal for peace and order.
The participants chanted slogans and waved signs and banners along with the national and HKSAR flags.
Almost none wore face masks or helmets, unlike the radical protesters who hid their identities.
The rally came in response to the growing trend of extreme violence by guerilla-style protesters - the latest example was on July 14 when hundreds of demonstrators, hurling bricks, bottles and umbrellas, clashed with police inside the New Town Plaza in Sha Tin.
Thirteen police officers were injured in that protest and taken to hospitals, and 47 protesters were arrested.
In Sunday's demonstration, a number of radical protesters splintered from the main crowd after a generally peaceful public procession on Hong Kong Island and targeted the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR in Sai Wan.
In an organized move, masked protesters escalated violence by building makeshift roadblocks from metal barricades in front of the office. Some threw eggs at the office and sprayed oily paint on the CCTV cameras. Vandals painted offensive graffiti on the outer wall of the building. The National Emblem - five stars over Tian'anmen Gate - on the building facade was defaced with an unidentified black liquid.
In response, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Leung Chun-ying strongly condemned those who tarnished the emblem. Leung said on his social media account that they must be brought to justice.
In light of the escalating violence, the police started clearing the area around 8:30 pm, from the Western District toward the east. Protesters quickly dispersed as another crowd erecting barriers to besiege the Central Police District headquarters.
At the Tamar rally on Saturday, the atmosphere was peaceful, calm and rational. It began at 5 pm as prominent politicians, academics, celebrities and representatives of ethnic minority groups were invited onto the stage to share their thoughts and wishes for Hong Kong.
Tam Yiu-chung, a member of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, thanked the crowd for braving the inclement weather to show their solidarity in safeguarding the city.
""We must not tolerate any action that undermines Hong Kong and the principle of 'one country, two systems',"" Tam said, drawing loud cheers from the crowd.
Economics professor Lui Tingming at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology received a roar of support when he urged the police to arrest and prosecute violent protesters who break the law.
""They're criminals,"" he said.
Allan Zeman, chairman of Lan Kwai Fong Holdings, said Saturday's rally could send a message to the world that Hong Kong people can end their differences and work together to resolve problems.
Wong Hei-yin, a trader, said Hong Kong people who believe in the power of cooperation built on mutual respect and tolerance should make themselves heard loud and clear in a peaceful and rational manner.
""We can't let violent protesters hijack public opinion, protesters who attack the government and undermine the rule of law while hiding their identities behind face masks and helmets,"" Wong said.
At the end of the rally, a group of youth representatives read a declaration appealing to the public never to resort to violence, to talk instead of to argue and to unite instead of to fight.

World's longest sea bridge outperforms,"The tourism and logistics sectors in Hong Kong, Macao and western Guangdong province have great market potential thanks in large part to the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, a year after the world's longest cross-sea thoroughfare opened to traffic, according to industry insiders.
The 55-kilometer bridge has served over 24 million passengers - an average 67,000 per day - since its opening on Oct 24 last year, according to the Guangdong government.
Over 70,000 vehicles from Hong Kong, Guangdong and Macao have registered to be able to use the bridge, and since its opening, over 1.5 million vehicles have crossed the bridge.
Timothy Chui Ting-pong, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, said the bridge has become a tourist spot across the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area due to its unique engineering design and the magnificent views of mountains, city and sea.
Chui said the bridge has attracted a growing number of travelers to or from Hong Kong since its opening, with travel time to traverse the structure's span under an hour.
However, he said that due to recent unrest in Hong Kong, visitors to the city from across the world have slumped.
Chui hoped Hong Kong would return to order as soon as possible, and he believed the number of travelers will pick up afterward.
He hopes tourist facilities on the artificial island at the eastern end of the bridge will open to visitors soon and further unleash the tourism potential of the structure.
As of the end of September, goods with a total value of $8.4 billion have been transported across the bridge, with products coming from 26 provinces on the Chinese mainland. Over 90 percent of the goods were from Zhuhai.
Frank Jin, founder of a Zhuhai-based customs declaration broker, assists companies in passing through customs checkpoints at the bridge before passing into Hong Kong.
With about 300 cargo vehicles traveling between Hong Kong and Zhuhai over the bridge on an average day, Jin said his companies have dealt with over 10,000 customs declarations in the past year amid steady growth in freight volume.
Jin said many large manufacturing companies in southwestern Guangdong sending their goods to Hong Kong for export have successively changed their transport routes from ports in Shenzhen to ports at the bridge, which save them some three hours on the road.
Most of them are enterprises in Zhuhai, such as electronics manufacturers like Philips and Panasonic, Jin said.
It takes time for market demand to kick in, while the operation of manufacturing companies doesn't change overnight, Jin added.
Noting that protests in Hong Kong have affected some businesses across the border, Jin said he remains positive about the future.
He believed the total volume of freight traffic on the bridge will double next year.
Kou Kun-pang, president of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport in Macao, said the bridge has provided more transport options for residents and travelers in Macao.
Kou noted that at least 40 percent of frequent ferry passengers now more often turn to the bridge for travel between Hong Kong and Macao.
As the bridge is also located beside the Hong Kong International Airport, Kou said it has attracted more people in Macao to the airport due to reduced travel time.

Online community gives SAR police 'resolute support',"An online community of young Chinese people spontaneously launched a campaign Saturday night to explain the Hong Kong issue and voice their support for Hong Kong police on various digital platforms.
The community, known as Di Bar on Chinese social media, is a group of young Chinese who live throughout the world and post about their love and support for China. They posted a message on Sina Weibo on Saturday afternoon, emphasizing their ""resolute support for the Hong Kong police to arrest rioters,"" and that their mission is ""conveying the voice of Chinese youth in a rational way"".
Their campaign, they said, is driven by ""patriotism, rationality, civilization and truth-seeking"" and they put forward five demands countering ""the unreasonable demands"" from Hong Kong protesters.
The community called for ""stopping the violence, restoring order, punishing the rioters, fighting against lawbreaking acts and reporting fair news"".
It also set up social media groups for people to communicate and share contents that can be posted on overseas social media, including Chinese and English comments, emojis, posters, and images of how foreign police deal with radicals.
Their campaign was soon welcomed by a large number of young netizens from different online communities, including fans of pop idols who now look at China as their biggest idol.
Starting at 7 pm Saturday, netizens first crowded into Instagram and showed support to many public figures who have openly stood with Hong Kong police. Many of the celebrities had been much criticized by Hong Kong separatists, but their recent posts now are flooded with supportive comments accompanied by Chinese flags.
Each post on the Hong Kong Police's Facebook page has received thousands of supporting comments and likes from netizens. Apple Daily, a Hong Kong-based newspaper, shut down its livestreaming of Hong Kong radical protesters on its Facebook page after tens of thousands of instant comments poured in to strongly condemn the protest.
""We're sticking to the one China principle, support Hong Kong police and safeguard China's sovereignty. We do not allow external forces to ever touch China's land,"" a Facebook user named Jie Tian wrote.
Laurence Zhang, a 23-year-old mainland graduate of Hong Kong Baptist University, said he would be pleased if this campaign would promote ""sincere communication"" between young people in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland.
Zhang joined the Facebook group when he saw Di Bar's post. Since he currently lives in Hong Kong and has access to more firsthand information, Zhang said he wanted to post more fake news and false statements so that police supporters would know what and how to respond.
""I've seen mostly more rebuttals than sincere talk after the influence of fake news and Western ideology. If this action can help us promote better communication with Hong Kong young people I will be very happy,"" Zhang said.
Zhang is one of the Chinese youths who are the most active Chinese-speaking internet users.
A statement released by Di Bar on Thursday said that the younger generation stepping up to let their voices be heard reflects their confidence and faith in their country.
Junius Ho, a Hong Kong lawyer and politician, left supporting message to the campaign on his Weibo account, saying they are using their ""patriotic sentiments, rational attitudes and spirit of truth seeking to sweep away the dark clouds in the sky of public opinion and restore peace and freshness to the society.""
The Communist Youth League of China also showed its support on Weibo Saturday, saying, ""Tonight belongs to the netizens of Di Bar"".

Lawlessness undermining rule of law in Hong Kong,"The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has explained many times the proposed amendments to Hong Kong's fugitive law are meant to better protect Hong Kong society by plugging the loopholes in the existing laws in order to enhance the rule of law.
Rather than pushing through a bill against the wishes of Hong Kong society as some have tried to portray, the government has made changes to the proposed bill more than once in response to concerns expressed in the community.
As a result, most of the members of Legislative Council of the special administrative region, who are accountable to their voters, now support the amendments.
Nor is it a hasty or unnecessary move. Indeed the need for an extradition agreement with the mainland was acknowledged by government officials and legal experts ahead of Hong Kong's return to China in 1997.
Yet there are still some who have jumped on the issue, as a means to create a disturbance and tarnish the image of the government.
After clashes between rioters and police early Monday morning, violent protests on Wednesday caused LegCo to postpone the scheduled full council meeting for resumption of the legislative process for the amendment bill, prompting calls for calm and rational discussions.
Although the legislation is in accordance with the Basic Law, satisfies all the requirements of relevant international conventions and suits Hong Kong's status as an international city with a mature legal system, the opposition camp and its foreign masters seem willing to oppose it for their own purposes at the expense of the city's rule of law, public safety and justice.
Meant only to strengthen Hong Kong's judicial independence, the amendments will not contravene the principle of ""one country, two systems"".
It is a common practice among independent jurisdictions to provide mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, including but not limited to the surrender of criminal fugitives.
If one jurisdiction has enjoyed such assistance from another but then refuses to reciprocate in kind, the latter has reason to stop offering such assistance.
While inciting and encouraging unlawful behavior in the ongoing anti-fugitive law amendment bill campaign, the opposition camp has never mentioned the fact that, despite the lack of an official agreement on mutual legal assistance, judicial departments on the mainland have handed over many criminal suspects wanted in Hong Kong on serious charges over the years. Handing over of these fugitives has certainly helped Hong Kong curb cross-boundary crimes and maintain its reputation as one of the safest cities in the world.
It is lawlessness that will hurt Hong Kong, not the proposed amendments to its fugitive law."
HK protesters urged to shun acts of violence,"Traffic paralyzed as thousands march, chanting anti-government slogans
The heart of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region descended into chaos with business partially suspended and traffic entirely paralyzed on Sunday afternoon after masked protesters launched an unauthorized assembly.
Thousands gathered in the assembly on Hong Kong Island on Sunday, targeting several locations, including Hong Kong's Golden Bauhinia Square flag-raising venue in Wan Chai, the day after an illegal rally turned violent in the city's western part of New Territories Yuen Long.
The protesters, wearing face masks, defaced property, left graffiti and dismantled metal sidewalk railings along their way in Sai Ying Pun, Sheung Wan, Central and Causeway Bay, the heart of Hong Kong Island, despite continuous police warnings.
China Daily reporters taking photos at the scene were warned repeatedly and followed by several masked protesters. One used an umbrella to try to stop reporters from taking pictures.
At about 3:40 pm, thousands of people gathered at Chater Garden, heart of Hong Kong's financial and administrative district, and occupied a major road in a procession toward Wan Chai. Traffic was paralyzed.
Another group of protesters headed toward Sheung Wan. Some shouted that their target was the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in Sai Wan. A few headed to Sogo, a major shopping mall in Causeway Bay.
The police stressed that anyone participating in the unauthorized procession was breaking the law and no violence would be tolerated during the event.
Senior Superintendent of Police Public Relations Branch Yu Hoikwan said in a news briefing at Police Headquarters that the public was urged to take part in the Chater Garden assembly in a peaceful and lawful manner.
Violent clashes against police that endangered public safety, like those in Yuen Long on Saturday, would not be tolerated, Yu said.
A similar procession was held on Saturday night in Yuen Long. That illegal march, which was banned by the police out of safety concerns, ended with a bloody and violent clash between some radical protesters and police officers.
In a statement on Sunday, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government strongly condemned protesters for disturbing the peace and deliberately breaking the law, saying the police would take ""serious follow-up actions"".
The police also condemned deliberate attacks by violent protesters in a statement on Sunday, stressing they would investigate all illegal and violent acts.
Joining the condemnation were 39 Hong Kong lawmakers of the pro-establishment camp. In a joint statement on Sunday, they expressed their ""strong discontent"" with rioters and repeated that they opposed all violent and illegal acts.
Also on Sunday, Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po wrote in his weekly blog that recent violent protests have worried all who are concerned about Hong Kong.
He called on the public to firmly reject violence. ""Don't let hate and violence take root in and spread over the society.""
During the nearly seven hours of Yuen Long protest conflicts on Saturday, some radical protesters violently charged police cordons, damaged a police vehicle and blocked roads. They hurled bricks, threw glass bottles containing suspected-corrosive fluids and smoke-producing materials at police trying to disperse them.
Twenty-four people were injured during the incident, including at least four police officers. At least thirteen men were arrested on charges including unlawful assembly, possession of an offensive weapon, assaulting a police officer and assault.
On Sunday morning, piles of trash could be seen everywhere near Nam Pin Wai village in Yuen Long. Bricks, bottles, broken umbrellas, damaged fences and graffiti littered the scene of the previous day's rally.
Also on Sunday, the central government's foreign affairs office in the HKSAR sternly denounced a United States congressman for ""telling bare-faced lies"" and ""slinging mud against conscience"".
The Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region responded after US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel issued a statement on Friday criticizing the Hong Kong police's handling of recent anti-extradition bill protests.
By around 8 pm on Sunday, the protesters were dispersed from the Sai Ying Pun area. Train service for Sai Ying Pun, HKU and Kennedy Town stations was temporarily suspended around the same time. Shortly after that, police were seen detaining some protesters.
At around 8:30 pm, the police issued a statement condemning the protesters for escalating violence.

"Beijing backs Lam, government of HKSAR","The Foreign Ministry reiterated on Monday the central government's firm support for Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and her administration in delivering governance in accordance with the laws.
During a regular daily news conference in Beijing, ministry spokesman Lu Kang stressed that the central government extends its full support to the chief executive and appreciates the performance of Lam and the SAR government.
Lu said pushing Hong Kong into chaos is undoubtedly against mainstream public opinion in Hong Kong.
He reiterated that the central government strongly condemns any violence during protests and firmly supports the Hong Kong police in taking actions in accordance with the laws to safeguard the rule of law and public security in the SAR.
The central government also is resolutely against any foreign interference in China's internal affairs through making biased and irresponsible comments on the HKSAR's extradition law amendments.
After a mass protest in Hong Kong against proposed extradition changes, the Hong Kong government decided to suspend the amendment. In a written statement, Lam apologized to the public for causing disappointment and grief, and she pledged to adopt a sincere and humble attitude to accept criticism and make improvements in serving the public.
Social heavyweights also expressed their backing of Lam and expectations that Hong Kong society will reunite in the future.
President of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong Dennis Ng Wang-pun said the organization understands Lam's decision. He said he hoped that with the suspension, the city's people can put aside political disputes and focus on addressing the city's economic and livelihood problems.
Members of the Executive Council - the top policy advisory body to the chief executive in Hong Kong - expressed similar hopes.
Convener of the Executive Council and businessman Bernard Charnwut Chan said he thinks the chief executive has a humble attitude toward improving future governance.
Joseph Yam Chi-kwong, an Executive Council member and prominent local economist, said he hoped the disputes would fade away so the city could return to normal and shift its focus to development issues.
Also on Monday, the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the HKSAR lodged solemn representations over what it said were some foreign media's biased coverage of the extradition law amendments in Hong Kong.
The office urged relevant media to respect basic facts of the SAR government's decision to suspend the bill and police moves to safeguard Hong Kong's rule of law and public security in accordance with the law.

Hyping HK violence won't win Tsai votes,"With her ruling Democratic Progressive Party suffering heavy losses in the local elections in November last year, Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen's position has become untenable. She was even challenged by Lai Ching-te in the race to choose the DPP candidate for the island's leadership election.
To retain her leadership position, Tsai is trying to cover her governance failures by shifting the focus to other issues. And the violence unleashed by demonstrators in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region against the now-dead extradition bill suits her purpose, as she probably believes it can be used as a weapon against the Chinese mainland to garner popular support on the island.
Since the DPP came to power in 2016, cross-Straits relations have changed from peaceful development to confrontation, significantly damaging the livelihoods of Taiwan residents. Voters expressed their anger with the Tsai administration by rejecting the DPP candidates in the local elections in November, which dealt a serious blow to Tsai.
First, the pro-independence Tsai, unable to boost the island's economic growth and address Taiwan residents' concerns, has resorted to political tricks to cover her failures.
Tsai managed to defeat Lai in the race for the DPP's candidacy for the island's election by hyping up the protests in Hong Kong using fake news to mislead her party members. Her moves suggest she intends to continue using the Hong Kong protests to win over competitors from rival parties in order to win a second term.
Second, Tsai is interfering in the SAR's affairs to help the United States win brownie points in its trade conflict with the mainland and get the US' support in return to be re-elected. By voicing support for the rioters in Hong Kong, Tsai intends to prove they share the same ideology as the US and show the island's strategic value for Washington against Beijing. The DPP even claims to have provided the Hong Kong demonstrators with ""humanitarian aid"".
Considering the mainland's warning to separatists on the island, the Tsai administration is eager to seek a patron to realize its political goals, and it has found one in the US. More important, she believes that by supporting the violent Hong Kong demonstrators, she can help the DPP win the election defeating its biggest rival Kuomintang, which favors promoting cross-Straits economic exchanges based on the 1992 Consensus that there is only one China, and both sides of the Straits belong to China, that Tsai refuses to recognize.
By twisting the facts about the SAR to its benefit, the Tsai administration is trying to alienate its political rival from the mainland, further squeezing the space for Kuomintang to promote cross-Straits policies for the benefit of Taiwan residents.
Third, by supporting the Hong Kong demonstrators, Tsai is attempting to malign ""one country, two systems"" and seek ""Taiwan independence"".
After President Xi Jinping proposed that political parties and compatriots on both sides of the Straits uphold the 1992 Consensus, oppose ""Taiwan independence"", and conduct democratic consultation on the ""one country, two systems"" principle for peaceful reunification in a speech on Jan 2 to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan, Tsai became so nervous that she started looking for excuses to tarnish the ""one country, two systems"" principle. And she found in the Hong Kong protests one such excuse.
As part of her game plan, the island's administration refused to sign an extradition bill with the Hong Kong SAR government to extradite a Hong Kong fugitive who killed his pregnant girlfriend in Taiwan to stand trial in the SAR.
The Tsai administration has also been spreading lies - that the protests in Hong Kong signify the failure of the ""one country, two systems"". By lending support to the Hong Kong rioters, Tsai is trying to bring Taiwan and Hong Kong separatists together to gain political mileage and prevent national reunification.
Tsai has been fanning the flames of violence in Hong Kong and is likely to continue playing her dirty game. But compatriots on the island will not be fooled by her trickery for long, especially if their livelihoods are at stake. And the DPP will never succeed in severing cross-Straits relations.

"Hong Kong official: Top priority is to stop violence, end chaos","Senior government officials pleaded on Sunday for concerted efforts to stop violence and make Hong Kong, the ""Pearl of the Orient,"" shine again after its image has been sullied by nearly three months of violent protests.
Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said in his blog that the government is sincere in working with the public to seek solutions to deep-seated problems through rational dialogues. But he emphasized that such efforts were not a compromise to violence and the top priority for the society is to stop violence and end the chaos.
Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said the lasting and escalating violence has dealt a heavy blow to the city's economy, with tourism, retail and hotel sectors bearing the brunt. Constructive dialogues are what the city needs in order to move forward, he said.
Secretary for Labour and Welfare Law Chi-kwong expressed hope in his blog that people of different political backgrounds would set aside differences and mend the rift that has been widened by the monthslong unrest.
The officials' calls were in line with the four initiatives announced on Wednesday by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, which include a formal withdrawal of the extradition bill and engaging in direct talks with people, irrespective of their political stance and social status.
Despite the government's earnest calls, violence erupted again as gangs of black-clad rioters provoked violent clashes with the city's police force and vandalized metro stations, forcing the rail operator to shut down part of its services.
The past weekend was the 14th in which Hong Kong endured violence and chaos.
On Sunday, the city's business center of Central on Hong Kong Island became a battlefield with masked rioters starting fires at multiple locations, making traffic flow impossible in the area.
The mobs also wrecked the Central metro station, smashing windows, spraying offensive graffiti on its exterior and blocking its exits with piles of trash. Metro service at Central Station was forced to shut down.
The violence came after masked protesters marched from a permitted rally at the Charter Garden in Central to the US consulate.
On Saturday, crowds of radicals gathered in Tung Chung Station, smashing facilities inside, while some assaulted police officers inside a Sha Tin mall and others started fires, attacked the police station and blocked roads in Mong Kok.
The MTR Corp, operator of Hong Kong's railway system, issued an open letter on Sunday, saying the MTR was facing its most serious challenge in its 40 years of operation. It urged people from all walks of life to cherish and protect the railway network, since it has been part of the collective memory of Hong Kong people for decades.

HK's Lam cautions of 'economic tsunami',"Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor announced on Friday that the government will step up a series of measures to support society as the city braces for a possible ""economic tsunami"".
To speed up the move, the Executive Council - the de facto cabinet of Hong Kong's chief executive, originally scheduled to be resumed on Aug 27 - will resume instead on Tuesday, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region announced.
The city is feeling the pinch from more than two months of anti-extradition bill protests along with the escalating China-United States trade dispute, and the resulting possible economic crisis could be a situation worse than the 2003 SARS epidemic or the 2008 global financial meltdown.
A whole package of stimulus measures will be introduced to support employment and lend a helping hand to the city's affected companies in an upcoming policy-related address in October, Lam said.
""Hong Kong cannot be messed up. This is the consensus I have reached with 33 representatives from the business community at the meeting,"" she said.
Flanked by nine ministers and business leaders at a news conference after concluding a meeting with the representatives on Friday, Lam said the government's overarching goal is to put an end to violent clashes, restore social order and fearlessly safeguard the city's rule of law.
Tourism is among the first sectors to suffer. Hong Kong's major civil aviation labor unions voiced strong objection to mass sit-ins at Hong Kong International Airport as it turns the city's transport hub into a political chip against the government.
The Staff & Workers Union of Hong Kong Civil Airlines issued a statement as hundreds of protesters started the sit-in against the now-suspended extradition bill on Friday afternoon.
The union was speaking on behalf of seven affiliated unions of different occupations, including ground staff, catering, logistics and cargo services.
""The HKIA is the economic lifeline of the city. Occupying the airport will only damage the city's economy and the livelihood of airport staff, as it has been recently been proved that these protests will end up in violent clashes,"" according to the statement.
The union appealed to fellow members and Hong Kong citizens not to take part in the rally or any campaign intended to undermine the airport's operations for political purposes.
On July 26, thousands of blackclad protesters occupied the airport's arrival hall to stage a similar sit-in protest, which disrupted air travel.
The sit-in protest in the airport arrival hall is scheduled to continue over the weekend. The city's airport authority said it strengthened its safety checks and only departing passengers with valid travel documents will be allowed to enter the terminal.
Over the weekend, planned anti-government marches in four districts of Hong Kong have been prohibited by the police for security reasons, according to police spokespersons at a news conference.
Ng Lok-chun, senior superintendent of the Hong Kong Island Regional Headquarters, the local police force, said the decision was made upon consideration of public safety and order, and protection of other people's rights and freedoms.
A series of recent protests escalated into violent clashes with physical attacks, blocking of streets, damaging of public utilities and the setting of fires, and many participants, journalists and police officers were injured.
On Friday, representatives of different sectors in Hong Kong appealed to the public to reject violence and support the Hong Kong police in safeguarding the rule of law.
A cross-sector alliance set up against the recent violent protests - Safeguard Hong Kong - hoped that Hong Kong people will join a scheduled citywide pro-police campaign on Saturday. Activities include sending ""thank you notes"" to the police and expressing gratitude to the force online.

Intensifying violence in Hong Kong calls for tougher line to restore order,"Radical protesters in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region went on the rampage again on the weekend, blocking thoroughfares, vandalizing shops and buildings, setting fire to subway stations, beating up passers-by, planting nails on roads, and attacking police officers with petrol bombs, bricks and other objects.
Such acts, which serve no other purpose than to vent the anger of some young people at grievances real and imagined and give them a frission of daredeviled lawbreaking, have seemingly become weekend amusement for some in Hong Kong.
As has now become the norm, businesses affiliated with the mainland are considered fair game for vandalism, presumably under the mistaken belief that is less harmful to the rioters' livelihoods and will have less public blowback. This time Xinhua News Agency's Asia-Pacific Regional Bureau office building in Wan Chai was targeted by the rioters, who destroyed the building's security facilities, spray-painted insulting words on the walls and smashed the front gate and some of its windows before throwing firebombs and paint bombs into the lobby.
Saturday's assault on the Xinhua News Agency offices and the previous verbal and physical attacks on journalists and reporting crews from other news outlets such as TVB and Taikungpao are strategically consistent. The radical protesters have been trying hard to convince the world they are championing a noble cause in a peaceful manner rather than engaging in wanton violence. To this end, they court the indulgence extended to them by friendly local and Western media outlets, while seeking to silence those trying to put the protests in the spotlight of truth-revealing them to be nothing more than adolescent hormones pumped up and primed by those willing to exploit them for their own purposes.
Any media outlets or individual journalists who adhere to professionalism and tell the world the truth about Hong Kong's so-called uprising, who refuse to glorify anarchism or the demonizing of the Hong Kong police have automatically become a thorn in the flesh of the radicals and a target for their vigilante retribution.
The black-clad rioters' obsession with umbrellas and masks is an extension of their strategy to hide their shocking criminal acts and the truth about their violent campaign. But they are naive to think that they can fool the world and win the support they want with such clumsy tactics. They are doomed to fail simply because their violence will encounter the full weight of the law.
The central authorities indicated on Friday that they intend to establish and strengthen the legal system and enforcement mechanism in the SAR to safeguard social order and national security. Those Hong Kong residents whose lives have been disrupted by the intensifying violence of intimidation - instigated and organized by those hoping to use Hong Kong as a means to destabilize the nation - will be glad when life returns to normal."
HK must not be ruled by anarchy,"The violence in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region intensified over the weekend, with more extensive vandalism and arson and the discovery of another homemade bomb. The worsening situation may call for more stringent measures to restore law and order in the SAR.
What started on Sunday, before all hell broke loose, was a so-called peaceful but illegal demonstration in Kowloon. Given what had happened following past rallies, the gathering had rightly been denied approval by the police. And confirming their fears, no sooner had the main body of demonstrators left than radical demonstrators started blocking roads and setting fire in multiple places along Nathan Road, the main traffic artery in Kowloon. Black smoke filled the air in many parts of the peninsula. The targets of the vandals-arsonists, other than police stations, government departments and public facilities such as MTR stations and traffic lights, were expanded to include almost all mainland-related businesses - banks, restaurants, bookstores and telecom equipment stores - and local ones that have spoken out against them.
Amidst the chaos, one thing was very clear - the rioters cared nothing about public safety. That, on the other hand, is the SAR government's top concern. As the police had warned, fires set in ground-floor shops spread upward, endangering the lives of residents living on the upper floors. Furthermore, subsequent to the previous discovery of a roadside improvised explosive device, another one was found on Sunday. The use of IEDs as well as extensive and indiscriminate arson show this illegal campaign is adopting terror tactics.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor stated when announcing the anti-mask law that more measures would be introduced if the situation continued to worsen. Now with violence intensifying and the local and foreign forces behind the turmoil showing no signs of letting things calm down, more stringent measures are obviously called for. One possible way to cripple the illegal activities may be to impose stricter controls on social media. We all know the radical protesters are using social media to communicate and organize their activities. Depriving them of these means of effective communication is an option to consider.
At the same time, Western politicians and media should act responsibly and stop supporting the illegal and violent activities. Their interference in Hong Kong's affairs is a denial of the democracy and human rights that they so smugly claim to be upholding.
But ultimately the most effective way to end the violence is for Hong Kong residents to continue to stand firmly behind the SAR government and the police, so that the masterminds behind the scene will come to understand what they have stirred up in the SAR will get them nowhere and instead end up hurting their own interests."
China slams US attempt to conceal HK interference,"The Foreign Ministry on Friday rejected the United States' labeling of China as ""a thuggish regime"", saying that Washington has confused right with wrong in an attempt to conceal its interference in China's domestic affairs.
Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement it was astonishing to see the US State Department spokeswoman claim that it was the job of US diplomats to meddle in the domestic affairs of other countries. ""Can the world be at peace given the way the US does things?"" Hua asked.
Hua's comments came as US State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus on Thursday called China a ""thuggish regime"" for disclosing the photographs and personal details of a US diplomat who met with major leaders of the ""Hong Kong independence"" activists.
The US State Department spokeswoman should repent of her own words and behavior instead of using media reports to hit out at the government of another country, Hua said. She added that US interference in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's affairs has caused resolute opposition and strong indignation among the Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots.
She urged the US to observe international laws and basic norms governing international relations and stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and interfering in China's domestic affairs.
Also on Friday, the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in HKSAR denounced Ortagus' claims as a blatant slander against China, saying the remarks once again exposed US ""gangster logic"" and ""hegemonic thinking"".
The US State Department spokesperson seems to take it for granted that it is the job of US diplomats to collude with local anti-government and even separatist forces everywhere around the world, the office said in a statement on its website.
""Such acts arbitrarily undermine other countries' sovereignty and security despite their opposition and indignation, and show little regard for international law and basic norms governing international relations.""
Tam Yiu-chung, a member of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said amid the tense atmosphere of a series of violent protests in Hong Kong, it's hard for people not to question the hidden agenda of the US behind the meeting with local separatists.
Tam said the US is trying to shift the focus of attention and rationalize their immoral acts. ""Such behavior should be seriously condemned, ""he said.

Experts decry judgment on flag defilement,"Community service sentence ignores seriousness of man's crime, they say
The recent Hong Kong court's judgment imposed on a man who desecrated the Chinese national flag during an anti-government protest has failed to recognize the seriousness of the case, as the flag is a symbol of national sovereignty, dignity and the ""one country, two systems"" principle, legal experts said on Thursday.
They thought the man's sentence, a mere 200 hours of community service, would have no deterrent effect on society. The case was the city's first - one of several involving national flag desecration during recent protests - to receive a judgment.
The remarks came after the Sha Tin Magistrates' Courts in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on Tuesday sentenced 21-year-old technician Law Manchung to 200 hours of community service for one count of desecrating the national flag.
Law had pleaded guilty to trampling on a national flag and throwing it into a garbage bin, which he then tossed into a river in Sha Tin, New Territories, on Sept 22.
According to the National Flag and National Emblem Ordinance, a person who desecrates the national flag can face up to three years in prison.
Willy Fu Kin-chi, a law professor and member of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, stressed that the nature of the defendant's behavior was very serious, as he ""deliberately challenged the national sovereignty"", and undermined the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
The sentence of community service was ""too lenient"", Fu remarked. He said only a prison sentence can deter people from committing similar crimes.
Lawrence Ma Yan-kwok, a barrister and chairman of the Hong Kong Legal Exchange Foundation, agreed that the sentence was too light compared to previous cases in the SAR.
He referred to a case in August when a man was sentenced to four weeks in jail for spray-painting ""China will win"" on the gate of the United States Consulate General in Hong Kong to protest US interference in Hong Kong's internal affairs.
Ma said the court neglected the fact that a national flag is the symbol of national dignity.
He urged the Department of Justice to file an appeal against the judgment.
Ronny Tong Ka-wah, a barrister and member of the Executive Council, the chief executive's top political advisory body, pointed out that under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, desecrating the nation's symbol should not be punished more leniently than defacing the gate of a foreign consulate.
Previous judgments over these crimes varied largely from each other, Tong said, citing a case in 2013, where activist Koo Sze-yiu was sentenced to nine months in jail for burning a national flag.
He said he ""absolutely agrees"" that the court must establish clear sentencing guidelines for flag desecration.
In handing down the verdict, Magistrate Lee Chi-ho admitted the seriousness of Law's behavior, but said it was no more serious than burning a national flag.
After the court judgment on Tuesday, Hong Kong's former chief executive Leung Chun-ying said the lenient sentence will trigger public outrage in the whole country and urged the Department of Justice to lodge an appeal.

Legislation suspension wins strong support,"The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's decision to suspend legislation on proposed amendments to the city's extradition laws received wide support and understanding from various sectors, as it is believed this move will help allay social disputes and ensure the city's long-term stability and prosperity.
On Saturday, the region's Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor announced the decision to restore calm and order in society after concerns, doubts and even conflicts were seen over the amendments.
The suspension would allow the government to further communication with all sectors of society, better explain the proposed legislation and listen to different views on the matter, Lam said.
The decision received support from central government bodies including the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, the Foreign Ministry and the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR.
In separate statements issued after the announcement, spokespersons stressed that the central government supports, respects and understands the SAR government's decision.
Tam Yiu-chung, an HKSAR member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said suspending the extradition law legislation is a positive move by the government in response to public sentiment calling for more time for discussion.
By doing so, Lam has shown sincerity, he said. And he hopes the public will understand and support the government's decision.
Barrister Ronny Tong Ka-wah, who is also a member of the HKSAR's Executive Council, a top policy advisory body to the SAR's chief executive, said the government's decision to suspend the extradition law revision at this point is appropriate.
The suspension could avoid more violence that would further divide the city and in the meantime, give more time for public discussion of the legislation. These consensus-building efforts may boost the chances of having the legislation passed, he said.
In response to public processions regarding the legislation on the past two Sundays, an unnamed spokesperson with the SAR government said in a statement late on Sunday that Lam clearly heard the views that were expressed in a peaceful and rational manner.
The government reiterated that there was no time frame set for restarting the legislation, the statement said.
The chief executive admitted that deficiencies in the government's work led to substantial controversies and disputes in society, causing disappointment and grief among the people, and Lam apologized to the people of Hong Kong for this, the statement added.
Lam vowed to be humble and sincere in accepting public criticism and to make improvements in serving the public of Hong Kong, it said.
The decision to suspend also received backing from Jonathan Choi Koon-shum, chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, one of Hong Kong's most influential business associations.
In a statement issued on Saturday, Choi said the suspension would help alleviate the tense atmosphere in society and restart rational discussion. He pointed out that amid the complicated and ever-changing international situation, different sectors should join hands in maintaining society's harmony and stability while focusing on economic development and improving people's livelihoods.
The Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong - the city's largest political party representing the business sector - also expressed support and understanding for the SAR government's decision. The alliance said it hopes the government will thoroughly explain the bill to different sectors and listen to their opinions. It also urged communities not to use violent or radical means to express views.
The proposed amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance were scheduled to be discussed at a full Legislative Council meeting for a second reading on Wednesday.
The meeting had to be canceled after a protest against the amendments brought the city's main administrative and business areas to a standstill. If passed, the amendments will enable the HKSAR to surrender fugitive offenders on a case-by-case basis to jurisdictions that currently have no long-term agreements with Hong Kong, including the Chinese mainland, Macao and Taiwan.

Calling basketball fans 'kneelers' goes too far,"WITH THE US NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION embroiled in controversy over its support for the protests in Hong Kong, those who did attend the NBA's activities in Shanghai and Shenzhen have been given the nickname ""kneelers"" on social media. China Daily writer Zhang Zhouxiang comments:
When The Wall Street Journal published a photo of two Chinese fans at one of the events on its cover, some domestic micro bloggers posted a photo of the page and called for people to find ""the two traitors"".
This is too extreme. The two basketball fans have done nothing but watched a basketball game; How have they become ""traitors""?
Houston Rockets' general manager Daryl Morey is wrong for tweeting his support of those calling for an independent Hong Kong. NBA head Adam Silver is wrong because he mistook Morey's tweet in praise of illegal and subversive actions as being ""freedom of expression"". US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is wrong because he urged the NBA to ""stand up to China"", trying to make the sporting body a tool for the US administration's narrow political purposes.
Chinese companies and institutions meanwhile are right to suspend cooperation with the NBA because of the above. Nonetheless, that does not negate the right of Chinese basketball fans to watch NBA matches and join NBA activities as long as the activities and contests are simply basketball matches.
Some call for boycotting the NBA, saying it has made a lot of money from Chinese basketball fans. They might have their reasons, but those who choose to watch NBA basketball have their reasons, too. The NBA as a commercial institution is serving them as customers, and people are not ""funding the NBA"" when they buy tickets for a game.
The NBA is composed of hundreds of basketball players, none of whom has said anything improper about Hong Kong or other domestic affairs of China. James Harden, a basketball star from Houston Rockets, tweeted an apology to the Chinese people after Morey's trouble-making tweet.
Is it really necessary and fair to boycott all these stars only because of the wrongdoings and wrongmindedness of Morey and Silver? The stars have done nothing wrong and they should not pay for the wrongs of their colleague or boss.
Maybe some people will boycott NBA. They can do so, but they need to know that other people have the right to make a different choice.

Canada's remarks slammed,"The Chinese Foreign Ministry's Commissioner's Office in Hong Kong on Thursday urged the Canadian government and politicians to ""stop trying anxiously to highlight their presence by interfering in Hong Kong affairs"".
Speaking to an audience in Montreal on Wednesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau repeated his call for restraint and respect for human rights as protests sweep Hong Kong, Reuters reported.
In response, the Commissioner's Office urged Canada and the Canadian politicians to ""know their place, realize their mistakes and abide by international law and norms that govern international relations"".
The remarks by Canadian politicians ""have confounded violent crime with peaceful rallies, ignored the Hong Kong police's efforts to punish violence according to law,"" an unnamed spokesperson with the office said.
""The remarks have failed to distinguish between right and wrong, and run counter to the shared aspirations of Hong Kong citizens to stop violence, end the chaos and restore order. They are essentially aimed to endorse and embolden the violent offenders,"" the spokesperson added.
Canada's ties with China suffered great strain after the country detained Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, in December.

Secessionists of a feather flock together,"The chaos in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has provided Tsai Ing-wen, the separatist leader of Taiwan, and her Democratic Progressive Party with an excuse to slander the ""one country, two systems"", which the Chinese mainland practices in order to realize complete national reunification.
The massive defeat Tsai and the DPP suffered in last year's local election shows what lies in store for them in the island's leadership election next year. Which explains her desperation to use the unrest in Hong Kong as a tool to garner voters' support on the island to win next year's polls. No wonder she and her party don't want the Hong Kong demonstrations to end.
Tsai has chosen to be silent on the violence unleashed by the demonstrators in Hong Kong and instead has vowed to provide humanitarian aid for the rioters, hinting that they have been ""unfairly"" treated.
By openly supporting the Hong Kong demonstrators, Tsai is adding fuel to the fire. She has also joined the United States, the island's most avid supporter, in fanning passions in the SAR.
Playing the role of a US acolyte, the Tsai administration is trying to curry favor with the White House with the aim of strengthening its hand on the island and arrest its downward political slide.
The fact that the unrest in Hong Kong has enough surplus value for Tsai to exploit is evident in Joshua Wong, a Hong Kong secessionist detained on Saturday for inciting violence and illegal assembly, flying to Taiwan on Tuesday for a two-day meeting with his ""like-minded hosts"".
Not surprisingly, the invitation was extended by a foundation funded by DPP officials shortly after he was released on bail on the very day he was arrested.
More than 10 Hong Kong separatists have been welcomed by Taiwan. But according to reports, they have complained about the poor living conditions there, and regretted their decision to visit Taiwan after seeing many of the protesters being released on bail so soon, and afraid of being stigmatized for their engagement with Taiwan.
Neither the Taiwan nor the Hong Kong separatists take the other seriously as each side has an axe to grind. They only treat each other as an expedient card to play to make short-term gains. But both conceal their shared belief that Beijing is determined to defend the core national interests, and nothing can stop it from doing so."
Sage counsel for HK's future well-being,"Speaking publicly for the first time about the turmoil in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, President Xi Jinping said that ending the violence and chaos and restoring order are the most important tasks for the SAR government at present.
His remarks came after he was updated on the situation in the SAR by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, when they met on the sidelines of the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai on Monday.
Countering rumors that the central authorities have lost confidence in her government's ability to quell the unrest, he said they had a ""high degree of trust"" in her administration being able to stabilize the situation in the SAR. Urging her to be firm, he said that stopping the violence and punishing the perpetrators in accordance with the law is the way to safeguard the well-being of ordinary people in Hong Kong; the majority who just want to get on with their lives.
What the SAR is facing is an unprecedented challenge not only to its government, but also to the rule of law, its social and economic stability, as well as the implementation of the ""one country, two systems"" framework.
Xi's remarks were a signal, loud and clear, to the forces behind the current crisis that despite their persistence their destabilization campaign is doomed to fail.
His remarks served as a great morale booster for ordinary residents in the city, whose daily lives have been thrown into disarray and whose livelihoods damaged by the selfish attention seeking of some.
They were also a slap in the face for local and foreign forces that have been pandering to the disruptive and destructive exhibitionism of the rioters; hoping to discredit the SAR government and force Beijing into taking a hard line response that would see it being ostracized by foreign investors and the international community.
His words showed their ploy has failed.
To help the SAR find a way out of the current crisis, he indicated the way forward for the city, as well as his expectations of the SAR government - stop the storm of unrest, encourage dialogue among all sectors of society, and improve people's livelihoods.
And the SAR government is making headway in these directions. The introduction of the anti-mask law has effectively reduced the size of protests, a community dialogue has been held and more are being planned, and bold measures to tackle deep-seated problems, especially land and housing shortages, were announced in Lam's recent policy address.
Now, those Hong Kong residents who have the city's best interests at heart must render their full support to these efforts so they can have the desired effects."
Twitter manipulating conversation on Hong Kong,"When Daryl Morey tweeted in support of the violent protests that have raged in Hong Kong for months, he probably did not foresee a huge backlash from China.
After many Chinese NBA fans expressed their anger, the general manager of Houston Rockets on Oct 7 explained his action by saying that, ""I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.""
Morey may not just be making excuses.
Living in a filter bubble created by Twitter's algorithms, users who do not realize there is an anti-China bias in the algorithm can hardly see the whole picture of what's going on in Hong Kong.
Anti-China echo chamber
Twitter has long been accused of failing its users by creating echo chambers that fuel polarization. A study released by the Pew Research Center in April found that the world constructed by Twitter feeds is not even close to the real world, as about 80 percent of all the tweets are created by the most active 10 percent of users.
When it comes to deciding whose voices matter, Twitter picks a side, and it has even stopped hiding.
After Twitter's vice-president of public policy, Colin Crowell, met with the Hong Kong activists who flew to Washington to seek political support in September, the platform proclaiming its neutrality can no longer fool the world with its ""free speech"" slogans.
Crowell retweeted a post published by one of the activists he met, Denise Ho, thanking him and his team for their ""good work in making people's voices heard"". While three days before the retweet, Twitter suspended 4,301 accounts originating in China, following a purge in August that wiped out 936 Chinese accounts that, according to the ""examples of violative content"" the platform provided, denounced the violence of masked rioters in Hong Kong.
Whose voices matter to Twitter? It's more than clear.
By suppressing Chinese accounts in the name of curbing State-backed information operations, Twitter is in effect creating an anti-China echo chamber.
Twitter said that it will continue enforcing its content policing policies ""to serve the public conversation"". The problem is how could there be any conversation when only a one-sided view on the ongoing Hong Kong unrest is allowed to be heard?
Political bias has saved Twitter
Algorithms should not take all the blame, because deep down there is a political angle in Twitter's anti-China algorithm.
Apart from his own meeting with leading Hong Kong activists, Colin Crowell retweeted their posts of meeting US Senator Ed Markey, to whom Crowell was a longtime staffer.
Markey is one of the US politicians that have kept playing the ""Hong Kong card"". He went further by tabling a new bill to amend the so-called United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, which China criticized as evidence of US interference.
Among Twitter's myriad connections to US politicians, the one to US President Donald Trump is the most remarkable for the simple fact that the outspoken president and his followers have arguably saved the once ailing platform from dying.
Trump's tweets have caused controversy time and again. Meanwhile Twitter, which proclaims it holds all accounts to the same standards on its content policies, has for years turned a blind eye to violations by the US president in the name of ""newsworthiness"".
Twitter exposes Western hostility
Western media outlets often castigate China in apparent ignorance of the values gap. Fear of being taken over by China's rise and hubris about their political system are noticeable everywhere in their reports. What is not mentioned in their narratives is China's reiteration of its peaceful development path and the popularity enjoyed by its government.
The Western media fail to recognize their own prejudices and keep promulgating hostility toward China. Take the Hong Kong unrest for instance. Protesters' occupation of the airport was glossed over as ""peaceful"", despite the vicious attack on a mainland journalist. Police use of force is amplified as ""brutality"" even when they have exercised restraint and tolerance. Given the regularity of protests in the city, The Atlantic once described Hong Kong police as ""expert in crowd management"". Ironically this time, the Western media denounced them as ""perpetrators"" of government violence because they do not share the police's stance.
In selectively exaggerating what they want to report and neglecting what they do not want to report, Western media outlets, colluding with social media networks such as Twitter, manipulate public opinion on Hong Kong in disregard of facts.
Since Morey's tweet, the Western media has chased after the NBA for comments on Hong Kong protests that suit their narrative - without much success.
Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who has been vocal on human rights issues, said he was uncomfortable to comment on matters he doesn't understand.
Kerr compared the Hong Kong unrest to the gun violence problems in the US. ""People in China didn't ask me about, you know, people owning AR-15s and mowing each other down in a mall,"" he said at a news conference on Oct 11.
The fallout of Morey's ignorant tweet should have introduced him to the other side of the Hong Kong protests. Does Morey now know that the violence of the rioters was deliberately hid from users like him on Twitter?

Twitter seeks to set biased agenda,"Before the coming of the internet age, many a person wishfully harbored a devout hope that the free flow of information availed by almighty technology would make the world better. At least, for some.
But as the internet celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, many people have come to realize that the so-called freedom of speech that was heralded with its arrival is nothing but a side-effect of the civil use of the technology that stemmed from the ARPANET, Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, which the US Department of Defense launched in 1969, rather than an inherent characteristic. For the technology not only lowers the costs of information flow, but also of information control.
Which, in other words, vests the large-scale social media platforms with almost unrestricted discretionary power in setting the agenda of the opinion market and public debate.
In this context, it came as no real surprise that Twitter shut down 4,301 accounts on Friday, for ""violating its policy"", as it unilaterally decided these accounts ""were attempting to sow discord about the protest movement in Hong Kong"" - it closed 936 accounts for a similar reason last month.
Most of the accounts it sentenced to death took a clear-cut stand against the violence of the rioters in Hong Kong, which after nearly four months, has taken a heavy toll on the city's economy and rule of law.
Yet such a stance is natural to all rational minds. Saying no to violence does not necessarily mean that the voices of all the Hong Kong demonstrators should be muffled. Separating the violent demands of the rioters from the appeals of peaceful protesters is a prerequisite to end the chaos while letting people's grievances be heeded.
But under the considerate protection of Twitter's ""transparency and openness"" policy, the accounts of violent demonstrators, along with their agitators, are flourishing, while the accounts of those with opposing views are eliminated.
The company obviously feels no qualms about standing on the wrong side of history, as the appeals of the users it selectively protects directly challenge China's sovereignty in the city, by overstepping the boundary of its rights.
Twitter is obliged to control the disinformation being spread by the troublemakers in Hong Kong and their supporters, as they are the persons who are intent on using radical and violent means to incite hatred, sow discord and divide a sovereign state, and who are holding the city hostage and bending freedom and democracy for their own ends."
Rioters must be held accountable to restore order in Hong Kong,"International conventions such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights explain what a ""democratic society"" is or should be. In general, a democratic society should be pluralistic and inclusive, and have space for different points of view, which should be expressed in a peaceful manner.
Since Hong Kong's return to China in 1997, the ""one country, two systems"" principle has helped yield universally acknowledged positive results. ""One country, two systems"" allows Hong Kong people to govern the special administrative region and enjoy a high degree of autonomy. Which makes the SAR a democratic and rule-based society.
However, the demonstrations that started in opposition to a bill to amend the SAR's extradition law soon turned violent, taking a heavy toll on the city. The demonstrations transformed into a seesaw battle between the police and radical protesters. And the violent demonstrators, who increasingly used gasoline bombs and attacked police officers, have undermined the rule of law in the city.
The violent demonstrators even tried to break into the SAR Legislative Council building, indiscriminately damaging LegCo property. Worse, they defiled the national emblem and national flag.
The insurrectionists even blocked Hong Kong International Airport, the subway and main traffic hubs, and vandalized public property, paralyzing normal life in the city. In other words, they have held the city to ransom to fulfill their narrow political goals.
Yet their extreme acts, which are tantamount to ""terrorism"", have been ignored by some Western media outlets and governments. Some in the West have even called the insurrectionists ""pro-democracy fighters"" when the truth is that the demonstrators have thrown SAR residents' daily life out of gear and harmed their livelihoods, as well as tarnished Hong Kong's image as ""Asia's world city"" and an international finance and logistics hub.
It is ironical that the ""pro-democracy"" demonstrators claim to be protecting universal values despite doing exactly the opposite: breaking the law, and trampling democracy, human rights and freedom.
Claiming to be fighting for freedom of speech and human rights, the rioters have tried to stifle sane voices, because they do not care for other people's human rights, especially if those people do not support their ""cause of rioting"".
Some Western politicians, and media outlets have been making irresponsible remarks glorifying the insurrectionists and supporting the violence in an attempt to whitewash the crimes of the violent demonstrators - and to further incite youths and heighten tensions. The real intention of these Western hypocrites is to cause chaos in the city and exploit the situation in a bid to check China's rise.
Some Western politicians and media outlets have pointed an accusing finger at the Hong Kong police, claiming they have abused their power. But they will never succeed in their evil designs, because there is a consensus among sensible people across the world that the Hong Kong police have exercised considerable restraint, which has even made them vulnerable to attacks.
The situation in Hong Kong is serious, as some radical demonstrators have crossed the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle, which will have dire consequences.
Rational, law-abiding Hong Kong residents have organized many rallies to oppose the violence. And it is such law-abiding residents that represent the public opinion in the SAR. The Hong Kong police and judiciary should not only be supported but also encouraged to take resolute measures and hold the rioters accountable so as to restore public order in the city.
There are many lessons to be learned from the chaos in Hong Kong. But first, the SAR authorities have to put an end to the violence, which is necessary to build a platform for dialogue and implement institutional reforms to help the city recover and return to the track of development.

Man set afire as rioters escalate violence in HK,"Hong Kong witnessed one of the most disturbing incidents on Monday amid the ongoing protests that first erupted in mid-June, as a man was set on fire by a masked radical.
As seen in a video circulating online, the man's clothing was ignited by a radical protester after he was doused with what is believed to be an accelerant as he quarreled with several others on a footbridge in Ma On Shan, New Territories.
During the confrontation, the man, wearing a green shirt, argued with the protesters and told them they were all Chinese, the video showed.
He ended up suffering severe burns and is in critical condition in a hospital. The attacker is believed to have escaped.
Earlier, the green-shirted man was seen trying to stop some protesters from vandalizing Ma On Shan MTR Station, another video showed.
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor stressed on Monday that the SAR government will not yield to the violence of rioters and accede to their demands. The rioters will never succeed, she said.
""If there's still any wishful thinking that by escalating violence, the Hong Kong SAR government will yield to pressure to satisfy the so-called political demands, I'm making this statement loud and clear here - this will not happen,"" Lam said.
She made the remark while addressing a news briefing after citywide riots caused dozens of injuries among residents on Monday.
Lam reiterated that violence will not provide any solution to the current problems of Hong Kong. She called on all people in Hong Kong, regardless of their political views, to agree that the priority was to stop the violence and restore calm in the city as soon as possible.
In a news conference on Monday afternoon, police confirmed the attack on the man and called it ""inhumane"".
Strongly condemning the attack, a police representative criticized the suspect for ""disregarding the life of others to make a political stand"".
Police are investigating the case. As of 6 pm Monday, no one had yet been arrested, police said.
The attack was condemned by prominent figures. Solicitor Kennedy Wong Ying-ho said the incident is ""absolutely shocking"" as the radical attacked someone who did not even have any physical conflict with him.
He noted that the perpetrator could be charged with attempted murder, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
Lau Siu-kai, vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, told China Daily that the incident showed that the emotionally driven radicals, often armed with dangerous items, posed a grave danger to unarmed citizens.
Urging the rioters to show more respect for others' safety, Lau also called for more powerful and effective measures from authorities to quell violence and uphold public safety.
Fresh round of violence 
Hong Kong suffered a fresh round of violent unrest on Monday as protesters attacked and vandalized numerous public facilities, subway stations and university campuses.
Besides setting fires at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, they also vandalized facilities at Hong Kong Baptist University where they targeted shops such as Pacific Coffee and a school canteen owned by restaurant chain Maxim's.
Pacific Coffee is owned by a mainland group, and the eldest daughter of Maxim's founder recently voiced opposition to violence by the protesters.
On Monday morning, two gasoline bombs were thrown into a train car full of passengers at Kwai Fong Station.
The protesters also hurled gasoline bombs into Tung Chung Station and set fires in Heng On Station.
Twenty-five MTR stations had to shut down temporarily and several metro lines suspended service, MTR Corp said in a statement.
Because of the mayhem on Monday, nearly all universities in the city suspended classes.

Washington rebuked for meddling in HK protests,"The Foreign Ministry criticized the United States on Tuesday for meddling in Hong Kong's recent protests against the now-suspended extradition amendment bill.
Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the ministry, made the remark after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said earlier at the Economic Club in Washington that the Hong Kong protests are ""appropriate"" and protests are ""common"" in the US. Pompeo added that he hoped China will ""do the right thing"" and respect agreements that are in place with respect to Hong Kong.
In a daily news conference in Beijing, Hua said protests in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have recently included people attacking police with metal poles and other potentially deadly weapons.
Maybe the US could ""import"" such violent protests and show the world how their democracy would handle them, Hua said.
Since February, many US politicians have openly commented on Hong Kong affairs, and have met with the city's opposition politicians multiple times, Hua said. These include US Vice-President Mike Pence, Pompeo and National Security Advisor John Bolton.
Hua added that media footage showed some ""American faces"" and the US national flag in Hong Kong's recent protests. She questioned whether the US is playing a role in the ongoing weekslong chaos in the city and urged them to clarify that for the world.
The US must stop ""playing with fire"", which will only get itself burned, Hua said.
Meanwhile, the US must clearly understand that the HKSAR is part of China, and it has been reiterated many times that the Chinese government will not allow foreign interference in Hong Kong's internal affairs or foreign forces to bring chaos to the city, she said.
Hua's remarks came as trade talks begin between the two nations on Tuesday and Wednesday in Shanghai.
In Hong Kong, the chaos continues. Commuters expressed anger and frustration over a four-hour subway service suspension on Tuesday morning.
This past weekend, radical protesters clashed with riot police in Yuen Long and parts of Hong Kong Island, venting anger over the now-suspended extradition bill.
They blocked train doors and activated emergency brakes and safety devices to prevent trains from leaving stations on four busy subway routes - the Kwun Tong, Island, Tseung Kwan O and Tsuen Wan lines.
The Hong Kong police announced on Tuesday night that they were pressing charges against 45 people arrested during the anti-government demonstration on Sunday.
Forty-four will be charged with rioting. Among them, a 33-year-old man was also charged with assaulting a police officer. A 24-year-old man was charged with possession of offensive weapons. All are scheduled to appear in the Eastern Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.
On Sunday night, police arrested 49 people. As of press time, two men had been released on bail pending further investigation, and the other two were temporarily released.
The subway disruption ""was annoying"", said Janice Huang, who lives in Tseung Kwan O but works in Sheung Wan on Hong Kong Island. It took her nearly two-and-a-half hours to reach her workplace. Her commute usually takes around 40 minutes. ""Disrupting public transportation sometimes leads to bad results. What if someone has important work to do?"" she said.
According to subway system operator MTR Corp, a train was forced to remain at a platform in Tiu Keng Leng station for over an hour, because emergency brakes installed on the trains and platforms of the affected metro lines were activated 123 times from around 7:30 am to around 11:20 am.
People should adopt rational and peaceful ways to express their views, rather than resorting to means that cause a public nuisance, Hong Kong's Secretary for Transport and Housing Frank Chan Fan said on Tuesday.

More voices call for end to violence in HK,"People from all walks of life in Hong Kong formed a united front on Friday to speak out against violence after the city has endured radicalism and unrest since mid-June as a result of repeated protests.
Business tycoons like Li Ka-shing and entertainers including Charmaine Sheh expressed their concerns over the escalating violence and called for the restoration of the rule of law.
Their appeals came amid worries of more possible clashes over the weekend between radicals and the police and a call for students to boycott classes as the new school year begins in about two weeks.
Hong Kong has seen protesters blocking roads, setting fires and besieging government buildings and police stations more than 70 times in 18 days since June 9, Central District Commander Tse Ming-yeung said on Friday. Protests have also seriously affected the normal operation of Hong Kong International Airport, one of the world's busiest traffic hubs.
After the city's economy and people's livelihoods started to feel the pinch from the monthslong turmoil, Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing took out advertisements in several local newspapers on Friday urging an end to violence. Earlier, another tycoon, Peter Woo Kwong-ching, also spoke out against the unrest.
Hong Kong's pop stars and celebrities on Friday also called for the return to law and order in the city. Actress Sheh, actor Shawn Yue Man-lok and singer Yeung Chin-Wah all stressed that Hong Kong is an inalienable part of China.
The Motion Picture Industry Association in Hong Kong said in a statement that the people of Hong Kong have a right to pursue their political agendas, but they can't cross the bottom line of humanity and morality. Nor should they endanger others and destabilize society, or harm national sovereignty.
""If such antagonism and rifts continue, Hong Kong will lose its glory and be beyond redemption,"" the statement continued.
Multinational firms in Hong Kong and chambers of commerce have also warned against the impact of escalating violence and disruptions to Hong Kong's economy, residents' livelihoods as well as the city's image abroad.
Peter Wong, deputy chairman and chief executive of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, said that as a global financial center, Hong Kong has a solid foundation and its hard-won position and reputation should be cherished by its residents.
Though people expressing their opinions peacefully should be respected, ""violent incidents have been going on one after another and the situation is getting worse, affecting local people's livelihood and endangering public safety"", Wong said.
Concerns over more turmoil 
Hong Kong police announced on Friday that they had rejected march applications in three different locations over the weekend - To Kwa Wan, Hung Hom and Hong Kong Island - on security grounds. A public gathering at Victoria Park was approved.
Police received more than 1,280 objections from various groups and individuals against the planned marches at the three locations, all of which are major tourism areas, saying it they were very likely to cause similar violent clashes.
On Saturday, Hong Kong is expected to see a large number of people coming out to say no to violence and pull the city back from the brink of a dangerous situation that many have warned of. The rally, one of the many moves taken by Hong Kong residents, will be held at 5 pm on Saturday in Tamar Park, Hong Kong Island.
Just one day after an online signature petition was voluntarily initiated by a group of Hong Kong residents on Thursday, about 100,000 people have signed up to demand the city return to peace and order.
With the new school year drawing closer, Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yunhung on Friday also voiced his objection to a call by radicals to boycott classes.
In his social media page, Yeung said school is an apolitical place where students should be free from political interference.
Due to the tense social environment over the past few months, Yeung and his colleagues set out to meet with stakeholders from the education sector to prepare students and teachers to ease into the new school year.
Cathay Pacific reshuffle 
Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways said on Friday that Rupert Hogg had resigned as the chief executive officer and Paul Loo resigned as the chief customer and commercial officer, with effect from Monday.
Augustus Tang has been appointed as Hogg's replacement, while Ronald Lam replaces Loo.
The reshuffle of the senior executives came after the country's top civil aviation regulator issued a security risk warning to Cathay Pacific and banned its staff involved in radical protests from flying in mainland airspace.
Noting that recent events have called into question Cathay Pacific's commitment to flight safety and security and put the airline's reputation and brand under pressure, Chairman John Slosar said: ""We therefore think it is time to put a new management team in place who can reset confidence and lead the airline to new heights. Cathay Pacific is fully committed to Hong Kong under the principle of 'one country, two systems' as enshrined in the Basic Law.""

Those serving the public in Hong Kong have a duty to uphold social order,"The failure of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority to properly deal with the arrest of a public hospital doctor in connection with the heightened violence over the past weekend showed how some key players in the special administrative region are not doing their part to help bring an end to the current lawlessness.
The doctor, arrested on Sunday in the Pop-Corn mall in Tseung Kwan O where protesters vandalized shops and facilities, is affiliated with the Tseung Kwan O Hospital.
Subsequent to his arrest, the HKHA, a statutory body running all public hospitals in the city, issued a statement that it was very concerned about the arrested doctor and was ready to provide him with the necessary assistance and support.
But it did not voice any concern about their employees' possible involvement in illegal activities outside the hospital, nor did it condemn the violent protests which have sent so many injured police officers, protesters, journalists and innocent bystanders to the emergency wards in the past few months.
Not only is the HKHA not providing moral support to the police in maintaining law and order, it has turned a blind eye toward some of their medical personnel's non-cooperation with police officers executing their duties and their taking part in rallies in support of the ongoing anti-government campaign.
Which is why more than 600 disgruntled medical personnel have recently issued a joint statement in a newspaper voicing their support for the law enforcement agents and condemning the ongoing violence.
The battle against this unprecedented challenge to the special administrative region's rule of law should not be fought only by the police. All other key players in society are responsible for helping Hong Kong maintain its social order, peace and prosperity.
Its civil servants, in particular, have the responsibility to take care of the interests of local residents whom they are supposed to serve. For instance, a group of firemen who were seen standing by when a resident was attacked by a group of rioters should have taken action to save the man.
Another major player in upholding the rule of law in Hong Kong is the legal sector. However, the Hong Kong Bar Association has been reluctant to display strong disapproval of the current violence and lawlessness even after the extradition law amendment bill, which it opposed, has been withdrawn. One of its vice-chairmen has just resigned to show his frustration.
Public servants have a duty to ensure their actions don't do anything that will bring their employer into disrepute or affect the employee's ability to carry out their duties.
But the good news is the majority of Hong Kong residents stand firmly behind the police. They are telling them: You are not walking alone."
Homicide suspect offers chance to end unrest,"Editor's Note: A man who inadvertently triggered Hong Kong's huge protests after returning to the special administrative region to avoid being tried in Taiwan for killing his girlfriend, has agreed to return to the island to face justice. China Daily writer Wu Yixue comments:
The Hong Kong government announced on Friday that Chan Tong-kai, a resident of the special administrative region who is wanted in Taiwan for the murder of his pregnant girlfriend, had sent a letter to the chief executive expressing his decision to surrender himself to the authorities in Taiwan upon his release from prison, where he is serving a 29 month sentence for theft.
The Taiwan authorities issued an arrest warrant for Chan on Dec 3, 2018. However, Chan could not be sent back to face the charges in Taiwan because there is no extradition agreement between Taiwan and Hong Kong.
The case of Chan, who has admitted to killing Poon Hiu-wing, prompted the Hong Kong government to amend the SAR's Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance, a move that was the original spark for the protests in Hong Kong, which have since escalated into violent anti-government riots. The months-long unrest has not only seriously undermined Hong Kong's rule of law and damaged its tourism industry and other sectors, it has also cast a shadow over the city's status as one of the world's leading economic and financial hubs.
As a city that lacks its own material resources, Hong Kong's development to a large degree rests on the Chinese mainland's policy support and the strong confidence it can gather from various social circles based on its rule of law and good governance. The continuing unrest and violence have shaken this foundation.
The HK authorities have said Chan made the decision purely of his own free will and have firmly rejected any suggestion that he was manipulated to surrender.
It is hoped that with the transfer of Chan's case to Taiwan, various circles in Hong Kong can end their divergences, return to consensus and jointly push forward the city's development.

Tsai's ploys doomed to failure,"Of all the issues that threaten to derail the relationship between China and the United States, the US arms sales to Taiwan have stood out as being the most contentious. That explains why the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council on Thursday expressed strong opposition, a second time within the week, to the US' planned $8 billion sale of F-16V fighter jets to Taiwan.
The multibillion-dollar sale would include 66 aircraft, 75 General Electric engines, as well as other systems, according to an official notification delivered to the US Congress on Tuesday, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said.
Washington alleges that the sale, like previous ones to the island, serves US national, economic and security interests and will help Taiwan maintain a credible deterrence.
Over the years, the US has ignored the vows it has made in bilateral agreements on scaling down and phasing out its arms sales to Taiwan. By selling arms to the island, it has repeatedly broken the commitment it made to put an end to them, breached its one-China policy and interfered in China's internal affairs. Selling arms to Taiwan may bring in some money, but it also emboldens the island's separatists.
The island's leader Tsai Ing-wen and her secessionist-minded government would do well to accept the fact that their attempts to court US support to push their independence agenda will be to no avail. Neither Washington nor Taiwan should underestimate the Chinese mainland's determination to safeguard its territorial integrity and sovereignty.
Yet begging for US arms sales is not the only sin of Tsai and her government. This week Taiwan also drew much ire from the mainland over its offer of political asylum to participants in Hong Kong's ""pro-democracy"" protest movement.
Tsai's administration obviously wants to encourage the criminal acts of Hong Kong radicals. With the Western media politicizing the demonstrations by terming them anti-government protests and putting their focus on a vocal few calling for Hong Kong's independence, she is keen to align the island with their demands.
However, with the demonstrators in Hong Kong realizing that they are being led astray and have gone too far, the sensationalism that brought the media circus to the special administrative region will likely end. Without the oxygen of publicity, Tsai will have to swallow the bitter fruit that she has further damaged the island's relations with Beijing and should be held accountable for consequences."
Hong Kong's mask ban protects the innocent,"The carefully orchestrated global outrage over Hong Kong's new ban on face masks is the latest example of an Orwellian process: Traditional and historically admirable (or apparently admirable) measures and values are systematically hijacked by global forces of neo-imperialism, greed, jealousy, hatred and oppression.
The purpose of this exercise is to subvert and wreck peaceful law-abiding nations from within, leaving them open to carefully orchestrated foreign aggressions that wreak havoc on the lives of scores of millions of people.
Historically, enforcing bans on face masks was a move recognized by responsible governments, whether democratic, oligarchical or autocratic to protect their populations from criminals and terrorists. In recent years, leading Western nations that were quick to criticize others for not allegedly meeting their own standards have revived, strengthened or freshly introduced such laws.
Canada introduced Bill C-309 into its Parliament which became law on June 19, 2013. This legislation expressly forbids the wearing of any masks during a riot or other unlawful assembly. The purpose of this law is both clear and admirable: It is to protect law-abiding citizens from the terror of any mob. Those convicted of breaking the law face sentences of up to a decade in prison.
Mobs can be dangerous and run out of control to cause riots, racist pogroms and other violence at any time. The dark story of anti-Jewish pogroms or mob riots, fanned by ignorance and religious bigotry across Eastern Europe in the 19th century and even well into the 20th century is well known.
Almost unknown is the failure of the British authorities in India to protect minority Muslim communities during Mohandas K. Gandhi's enormous allegedly ""non-violent"" demonstrations against British rule in the 1920s and 1930s.
Gandhi wisely and cunningly worked overtime to provoke the British and restrain his own followers from attacking the British-controlled and well-armed police and army forces. But Hindus mobs supporting his own Congress Party repeatedly rampaged through Muslim areas killing tens of thousands of people overall.
The anti-mask ban in Hong Kong is a responsible and moderate effort by the special administrative region's government to maintain law and order to protect its population overall. The ban also serves to protect outspoken, targeted critics of the protests from terrorist and mob attacks and even lynching.
In the United States, such laws already exist in dozens of states. Many of them were enacted in the 1950s and 1960s specifically to protect non-violent protestors against segregation in the Civil Rights movement from being beaten up or murdered. In some cases, the laws were specifically enacted to prevent the notorious Ku Klux Klan being permitted to march publicly but secretly beneath its fearsome hoods. For more than a century by that time the Klan had reveled in its dark reputation as ""The Secret Empire.""
Also, many continental Western European countries west of Sweden and Poland have enacted such laws or comparable ones.
Russia also has similar legislation. None of the European Union states that have enacted such legislation has been subjected to the torrent of abuse for enacting them that China is now suddenly facing.
Ironically, the ban on face masks is more effective in the 21st century than ever before. This is because the proliferation of millions of closed circuit television cameras around the world has been a boon to global law enforcement wherever it has been applied.
China has predictably been criticized for investing heavily in CCTV technology, which is of inestimable value in protecting the safety of potentially billions of ordinary people around the world. But the great pioneer work in using such systems to ensure public security was actually undertaken by the government of the United Kingdom which is now so critical of China's commitment to the same kind of systems to ensure public safety.
Obviously, permitting mobs of thousands of people to wear masks would allow criminal elements to go berserk in killing, rapes and despoiling shops and other centers of commerce. Even the economic damage suffered by the collapse of law enforcement in such conditions creates pathologies and depressed economic conditions that last for decades.
The critics of Hong Kong's very timely and sensible new law have no love or true concern for the people of the special administrative region: On the contrary, they want to feed millions of innocent people into the jaws of lawlessness, anarchy and the breakdown of order and justice.
Masks hide the identities of heroes in US comic books: But in the real world it is murderers, rapists and robbers who resort to them, not to enforce justice but to destroy it. The lines between right and wrong, peace and conflict, security and terror in the Hong Kong violence grow clearer by the day.

Barbarous protests in Hong Kong terrorize its law-abiding citizens,"The anti-mask law introduced by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government on Oct 4 has proved effective in reducing the number of protesters on the street, as now that they can no longer hide their identities and are prone to arrest, many of the rioters have lost the courage of anonymity.
However, to make up for the growing manpower shortage, the organizers of the rioting have compensated by raising the intensity of the violence that has seen running battles between rioters and the police in many parts of the city on a regular basis. That the violence has been intensified was evident on the weekend, when a police officer was seriously injured after he was slashed across the neck by a rioter with a parcel cutter, and many police vehicles were vandalized and police stations fire-bombed.
In a particularly alarming development, Hong Kong police say a homemade remote-controlled explosive device intended to ""kill or to harm"" police officers was detonated on Sunday.
Although no casualties were reported, Chinchiu Suryanto, an officer with the police force's bomb-disposal unit, told a news conference on Monday that it was like ""terrorist events"" seen elsewhere.
Certainly terrorists have no compunction about using violence and annihilating human values in pursuit of their aims. Indeed, violence is used to intimidate and coerce and to silence dissenting voices and punish any who oppose them, as well as to undermine belief in the authorities' ability to maintain law and order by provoking an extreme response against a particular group. All of which the protesters in Hong Kong hope to achieve with their increasingly vicious violence.
Shops and restaurants are trashed simply because the owners belong to those business groups speaking out against them. The MTR railway network has been systematically attacked, with station facilities vandalized and objects deliberately thrown onto railway tracks. The railway operator's ""guilt""? Not providing service to the rioters going to and from the scenes of violent protests.
Meanwhile, people confronting them on the street are viciously assaulted, often beaten senseless for speaking out against the protesters or on the slightest suspicion they might be acting against them.
While the dramatic surge of violence and lawlessness on the weekend may have been inspired by the appearance in person of US Republican senator Ted Cruz in the city on Saturday - A big irony in his remarks was that he didn't see any violence while touring the city. Perhaps compared to the US-engineered color revolutions elsewhere, the violence here is nothing - the underlying trend of the protests has been for them to become increasingly violent as the organizers try to give them the color veneer of an insurgency.
However, as President Xi Jinping made clear on Sunday, anyone attempting to split any part of the country from China is pursuing a pipe dream. His use of a phrase used by the Chinese when talking about their worst enemies - that they will have their bodies crushed and their bones turned to powder - shows that the country will not allow any terrorists and extremists of whatever hue to carve up the country, wherever they may be."
"With verve and vigor, Chinese fans get in step with flamenco","SHANGHAI - ""In flamenco songs, there's a line that goes: 'I fell into a deep well without a rope', which is exactly how I feel now,"" says 42-year-old Tao Jiarong, a Shanghai-based white-collar worker who likes to indulge in the Spanish art of flamenco.
Dating back to 15th-century Spain, flamenco combines singing, dancing and guitar playing using varied rhythms and rich emotional expressions to create an art form that is quintessentially Spanish.
Flamenco is generally believed to be an artistic product of the Roma, the nomadic ethnic group also known as Gypsies, and their uprooted lives of grief, protest, hope and catharsis.
The art form has long been synonymous with the famous opera Carmen in China, but for Tao, ""the deep well"" is more like an inexhaustible treasure, to which she has now devoted almost all of her spare time.
""Currently, Shanghai has around 400 flamenco trainees a year, a very small number compared to the city's total population of more than 24 million,"" Tao says. But that number has been on the rise in recent years.
In a neighborhood near Zhongshan Park in Shanghai, Tao comes to the flamenco dance studio founded by her friend Shi Yiqi every week. More than 20 participants from nearby areas receive introductory training at the studio, where professional foreign dancers help them learn more about this comprehensive art form.
Mastering flamenco is quite a different prospect to learning ballroom dancing, for example, as the latter requires more cooperation and coordination between the dancers while the former exudes less tangible, but undeniably enchanting, cultural connotations.
As interest in flamenco spreads in China, an increasing number of flamenco studios and workshops have sprung up to cater for fans of the art. Initially only in major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong or Taipei, flamenco studios are now a common sight in cities such as Nanjing, Xi'an, Changsha, Chengdu and Chongqing, according to Shi.
""Flamenco itself is the synthesis of art,"" Tao says.
Tao still recalls the first time she saw flamenco at a performance by the Spanish national ballet in Shanghai in 2008. She was so struck by the grace and passion of the dancers floating across the stage in red dresses, that she immediately signed up for flamenco lessons.
By the time Tao caught impromptu flamenco performances by Spanish dance masters at the Spanish pavilion of the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, she had a better understanding of it.
About three years ago, Tao decided to change from a flamenco dancer to a singer. While learning the songs, she soon realized that the exotic art was a kind of cultural treasure trove.
""Flamenco's philosophy is about fusion and acceptance. It's a kind of attitude. In the eyes of the audience, the dances and performances express extreme emotions, but ultimately, flamenco brings about self-reconciliation. I also feel reconciled with my heart and the world when I dance,"" says Tao.
Now, in addition to learning flamenco singing with Spanish performers via the internet, Tao also spends her holidays in Andalusia. There she is free to immerse herself in the range of singing styles found across the Spanish region, and also to take lessons and join in with performances.
""Shanghai now hosts several summer music festivals that feature flamenco music, giving people another channel to learn about the art form. More and more people are willing to travel to Spain to learn flamenco,"" Shi says, adding that her studio alone now has more than 80 trainee performers.
In flamenco, dancers in flower earrings flick and flutter across the stage like butterflies in trailing dresses - sweeping away any cultural differences in their path with a shared love for the arts.
Tao is happy that flamenco is gaining in popularity among Chinese people, but the country still lacks experienced musicians and singers. Tao and Shi plan to train more Chinese musicians and singers to help promote the art form in the future.
In 2018, they formed Shanghai's first homegrown flamenco band, which now plays regularly.
""Flamenco makes me feel alive. I have a hunch that I'll continue to love it in the future,"" Shi says.

US senator's remarks on HK 'sternly denounced',"The central government's foreign affairs office in Hong Kong ""sternly denounced"" on Thursday the remarks of a United States senator for his ""double standards"" in justifying violence in Hong Kong.
The Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region responded after Senator Marco Rubio, on his Twitter account on Tuesday, accused China of violating its promises on Hong Kong affairs amid the city's recent protests against the now-suspended extradition bill.
Rubio has applied double standards on violence and freedoms, the spokesman said.
He said that some US politicians refer to violence in their countries only as violence, while branding violence in other places a matter of human rights and freedom. They also call people who initiate violence ""human rights and freedom fighters"" instead of rioters, the spokesman said.
""Such a hypocritical and ridiculous application of double standards defiles and tramples upon the rule of law, and abets violent offenders,"" the spokesman said.
The spokesman said that since the HKSAR's return to the motherland, the central government has been committed to the ""one country, two systems"" principle in strict accordance with the national Constitution and the Basic Law, the SAR's constitutional document.
As a result, Hong Kong has maintained its prosperity and stability, and its people now enjoy unprecedented, extensive rights and freedoms in accordance with the law, the spokesman noted.
The spokesman reiterated that Hong Kong is part of China, and the central government firmly opposes any foreign interference in China's internal affairs. It also will not tolerate any effort to undermine national sovereignty, security or Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.
The spokesman denounced Rubio's accusation that the Communist Party of China used organized criminal groups to attack protesters in the SAR, saying those remarks are ""absolute nonsense"".

HK vows swift action against violence,"Hong Kong police on Friday called for calm and pledged to take swift action against any street violence or other illegal activities, irrespective of offenders' backgrounds or views.
The vow came as some protesters engaged in violent confrontations last weekend, resulting in eight injuries.
The expected rally on Saturday-Clean Hong Kong Day - organized by Legislator Junius Ho Kwan-yiu, is in an attempt to remove memos and notes containing political opinions on over 70""Lennon Walls"" in places such as underpasses and footbridges across the city.
The police will deploy manpower across various districts on Saturday in an attempt to prevent conflicts from escalating out of control, said Fang Chi-kin, superintendent of the Hong Kong Police operations wing, on Friday.
The Lennon Walls, more often than not, have been sites of violence over the past three months, Fang said. Since June, police launched 40 criminal investigations into physical confrontations taking place near the walls, and arrested 57 people on charges including assault and possession of offensive weapons.
While police have always respected the citizens' freedom of speech rights, they have to be carried out in a peaceful and orderly manner and no one should resort to violence, he added.
Later on Friday, a top Hong Kong police officer said that law enforcement officers were getting more and more united and determined as the protests and escalated violence mounted.
The top officer made the remarks during a closed-door media session at police headquarters in Wan Chai district on condition of anonymity. The city has endured 15 consecutive weeks of street protests which went from peaceful rallies to illegal protests with masked radicals resorting to escalating violence and extreme acts of vandalism.
The police unity and determination could be witnessed through resignation rates. He said the nonscheduled resignation rate for police so far this year is around 1.1 percent. The rate in 2018 was around 1.6 percent.
""We, the police force, won't be intimidated by any acts of violence,"" he said.
When asked about accusations of police officers allegedly using excessive force, the top official said it is fair to say Hong Kong's police force is one of the most restrained in the world, but some media just show a partial picture.
He said he went to New York in June and met with police officers. When he played video clips showing radicals' vandalism and then showed them what the media was saying, they were shocked at the huge differences between what's been written and what's been documented on camera.
He called for media to give accurate, fair and balanced media coverage on police actions.
It has been more than 100 days since the violent protests started in June. So far, 1,474 people have been arrested at illegal protests and 207 have since been charged.
He said he agreed in theory that if there were fast-track of court procedures, it would change the current situation as people, especially the young, would know that there is a price to pay for illegal acts.

Manipulated protests harming Hong Kong,"The celebrations to mark the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region as well as its image as Asia's World City were marred by a large mob of anti-government protestors who stormed and vandalized the Legislative Council complex in Admiralty.
It was a watershed moment for the SAR, as it let the world see who is upholding the rule of law and other core values of Hong Kong society and who is trying to undermine them.
But as well as the shocking rampage on Monday, in which a roused rabble broke into Hong Kong's legislature and defaced the portraits of lawmakers and spray-painted slogans in the chamber, the marked silence of Hong Kong's opposition lawmakers has also outraged many in Hong Kong who expected them to at least publicly condemn the appalling display of lawlessness and wanton destruction.
Opposition lawmakers, however, have chosen not to denounce the hooliganism. Instead, they have taken it as another opportunity to criticize the SAR government.
As a matter of fact, the anger among many of those resorting to violence has been inflamed by opposition lawmakers' rude behavior inside the legislative chamber over the years and they have been emboldened in their unruliness. Now these politicians do not have the courage to acknowledge their responsibility for the monster they have fostered and unleashed.
While the opposition camp has remained tight-lipped over the eruption of violence by those whose growing temerity they have helped to nurture, law-abiding Hong Kong residents have been horrified by such a brazen challenge to Hong Kong's law and order.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said she hopes the wider Hong Kong community will come together to censure those who defiled the legislature and has vowed to bring to justice all those responsible.
What has also been notable is the hypocrisy of some Western governments - the United States and United Kingdom most prominently - which have called for a stop to the violence, as if they have had nothing to do with it. But, looking back at the whole protest saga, they have been deeply involved in fueling it since its inception.
The consequences of these outside agitations have been the increasingly serious illegal actions that undermine Hong Kong's rule of law and social order and harm the fundamental interests of its residents.
That is why the Commissioner's Office of the Foreign Ministry in the HKSAR issued a statement on Tuesday denouncing foreign interference in Hong Kong affairs and demanding those Western governments stop fanning political unrest in Hong Kong."
Pence must abandon Cold War mind-set to show he really means what he says,"In his speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center on Thursday, US Vice-President Mike Pence repeated most of the anti-China clich¨¦s he used last year. But his renewed ""declaration of cold war"" against China contained some new accusations, ranging from the central governments' efforts to combat terrorism in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, and Hong Kong's efforts to quell violent protests in the special administrative region, to false charges of surveillance against China.
Referring, in US-style, to ""the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of the world"", Pence claimed the US ""built China over the last 25 years"", and US workers grew ""more disheartened"" with the closure of every factory in the US to the benefit of China.
Pence's description of the US as China's ""benefactor"" has only exposed his ignorance of the economic law of the international division of labor. China has made great developments through reform and opening-up, not by seeking favors from the US.
Talking about the US administration's largest tax cuts to benefit domestic companies and imposition of heavy tariffs on Chinese imports, Pence said: ""America has added trillions of dollars to our economy while China's economy continues to fall behind."" To use Pence's logic, if the US accumulated massive wealth in the past year, does it mean China was robbed by the ""benevolent"" US?
Pence even said the US imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials because of China's ""treatment of Muslim minorities"". But issuing a travel ban on officials is an old trick the US employs to force other countries to toe its line. For example, in January 2017, the US administration banned people from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the US. Many Muslim citizens of the US opposed the ban, saying the move would divide US society by further discriminating against Muslims.
More importantly, the US vice-president turned a blind eye to the development in Xinjiang and the improvement in people's lives there, as well as the US ill-treatment of Muslims in the US and the rest of the world.
Worse, Pence criticized ""Beijing's growing intervention of Hong Kong"", forgetting that Hong Kong is an integral part of China and enjoys a high degree of autonomy only under the ""one country, two systems"" framework. Pence also cited the China-United Kingdom joint declaration in 1984 to justify his interference in China's Hong Kong affairs, forgetting that the US is irrelevant to the declaration. And to refresh Pence's memory, the declaration does not endorse any violence in the SAR.
If Pence believes the rioters, who vandalized the Hong Kong Legislative Council building, attacked police stations and civilians, and paralyzed the traffic in the city, were holding ""peaceful protests"", then he and his fellow politicians should encourage more such ""peaceful protests"" in the US.
Further, Pence's accusation that China carries out ""surveillance"" against foreign countries and politicians is more of a slap in the face of the US, as the world knows that it is Washington that spies on politicians from not only countries that it considers ""rivals"", as he indicated in his address, but also from countries which are US allies, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
The ""Prism"" scandal exposed by former US National Security Agency official Edward Snowden in 2013 showed how the US used its powerful surveillance network to spy on the whole world. Ironically, the US vice-president flaunted the US surveillance network while trying to tarnish China's image by accusing it of taking unnecessarily harsh security measures.
In fact, in his attempt to accuse China of running a surveillance network, Pence has actually admitted the US runs the most powerful surveillance network in the world.
Indeed, if, as Pence claimed, the US does not intend to contain China's rise or ""decouple"" with China, it has to match its words with actions. Or else, his speech would mean US politicians have not given up their attempts to force China on the political front to boost their domestic political agenda.
China wants to maintain a new type of major country relationship with the US, which benefits both countries and the world. But for that, US politicians like Pence need to abandon their Cold War mind-set.

US bill to halt sales of riot gear to HK blasted,"China slammed some United States lawmakers for displaying a double standard on Wednesday over a bill they introduced to stop sales of nonlethal crowd control equipment to Hong Kong, urging them to stop indulging violence and crime.
""It is exactly because of some US politicians' indulgence and support that anti-China people and chaos creators in Hong Kong act so unscrupulously and brazenly,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said of the bill.
The legislation was announced on Tuesday and is sponsored by three US lawmakers, the South China Morning Post reported. If passed, the bill would prohibit US companies from exporting nonlethal crowd control items like tear gas, as well as defense articles and services, to Hong Kong, it reported.
Speaking of the situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Hua said it is very clear what is right and what is wrong, and more and more international mainstream media are reporting the truth after conducting interviews in the city.
""Where is the rule of law that you value when radical and violent people attack brutally and harm Hong Kong police and disrupt the airport and railway? Where are the human rights that you parade when personal information of hundreds of police officers and their family members were illegally disclosed, and they were exposed to wild bullying and intimidation online?
""Where is the freedom you advocate when people with different points of view were chased, beaten, besieged, confined and hurt by masked people in black?"" Hua asked the politicians.
The US lawmakers are mischaracterizing the violence and slandering the Hong Kong police's law enforcement with restraint, which is ""the greatest profanation of freedom, democracy and human rights,"" she added.
Citing protests in the US, including those in Portland, Oregon, Hua said, ""Will these US lawmakers be so kind if what is happening in Hong Kong happened in the US?""
They should stop their dangerous play with issues concerning Hong Kong, as such attempts will only backfire, the spokeswoman said.

Returning to rule of law 'only way' for HKSAR,"Principle of 'one country, two systems' protects State sovereignty, city's stability
Returning to the rule of law is the only way to solve the current problem in Hong Kong, a leading legislator and legal scholar on the mainland said on Thursday as Hong Kong's silent majority raised their voices against violence.
The rule of law is the basic consensus and core value of Hong Kong society, but the recent series of violent incidents has seriously damaged the rule of law and hurt the feelings of people around the country, said Han Dayuan, a member of Hong Kong Basic Law Committee under the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the country's top legislature.
Illegal gatherings and acts of violence have continued in Hong Kong, including the assaults on two mainland residents, one of them a reporter, by radicals at Hong Kong International Airport on Tuesday. A total of 748 people have been arrested in violent protests since June 9, the Hong Kong police said on Thursday.
""The airport violence was an open challenge to the rule of law and seriously damaged Hong Kong as a society under the rule of law,"" said Han, also a professor at the Law School of Renmin University of China and director of the university's law institute on the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
""Faced with such serious violence and a split society, the only way to solve the current problem is for the entire society to get back on the track of the rule of law,"" he said. ""I believe this is the basic consensus of the great majority of Hong Kong people.""
Han emphasized that the primary aim of the principle of ""one country, two systems"" and the Basic Law is to safeguard State sovereignty, unity and territory integrity, as well as to maintain the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.
""Any acts to challenge State sovereignty and unity affects the bottom line of the 'one country, two systems' principle,"" he said.
Laws provide legal backing for central authorities to take action if the HKSAR government cannot control the situation, Han said.
Article 14 of the Garrison Law states that the SAR government can request that the central government let the People's Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong help maintain local public order.
The Constitution and the Basic Law also grant the NPC Standing Committee the power to judge and directly announce an emergency status for Hong Kong, under which the PLA Hong Kong garrison can perform its duties accordingly, Han said.
However, he emphasized that these are ""preventive institutional or legal provisions"" in laws, and activating such rules needs to meet at least two conditions - that social unrest has threatened national unity or security and that the SAR government is not capable of handling it.
Liu Xiaoming, China's ambassador to the United Kingdom, said on Thursday that should the situation in Hong Kong deteriorate further into unrest that the Hong Kong government cannot control, the central government will not sit on its hands and watch.
""We have enough solutions and enough power within the limits of the Basic Law to quell any unrest swiftly,"" he said during a news conference in London.
More condemnation
On Thursday, more Hong Kong people voiced objections to the escalation of violence at the city's airport.
Several local newspapers published a joint statement from Hong Kong residents on their front pages, urging the city to return to peace and order as soon as possible.
Following a call for strict law enforcement against rioters and any illegal act supporting unrest, the statement said that the government should not approve any march or assembly before the city returns to order. They appealed to parents and teachers not to allow their children and students to participate in unlawful activities.
Another group of 16 celebrities from the city's culture and arts industry, including actress Liza Wong Ming-Chuen, made a similar statement on Thursday. They slammed the unlawful attacks as ""going far beyond the bottom line of a civilized society"".
On Wednesday, NPC deputies and national political advisers from Hong Kong condemned the violent acts. All deputies to the NPC from Hong Kong said in a statement that the violent acts have seriously undermined the core value of the rule of law and undermined the order and tranquility of Hong Kong.
The violence was a heavy blow to the economy and people's livelihoods, and destroyed the good international image and reputation of Hong Kong's security and rule of law, it read.
Many Hong Kong members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the country's political advisers, called for Hong Kong law enforcement to investigate and punish rioters in accordance with the law.
Thirteen Hong Kong-based academicians from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the China Engineering Academy on Wednesday also warned that extremely violent acts will destroy Hong Kong's future.

Lam: Sovereignty threats intolerable,"Any act advocating Hong Kong's independence or threatening China's sovereignty, security and development interests will not be tolerated, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said on Wednesday.
In her 2019 Policy Address, Lam reiterated her commitment to adherence to the ""one country, two systems"" principle as Hong Kong finds ways to ""emerge from the storm and embrace the rainbow"" amid prolonged chaos across the city.
Lam said the principle has proved to be the best way to ensure the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong since its return to the motherland 22 years ago.
It is also the ""common aspiration"" of the country, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Chinese people to successfully implement the principle, she said.
""Despite the stormy times and overwhelming difficulties Hong Kong is experiencing, I believe that so long as we accurately adhere to the principle of 'one country, two systems', we will be able to get out of the impasse,"" Lam said.
She stressed the importance of safeguarding the rule of law, ""a core value of paramount importance to Hong Kong"", which is the cornerstone of the city's success.
She also called on all parties to take on their responsibilities to protect Hong Kong's institutional strengths developed by different bodies and organizations.
Lam's policy address comes as Hong Kong has been rocked by months of violent protests. In her speech, the chief executive put forward over 220 new initiatives to address the city's social and economic problems, with a key focus on land and housing. The initiatives also include measures on improving people's livelihoods and economic development.
Hong Kong lawmaker Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee spoke highly of Lam's delivery of the Policy Address.
The nonofficial members of the Executive Council recognized Lam and her government's efforts to solve the city's deep-seated problems, saying Lam's policy address shows their concern for the people.
""We believe that the chief executive has the determination and capability to take forward initiatives that are beneficial to Hong Kong's economy and people's livelihoods. The Executive Council fully supports the government and will continue to offer its advice on the implementation of measures for improving people's livelihoods,"" said Bernard Chan, council convenor.
The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce said in a statement that it hopes the proposals laid out by Lam will start paving a path for recovery and reconciliation.
""While we welcome the measures that have been announced in the policy address, there is clearly a lot more work to be done in rebuilding Hong Kong and healing the divisions in society,"" Chamber Chairman Aron Harilela said.
""We hope that the measures set out in the policy address will be a firm step toward this objective.""

Party sets course in document,"Socialism with Chinese characteristics, 'one country, two systems' mapped out
A political document that was recently approved in a Party meeting maps out the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and includes the principle of ""one country, two systems"" as a major part of China's system of governance and an institutional advantage.
The 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China approved a decision on major issues concerning how to uphold and improve socialism with Chinese characteristics and to advance the modernization of China's system and capacity for governance at its fourth plenary session in Beijing last month.
The ""one country, two systems"" principle, the document said, is an important means for the Party to lead the people in realizing the peaceful reunification of the country, and it is a great initiative of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
""It is the 'one country, two systems' principle seen in a new light as one of the significant advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, which shows its importance in the system of Chinese socialism and the governance system,"" said Li Zhenguang, a professor at the Institute of Taiwan Studies at Beijing Union University.
""One country, two systems"" means there is only one China under which the mainland adheres to the socialist system while Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan may retain their capitalist systems. The State policy was a design by the CPC that has been applied in Hong Kong and Macao since China resumed exercising sovereignty over the two special administrative regions, respectively in 1997 and 1999.
Zhang Xiaoming, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, recently said in an explanatory article that the facts have shown that the principle is the best systemic arrangement for Hong Kong and Macao to maintain long-term prosperity and stability, and, like any new thing, it needs to be examined in practice and constantly improved.
Zhang said the powers of the central government, as stipulated in the law, include the interpretation of the Basic Law and the right to declare the SARs as being in a state of war or emergency, and the exercise of these powers must be institutionalized, standardized and procedural.
Meanwhile, the document said, the legal system and enforcement mechanism of the SARs for safeguarding national security should be established and improved, indicating it has not been fully worked out.
Safeguarding national security is the core requirement for implementing the principle and the constitutional responsibility of the SARs, Zhang said, ""It is natural, and there are also practical needs.""
As violence continues to increase in Hong Kong, with anti-government protests entering a sixth month, the city saw radicals openly advocating ""Hong Kong independence"" and actively engaging with foreign political forces.
Zhang said the absence of local legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law and related executive bodies in Hong Kong has given rise to the emergence of local radical separatist forces, which have become more active in recent years.
Under Article 23, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region must enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition and subversion against the government of the People's Republic of China.
The Macao Special Administrative Region enacted legislation under Article 23 in 2009 and set up a local commission to safeguard national security last year.
Zhang said there is a ""pressing need"" for the HKSAR to safeguard national security through local legislation and law enforcement.
The requirements of the document to establish a sound legal system and enforcement mechanism indicated that the central leadership has been concerned about the HKSAR's recent unrest in which the acts of some radicals have already jeopardized national security, said Gu Minkang, a member of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, China's leading Hong Kong affairs think tank.
There is a legal vacuum on national security in Hong Kong, and the HKSAR government and people of Hong Kong have the responsibility to continue to push forward the legislation, he said.
Lawrence Ma Yan-kwok, chairman of the Hong Kong Legal Exchange Foundation, said to establish a sound legal system and enforcement mechanism requires legal experts to do more research on how the city can enact the law and how to enforce the law after the legislation.
Based on the experience gained through the practice of ""one country, two systems"", the document designed guidelines on how to further improve and promote the practice.
""The document is unprecedented in the history of the Party, which shows the central leadership's resolution in adhering to the principle and its confidence in better governing the two SARs,"" Zhang said in his article. ""How to run Hong Kong and Macao, which adopt the capitalist system under the principle, has been and will be a major task for the CPC in its governance for a long time.""
China will improve mechanisms for integrating Hong Kong and Macao into the overall national development, realizing complementary advantages, according to the document.
""Integration is needed for the country's reform and opening-up, and also an inevitable choice if Hong Kong and Macao are to develop themselves,"" Zhang said.
Hong Kong's development encountered some difficulties, including a shortage of housing and land supply, and a wide gap between the rich and the poor. Macao also saw problems in developing a more diversified economy, which it cannot solve on its own, he said.
""People in Hong Kong and Macao should actively integrate into the overall development of the country, and the central leadership will also further improve the mechanism for them,"" he added.
Li, the Taiwan studies professor, said upholding and improving the ""one country, two systems"" principle will also be a key to deal with the Taiwan issue, which will help to steadily advance the peaceful reunification of the country.
Institutional arrangements for peaceful development will be reached with Taiwan. After the peaceful reunification, the island's social system and lifestyle of the people will be maintained, the document said.
Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, said the mainland will consider the actual needs of people at the grassroots level on the island and continue to deepen the integration of the two sides and develop institutional arrangements and policy measures to ensure the well-being of Taiwan compatriots.
The mainland will continue to treat Taiwan residents who live on the mainland the same as it does to local people and will share the mainland's development opportunities with them, he said.

Beijing says no links between HK violence and freedom of speech,"The Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday the extreme, violent incidents that happened in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region over the weekend had nothing to do with freedom of speech or assembly, but are unlawful acts that challenge the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
Hua Chunying, ministry spokeswoman and director-general of its Information Department, made the remark a day after the United States Department of State expressed concern over recent protests in Hong Kong and urged the SAR government to respect people's freedom of speech and assembly.
In the ministry's daily news conference in Beijing, Hua stressed that the unlawful acts in Hong Kong have undermined the city's rule of law and violated the SAR's Basic Law and other local laws.
She said that the central government supports the SAR government in exercising law-based governance and supports the police in bringing offenders to justice in accordance with the laws to safeguard Hong Kong's law and order.
Hua said that people from various sectors in Hong Kong have peacefully assembled to denounce violent acts. The central government believes most Hong Kong residents have a clear understanding of the nature of and hazards presented by radical protesters' violent and unlawful acts for the community.
She reiterated that the HKSAR is part of China, and the country firmly opposes any foreign intervention in the SAR's affairs, referring to foreign countries' false remarks and allegedly secret manipulation by the US behind the city's recent protests.
On Sunday, Hong Kong saw violent incidents in two separate locations following a peaceful protest against the now-suspended extradition law amendments. Radical protesters besieged the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR. They defaced the national emblem mounted at the entrance and sprayed offensive graffiti on the outer wall.
Later that night, a group of men indiscriminately attacked protesters, journalists and passersby in Yuen Long, a densely populated area in the northwestern New Territories, leaving 45 people injured. At least six were arrested.
Also on Tuesday, a spokesman for the ministry's Office of the Commissioner in the HKSAR expressed firm opposition to ""false remarks"", urging the United States to immediately stop sending out wrong signals on violent and illegal acts in Hong Kong.
The spokesman stated that it is widely recognized that the ""one country, two systems"" principle has been faithfully implemented since the return of Hong Kong, and that people of Hong Kong enjoy unprecedentedly extensive democratic rights and freedoms in accordance with the law.
The US accusation of ""erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy"" is a biased and groundless smear attempt driven by political motives, the spokesman said.

Foreign media 'confused' Hong Kong situation,"A senior Singaporean government official said international news media outlets have presented a ""confused, muddied"" picture of the situation in Hong Kong with ""superficial analyses"", and Singapore is not benefiting from troubles in China's special administrative region.
""If you look at it internationally, outsiders looking in, I think a confused, muddied picture has been presented because international news organizations have dealt with very superficial analyses, and engaged in labeling,"" Minister for Law and Home Affairs K. Shanmugam told Hong Kong's South China Morning Post and Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao.
The ongoing unrest has led to reports that some wealthy businesspeople based in Hong Kong have begun moving their assets overseas, and Singapore was a beneficiary, the South China Morning Post reported.
But Shanmugam said he did not believe that Singapore was benefiting from the turmoil in Hong Kong.
""We benefit from stability across the region, including Hong Kong,"" he said. ""If China does well, Hong Kong does well, the region does well, we do well.""
Shanmugam also said that China's system selects competent, good people in the government, and that not enough credit is given to China's major achievement of lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty over the past three decades.
""No country has done that in history, in 35 years,"" he said. ""Could that have been achieved under any of the other systems? The Chinese leaders will also ask you about the well-being of the people in China. Is there a system, a political system that can do better for the people of China, compared to the current system?""
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea also expressed its support for China over its handling of the ongoing protests in Hong Kong.
""It is our principled stand that any country, entity and individual should not be allowed to destroy the sovereignty and security of China and 'one country, two systems' as Hong Kong is Hong Kong of China,"" a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Sunday, the official Korean Central News Agency reported.

HK residents cherish peace and order,"An opinion poll held during a major rally held in Hong Kong last weekend showed most participants hoped that the city's police would strengthen law enforcement and restore its peace and order, the rally's organizer and pollster local think tank PolitiHK Social Strategic said on Thursday.
The think tank said the rally's participants called for stricter law enforcement by the police and an investigation into the rioters' legal liability in the series of anti-extradition bill protests in the past two months.
The results also indicated that the organizers of those violent demonstrations should be held accountable for the damage made to public facilities and pay for the losses incurred, as they have allowed the protests to turn violent and disruptive.
""We collected and summarized those opinions so that different voices of Hong Kong people can be heard,"" said Innes Tang Tak-shing, chairman of PolitiHK Social Strategic. Those demands were collected through various channels, including on-site polls and online platforms, he added.
The think tank has organized two mass assemblies to support the police. They were attended by 165,000 and 90,000 people on June 30 and Aug 3, respectively.
Also on Thursday, more than 100 people attended a rally at Tsim Sha Tsui Star Ferry Pier to pay respect to the national flag.
The rally was held in response to a series of violent protests that have seen the national flag desecrated and national dignity undermined. A spokesman for the organizers of the rally said the ""one country, two systems"" principle is now facing its biggest challenge in two decades as black-clad protesters tossed the national flag into the sea twice and blatantly defaced the national emblem.
Calling them ""extremely arrogant and unscrupulous rioters"", the spokesman added, ""What awaits them will be heavy legal liabilities and indelible shame in history.""
According to the National Flag and National Emblem Ordinance of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, ""a person who desecrates the national flag or national emblem by publicly and willfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling on it"" commits an offense and is liable on conviction to a fine and imprisonment for three years.
At the rally, a 70-year-old retired public school teacher, surnamed Cheung, who brought his two grandchildren, said: ""I want to send the message that Hong Kong is part of China and we should all cherish peace and order.""
A businessman, surnamed Wong, delayed his regular commute between Hong Kong and Shenzhen to attend the rally. ""Radical acts are intolerable. The police should be resolute in enforcing the law,"" he said.

Mainland authority: Taiwan losing 'ties' a trend,"The Taiwan affairs authority of the mainland said on Wednesday that it's a trend that more countries will build diplomatic ties with the Chinese mainland, after two Pacific nations decided to switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing based on the one-China principle.
Last week, the Solomon Islands severed official ties with Taiwan and established diplomatic relations with the mainland. Kiribati also announced plans it would resume ties with the mainland. So far, 179 countries have diplomatic ties with the Chinese mainland.
The Taiwan authority said recently that it will consider increasing aid for countries with ""diplomatic ties"" with the island including Nauru, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Palau to ensure stable relationships.
Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, said the move by the Taiwan authority shows who is engaged in ""money diplomacy"".
""Adhering to the one-China principle is the trend of history, which is unstoppable. More countries choose to establish diplomatic relations with us, and this trend will continue,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Ma also condemned the United States' obstruction of the Solomon Islands' move to cut ""ties"" with the island and its support for Taiwan in defending its international space.
""The Taiwan question is China's internal affair,"" he said. ""The US should abide by the one-China principle and properly handle Taiwan-related issues.""
The Democratic Progress Party, the ruling party of the island, and some Taiwan organizations will organize a public parade this month in Taiwan to support the protests in Hong Kong, the island media reported.
In response, Ma said, ""It is more proof of the DPP's meddling in Hong Kong affairs and their attempt to destabilize Hong Kong.""
""The DPP authorities and 'Taiwan independence' forces, for their own benefit, have ignored the welfare of the people of Hong Kong and Taiwan and added fuel to the flames.""
In the past three months, radical demonstrations and violent attacks in Hong Kong have seriously undermined the city's prosperity and stability, challenged the rule of law and social order and violated the bottom line of the principle of ""one country, two systems"".
A few activists continue to carry out violent activities and even openly advocate ""Hong Kong independence"", arousing the strong indignation of Chinese people at home and abroad, Ma said.
At present, ""stop violence and restore order"" has become the most extensive consensus of all sectors of Hong Kong society, he said.
Ma warned the DPP authorities and ""Taiwan independence"" forces to stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and undermining cross-Straits relations.
""Those who start a fire will burn themselves,"" he added.

"HK in 'severe situation' with looming recession, leader says","Chief executive calls for unity to curb violence
Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor cautioned on Tuesday that the Asian financial hub is in a ""severe situation"" as it may fall into recession after months of violent protests.
To revive the troubled economy, she called on the whole city to join hands in quelling violence, which she described as the ""fundamental"" solution to solve the current crisis.
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is very likely to record negative economic growth for 2019, Lam told the media before the weekly Executive Council meeting.
In mid-August, the SAR government lowered the city's expected economic growth from 2 to 3 percent to 0 to 1 percent due to a ""remarkably increasing risk of recession"".
Hong Kong's economy recorded negative quarter-on-quarter growth in the second quarter. If the economy continued to contract in the third quarter, it would indicate that the city's economy is technically heading into recession, Lam said. Relative data from the third quarter is expected to be announced on Thursday.
The city's Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po revealed over the weekend that, according to statistics on hand, the economy continued to contract in the third quarter, and the extent of contraction was magnified.
To boost the economy, Lam said, the government would announce fresh measures, including strengthening overseas promotion and connections with the Chinese mainland once the unrest in the city settles.
She also pledged that the government will offer continuous support to enterprises and residents affected by the economic slump.
Since August, three rounds of relief measures of more than HK$20 billion have been rolled out, covering sectors bearing the brunt of the social unrest such as retail, catering, transport and tourism.
Some of the measures required additional resources, leading the government to seek more funding from the Finance Committee of the Legislative Council.
Considering the large backlog the committee was already facing, Lam called for cross-spectrum cooperation from lawmakers so that livelihood-related bills could be passed as soon as possible.
However, Lam emphasized that the above initiatives to boost the economy were just a bandage. The fundamental solution to the current unrest is still to end violence and restore order, she added.
Noting that achieving that goal requires unified support, she appealed to the public to not condone violence and give more support to the government and the police.
Also on Tuesday, the door closed on high-profile activist Joshua Wong Chi-fung's aspirations to run for district councilor in Hong Kong after an electoral officer ruled that his nomination for the 2019 District Council Ordinary Election was invalid.
Wong is the only candidate disqualified from the city's 6th district council election scheduled on Nov 24.
In a notice to Wong, the returning officer said the decision was based on Wong's public remarks and his reply to the officer's inquiry that he does not intend to safeguard the Basic Law, the SAR's constitutional document, nor pledge allegiance to the SAR.
Wong is the founder and secretary-general of the Demosisto, a local group that aims to achieve self-determination in Hong Kong.
The officer pointed out that according to public information, the group has always agreed that the SAR's independence from China is a possible option for self-determination, which contradicts the Basic Law.
In a statement issued shortly afterward, the SAR government said it supports the decision.
Changing the HKSAR system by supporting Hong Kong independence as an option for self-determination is inconsistent with the constitutional and legal status of the HKSAR as stipulated in the Basic Law, as well as the country's established basic policies regarding Hong Kong, the government said in the statement.
""The candidate cannot possibly comply with the requirements of the relevant electoral laws since advocating or promoting 'self-determination' is contrary to the declaration that the law requires a candidate to make - to uphold the Basic Law and pledge allegiance to the HKSAR.""

"US puppets, that's what's happening","One of the things that has made social media so popular is that every user can independently operate social media accounts and become so-called self-media, which was unimaginable when large media organizations had control of the information channels. And in the social media age although people's points of view might not be popular, their right to air them is protected and respected, as long as they are not harmful to others or society as a whole.
At least that is what you might think. But even in the self-media age, the platforms are still controlled by big organizations, and it seems that you had better shut up if your views are not to their liking. Although they claim to have difficulty shutting down illegal violence inciting race-hate posts, Twitter and Facebook have had no difficulty shutting down some accounts they claim are spreading disinformation about the ""protests"" in Hong Kong, claiming these accounts are tied to the Chinese government.
Without providing any tangible evidence, the two companies assert the Chinese government is behind the fake accounts. If accounts expressing views similar to those of a government are to be regarded as being paid by the government, then the US government is surely their largest sponsor of fake accounts. Their claim is ludicrous and irresponsible.
The platforms have tried to claim the moral high ground and abuse their monopoly positions to control information and stifle freedom of speech. That is exactly what's happening with the move by the two US companies, which are saying ""Shut up! We are supporting freedom and democracy"".
The truth is the ""protests"" in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region that involve Western agitators are now in their 11th week, and they have long been derailed from the track of peaceful demonstrations.
The rioters openly challenge China's sovereignty in the SAR and are pushing the city into an anarchic state. Hong Kong's economy is seriously affected, public order damaged and rule of law undermined. No sovereign state would brook such an open challenge. That both Beijing and the SAR government have acted with great restraint in dealing with the unrest has won broad recognition.
It is suggested the two companies reflect on their inglorious record of being accomplices of the US government in inciting ""revolutions"" around the world to install puppet regimes in the name of the people.

Blatant anti-China bias of Western media,"A TOTAL OF 93 EXTINCTION REBELLION PROTESTERS WERE ARRESTED for pouring fake blood on Wall Street's famous ""Charging Bull"" statue. China Daily writer Zhang Zhouxiang comments:
According to reports the protesters were not arrested until they blocked access for tourists.
Western media outlets covering the issue interviewed not only the protesters and tourists at the site, they also quoted the New York Police Department in order to provide balanced reports that had neutral headlines.
Such reporting was also seen during the Yellow Vests protest in France. Do a search on the internet and you find all kinds of media reports about the rioting that are balanced and objective.
Yet when it comes to violence in Hong Kong it is completely different. The keywords in the reports from the same media outlets are ""police brutality"" and ""shocked by the police"", with all the quotes coming from the demonstrators, some of which openly advocate separatism, which is illegal in China.
When a demonstration happens in the West that disturbs public order, the police are described as doing what their jobs require them to do. When a similar incident happens in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region it is transformed into ""fight for freedom"" and the police actions are ""brutality"".
Why not call the Yellow Vest protesters in France ""freedom fighters""? Or the Extinction Rebellion protesters in New York?
The distorted reporting on the rioting in Hong Kong is symptomatic of much of the Western media's bias against China.
The Hong Kong police are as professional as their Western counterparts. The Western media should demonstrate the same professionalism when reporting on what is happening in Hong Kong and other issues relating to China.

NBA exec's tweet over HK denounced,"Chinese basketball fans and organizations have taken a strong stance against Houston Rockets executive Daryl Morey's tweet backing protests in Hong Kong, which have grown increasingly violent.
With only days before the NBA tips off an overseas preseason game tour in Shanghai, Morey, the Rockets' general manager, infuriated Chinese fans by tweeting support for the protests in Hong Kong, which have led to vandalism and serious damage. The tweet has sparked criticism beyond the sport's circles in China and triggered related organizations to cut ties with the franchise.
During the Rockets' preseason trip to Japan on Friday, Morey tweeted an image that read ""Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong"".
That was a slogan often shouted by rioters during months of protests in Hong Kong, which were sparked by opposition to a bill to amend the special administrative region's extradition law.
Morey deleted the post after Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta distanced his organization from its GM's opinion, saying on Twitter that Morey doesn't speak for the Rockets. The team has had longstanding support in China for being the home of basketball Hall of Fame inductee Yao Ming from 2002 to 2011. Fertitta, however, later told ESPN that ""everything is fine with Daryl and me"".
The Chinese Basketball Association, now chaired by Yao, swiftly responded on Sunday, announcing it had suspended any exchange or cooperation with the Rockets and expressing ""strong opposition"" to Morey's ""improper remarks regarding Hong Kong"". The Chinese league has also canceled its four preseason games against NBA development league teams, including Rockets' affiliate Rio Grande Valley Vipers, originally set for Oct 19 and 20 in Suzhou, Jiangsu province.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston issued a statement saying it was ""deeply shocked"" by Morey's ""erroneous comments"" and expressed ""strong dissatisfaction"". The consulate also urged the Rockets to ""correct the error and take immediate concrete measures to eliminate the adverse impact"".
Both China Central Television and the league's digital partner Tencent have announced a suspension of all broadcasting, livestreaming and news coverage of the Rockets, one of the most-followed NBA franchises in China, blocking it in its biggest overseas market.
The NBA, preparing for its preseason games between Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets in Shanghai on Thursday and Shenzhen two days later, issued a statement on Monday through Mike Bass, its chief communications officer. Bass said the league understands Morey's views had ""deeply offended many"" in China, ""which is regrettable"".
""We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides,"" the statement said.
On Monday, Morey tweeted trying to clarify his original post.
""I did not intend my tweet to cause offense,"" Morey said. ""I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives."" He also said, ""My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.""
Rockets star guard James Harden apologized to Chinese fans after practice in Tokyo. ""We apologize. We love China,"" he said, standing alongside fellow All-Star teammate Russell Westbrook.
Joseph Tsai, co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, who also owns the Nets, urged the league to learn its lesson on better understanding the history of China because repairing a hurt takes a long time.
""The one thing that is terribly misunderstood and often ignored is that 1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country's sovereignty over her homeland. This issue is nonnegotiable,"" the Chinese-Canadian entrepreneur wrote in an open letter posted on social media.

Anti-mask law does not violate human rights,"According to Hong Kong's Public Order Ordinance protesters can be prosecuted for unlawful assembly if they conduct themselves in a disorderly, intimidating, insulting or provocative manner intended to or likely to commit a breach of the peace. It is immaterial that the original assembly is lawful if being assembled they conduct themselves in such a manner, as they will then be guilty of unlawful assembly.
The Ordinance also states that any person taking part in an unlawful assembly who commits a breach of the peace is guilty of rioting.
However, the two offences require a high standard of evidence for conviction. A number of individuals have been arrested during the protests on these charges, but the Department of Justice has chosen not to prosecute due to insufficient evidence.
The ""anti-mask"" law that took effect on Oct 5, when the chief executive invoked the Emergency Regulations Ordinance for the first time in 52 years to make new regulations, introduces an absolute liability offence which prohibits the wearing of facial coverings during demonstrations that are likely to prevent identification. The ban applies regardless of the legal status of the assemblies, and anyone judged not to have a reasonable excuse or exemption for wearing a mask faces arrest and prosecution.
Although a person who commits an offence under the ""anti-mask"" law is only liable to imprisonment for one year, which is a relatively lenient criminal punishment compared to imprisonment of up to three years for the crime of unlawful assembly and imprisonment of up to 10 years for the crime of rioting, investigation, prosecution and conviction under the ""anti-mask law"" may take only a few months to complete instead of up to a year for offences under the Public Order Ordinance. Efficiency can be more effective than harsh punishment in terms of the law's deterrence effect.
It remains to be seen whether the new regulation can bring order back to the city, but simply criticizing it as a contravention of the current legal protections of rights and freedoms in the special administrative region is groundless.
Emboldened by anonymity, some radical protestors have not only wantonly destroyed public and private property, but also brutally attacked civilians and police officers, in some instances putting their victims lives at risk.
On the weekend, a police officer's neck was slashed and Hong Kong police said a homemade remote-controlled explosive device intended to ""kill or to harm"" police officers was detonated during the violent protests across the territory on Sunday.
It is the current situation in Hong Kong that made the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation necessary. As Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has said, Hong Kong is now ""in rather extensive and serious public danger. It is essential for us to stop the violence and restore calmness in society"".
Moreover, the new regulation only prohibits people from using face coverings to prevent identification at protests and assemblies. It does not deprive people of the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, as people can still participate in lawful assemblies and express their views in a peaceful manner. Hong Kong Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah said the prohibition on face covering is proportionate to the legitimate aim of protecting public safety and public order.
The social unrest in Hong Kong has lasted for more than four months, with the territory experiencing the worst mayhem since riots in 1967. The government has a legal and moral duty to adopt all available legal measures to stop the escalating violence and restore order.
However, the Hong Kong government should understand that the current chaos stems fundamentally from local socio-economic problems. There is no way these underlying problems can be resolved on the streets, or by law enforcement alone. The government must continue to work with different sectors of society and improve its communication with the public.
In the meantime, the introduction of the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation is an important measure to put an end to the violence and restore order.

21 HK officers hurt in weekend protests,"Twenty-one officers were injured in Hong Kong over the weekend when they were attacked by violent protesters, said Kong Wing-cheung, senior superintendent of police, who spoke at a news conference in Hong Kong on Monday afternoon.
They were bloodied in assaults by protesters mainly using bricks and iron bars. Also, 86 of the protesters were detained over the weekend, police said.
In the most severe case, a protester thrust a sharpened iron rod and wounded a police officer in the back when he was inside a police vehicle on Sunday, said Tse Chun-chung, chief superintendent of the police public relations branch.
Sunday's protests took place in Tsuen Wan and nearby areas. But some extremely violent protesters deviated from the original routes, obstructing roads, vandalizing shops and facilities and attacking officers, police said.
Video footage posted online showed the protesters using iron poles, sharpened metal rods and umbrellas to attack the officers, who were assigned to handle reports of vandalism at shops in the area.
Retreating, the officers held up shields to protect themselves. A warning shot was fired when one officer fell to the ground while retreating. Officials said it was the first time police had fired a warning shot since protests against the shelved extradition amendment bill broke out in mid-June.
The officer who fired his service revolver exercised great restraint, and his use of force was necessary and reasonable, said Mak Chin-ho, assistant commissioner of police operations, saying the officer was facing a ""life-or-death"" situation and his decision to fire was in self-defense.
Protesters had shown ""a clear intention to take the life"" of the officer who fell to the ground, Mak said. Firing a shot in the air was a warning to keep things from worsening, Mak said.
At a government interdepartmental news conference on Monday, Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung condemned the escalating protests, which ""showed a total disregard for law and order"".
Cheung also extended gratitude and support to police for enforcing laws, calling it ""the most solid defense"" of Hong Kong's security.
""It was one horrible night,"" said Lee Wing, a retired carpenter who spent most of his 60 years in Tsuen Wan. ""In the old days, my parents would not let me out at night because mobsters might fight. Now I have to do the same with my kids.""

London Stock Exchange votes against HK protests,"Editor's Note: London Stock Exchange has formally rejected a 32 billion pound ($40 billion) takeover bid by Hong Kong Stock Exchange citing ""business concerns"" just a few days after the latter made the proposal. People's Daily comments:
In a statement to the stock market, the LSE said, ""the board unanimously rejects the conditional proposal and, given its fundamental flaws, sees no merit in further engagement"", adding that it does not believe that the HKEX offers it the best long-term positioning in Asia or the best listing/trading platform in China.
It also said that it values mutually beneficial partnership with Shanghai Stock Exchange, which is its preferred direct channel to opportunities in China.
The LSE's view may not reflect the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's status as a global financial hub, but it is enough to send ripples across Hong Kong's financial community. Both cities have played vitally important roles in China's rise. And which of the two has better development prospects largely depends on which one better fits in with the country's overall development interests.
The LSE thinks Shanghai offers it the best long-term positioning in Asia because it believes Shanghai is 100 percent aligned with the country's interests.
But when it comes to Hong Kong, the three-month-long violent demonstrations have raised the concerns of economic entities even other countries about the city's future.
Some in Hong Kong's financial community naively assume that street violence will only affect Hong Kong's tourism and hospitality industries without harming its finance and trade sectors. The LSE's rejection of the HKEX's deal has proved them wrong.
As one of the freest economies in the world, Hong Kong is not only irreplaceable for China, but also needs to grow stronger. That explains why in the proposed Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, Hong Kong is regarded as the core engine of regional development.
Yet some in Hong Kong still hold a passive attitude toward the SAR's integration with the country's overall development plan. This is not only economic myopia but also political prejudice."
Unrest has 'detrimental effect' on HK economy,"The central government and all walks of life in Hong Kong are worried that social unrest in the city is starting to take its toll on its economy.
Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said violent clashes between the police and protesters have affected the city's economy, harming tourism and retail sales.
""The political protests began in June and have had a detrimental effect on Hong Kong's economy and even dampened overseas investors' confidence in Hong Kong,"" Yang said at a news conference on Tuesday.
He added that flights in and out of Hong Kong, railway operations and traffic on major roadways in the city were all affected by the general strike on Monday.
Yang's remarks came after Hong Kong's top financial official warned that the city's economy faces the prospect of a ""technical recession period"" in the third quarter of this year.
Hong Kong's economic output in the second quarter increased 0.6 percent year-on-year, according to its Census and Statistics Department.
""Hong Kong's economic environment became more challenging in July, and if there are job layoffs due to the economic downturn, this will affect the livelihood of many Hong Kong residents,"" Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said on Wednesday.
He said the government will consider measures to support Hong Kong's small and medium-sized enterprises and boost employment in terms of facilitating capital turnover, slashing operational costs and exploring overseas markets.
""We will also consider launching measures that can alleviate the financial burdens of the city's residents,"" Chan added.
Hong Kong's tourism and retail industries are feeling the pinch as a result of the recent political protests.
The Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, the city's listed enterprise that operates the Peninsula Hotel brand, cautioned that political uncertainty in Hong Kong could jeopardize its business performance and the hotel operator is monitoring how the protests affect visitor arrivals and Hong Kong's economic stability.
Wharf Real Estate Investment Co, the retail property arm of Hong Kong's listed developer Wheelock and Co, said the prospects for business performance in the second half of the year were not optimistic.
""The retail industry of Hong Kong is facing a perfect storm with external and internal factors affecting the whole sector. We may face greater challenges than ever this year,"" Wharf Real Estate Investment Co Chairman and Managing Director Stephen Ng Tin-hoi said on Tuesday.
Retail sales in Hong Kong declined 6.7 percent year-on-year in June, falling for the fifth consecutive month, amid the anti-extradition bill protests, which have harmed consumer sentiment. According to Hong Kong's financial secretary, inbound tourism has created more than 220,000 jobs in the retail, catering and hospitality industries.
""In fact, if the current protests in Hong Kong and the trade dispute between the United States and China continue, this year's retail sales could decline by more than the 3.7 percent in 2015, during the anti-corruption campaign on the Chinese mainland,"" said Stephanie Lau, a Moody's vice-president and senior analyst.

Reporter beaten at airport said he still loves HK,"Fu Guohao, a Global Times website reporter who was illegally detained, restrained with plastic zip ties, verbally abused and beaten by protesters at the Hong Kong International Airport on Tuesday, was discharged from a Hong Kong hospital at noon on Wednesday.
Fu spoke to the media after his discharge from Princess Margaret Hospital in the New Territories of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Though he had some bruises on his face, Fu said he did not suffer serious injury.
Fu thanked the public for their care and concern and said he still loves Hong Kong.
Fu was dispatched by Beijing-based Global Times to cover the mass protests in Hong Kong. The sit-in at the airport that started on Friday virtually paralyzed the operations of the international airport for two days.
Fu, who had been wearing a yellow press vest, had his arms and legs restrained with plastic ties for almost an hour and also had flashlights shined in his eyes. A video of the incident, widely circulated online, shows those that detained him asked him for his press credentials, accused him of being a fake journalist, stripped him of his vest and searched his bags.
While tied up and surrounded by the group, Fu shouted: ""I support Hong Kong police. You can beat me now.""
Medics managed to free Fu, but the protesters continued to beat him as he was being taken to an ambulance, the video shows.
The incident led to expressions of shock from around the country. Shortly after Fu was detained and beaten, Global Times Editor-in-Chief Hu Xijin confirmed on his Weibo account that Fu is a reporter for the media organization.
Hu said the attack on the reporter was ""shameless"" and ""cowardly"". He urged protesters, who he called ""mobs"", to exercise the most basic principle of respect and refrain from hurting journalists.
""If these radical protesters in Hong Kong can conduct a brutal persecution of journalists, then you tell me, should we stop calling you mobs, but instead 'terrorists'?"" Hu said.
On Wednesday, the All-China Journalists Association strongly condemned the attack on Fu. The association expressed its deepest sympathy and highest respect for the reporter.
It said journalists' personal rights and rights to exercise their profession should not be violated by any means. The brutal attack and illegal detention of the reporter by rioters caused injuries and were violent crimes, it said. The acts violate the legitimate rights and interests of journalists, challenge and insult the global media and trample on press freedom, the association said.
The association said it will work to firmly safeguard the rights of journalists to conduct interviews and it strongly supports them in conducting normal reporting activities. It also urged relevant parties to severely punish those who endanger journalists' safety and their right to work.
In a letter to Global Times' Hu, the Hong Kong Association of Media Veterans condemned what happened to Fu. The association, with a membership of more than 1,000 media workers, said Fu has shown the world how to be a professional reporter.
The Hong Kong Federation of Journalists also expressed its strong condemnation of the incident, calling such atrocious acts unacceptable, especially at the city's airport, a highly visible location used by international travelers.
The Newspaper Society of Hong Kong said it is ""deeply concerned that many reporters have been victimized while covering mass rallies in recent months"", including being subject to ""insults and attacks to having their reporting activities disrupted"". It said the situation, as shown by what happened at the airport, is getting worse by the day.
The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong said what the protesters did to Fu was brutal and reckless. It tainted Hong Kong's reputation in the international community, the city's largest political party said in a statement.
The Federation of Trade Unions, the city's largest union, also denounced the incident, saying that what the rioters did was lawless and in defiance of the city's rule of law, morality and ethics.

Travel warnings display US hypocrisy,"The United States issued an advisory on Wednesday warning US citizens traveling to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region about their personal safety in view of the ongoing demonstrations, which have turned increasingly nasty.
The move is not only an attempt to inflict further damage on the city's economy already seriously troubled by the disturbances. It is also a blatant example of US hypocrisy, since the trouble makers have been receiving leadership and support from it.
The US diplomatic corps in the SAR has not even bothered to conceal its attempts to meddle in the SAR's affairs. The Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the SAR complained to senior officials of the US Consulate General in Hong Kong and Macao on Thursday about their contacting Hong Kong separatist leaders.
More important, US leaders such as Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have given their blessings more than once to the demonstrators over the past two months, and congressional leaders obsessed with demonizing and antagonizing China have been pushing for politically motivated legislation to encourage the insurrectionists in Hong Kong.
That the US knows the demonstrators are acting illegally is clearly revealed in the advisory, which states the protests and confrontations have spilled over into neighborhoods other than those where the police have permitted marches or rallies.
For US politicians to be endorsing and advocating unlawful and violent behavior in another country is unfortunately now the norm, but that does not make it any less nefarious in design and nature.
Since the storming of the Legislative Council Complex in June, acts of violence have taken place in almost all popular tourist spots and busy shopping districts, scaring away foreign visitors and local consumers alike. The latest figures show a marked drop in the number of visitors, hotel occupancy and retail business spraying salt on the SAR's faltering economy.
The demonstrators are certainly aware of the consequences of their lawbreaking as they have been handing out pamphlets to tourists ahead of planned demonstrations at the airport, requesting they be excused for creating ""a broken, torn-apart city"".
No doubt an economic and governance crisis in the city is what the masterminds have hoped to cause as a result of the violent protests and the US-China trade conflict.
However, the central government has reiterated its determination to help the SAR government restore law and order in the city. It will not allow the unrest to continue."
"Western media, politicians have HK double standards","China said on Monday that the double standards practiced by Western politicians and media toward violence in Hong Kong compared with unrest in Catalonia and London will only end up hurting all parties.
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying made the remark at a daily news briefing when commenting on Western criticism of the violent protests in the latter two locations compared to a lack of condemnation of the violent protests in Hong Kong.
Hua said that what is happening in Catalonia and London are the domestic affairs of Spain and the United Kingdom, adding that she hopes relevant issues will be properly handled under the framework of the laws and regulations of relevant countries.
Barcelona has been hit by a week of sometimes violent protests following the jailing last week of nine Catalan separatists found guilty of sedition as leaders of a failed 2017 independence drive, Reuters reported.
Some Catalan activists have used tactics similar to those of Hong Kong protesters such as cutting off major roads and gathering at the airport, resulting in dozens of flight cancellations.
A spokesman for Catalonia's regional police force said demonstrators ""sometimes"" use laser pointers against police in Barcelona, even though it is ""very uncommon here"", Agence France-Presse reported on Sunday.
While portraying what happened in Hong Kong as a pursuit of democracy and freedom, Western politicians and media have viewed the protests in Western countries as constituting violent unrest.
""This demonstrates that so-called democracy and human rights are sanctimonious pretexts for the West to meddle in Hong Kong affairs,"" Hua said.
There should be only one standard and one attitude regarding violent and criminal activities, she said, adding that double standards will only come back to bite those who practice them.

HK freedoms threatened by protesters' Xinhua rampage,"Hong Kong rioters' rampage at Xinhua News Agency's Asia-Pacific Bureau on Saturday has drawn wide criticism as an act that wantonly undermines freedom of the press.
The attack has fed into growing concern about the deliberate suppression of the city's long-cherished freedom of expression and the press sparked by rioters having targeted some media organizations in Hong Kong, as well as many innocent people, who were beaten for holding different opinions from the radicals.
In a new upwelling of violence across the city, rioters targeted the long-established national news agency bureau in downtown Hong Kong's Wan Chai area.
The rioters destroyed the office building's security facilities, set fires in front of the building and threw firebombs into the lobby. They spray-painted insulting messages on the outer walls and smashed the front gate and some of the windows.
A Xinhua spokesperson expressed the news agency's ""strong indignation with and condemnation of"" the rioters' violent acts, which showed that ""stopping violence, curbing chaos and restoring order"" are the most important and urgent tasks for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
The spokesperson urged Hong Kong police to vigorously investigate the incident.
The Hong Kong Federation of Journalists, representing some 1,000 journalists, lashed out at the targeting of Xinhua News Agency.
The vandalism amounted to an act of serious provocation of the State media agency and a wanton violation of freedom of the press in Hong Kong, the federation said.
On Sunday, the All-China Journalists Association said in a statement that the vandalism at the Xinhua bureau was a gross act of trampling on press freedom and a serious provocation to democracy and the rule of law.
The association said it will safeguard the rights and interests of news organizations and journalists, and it urged the city to punish the perpetrators of illegal acts in accordance with the law, so as to create a fair, just, free and democratic environment for the press.
Earlier, Hong Kong Television Broadcasts Ltd applied to the High Court for an interim injunction banning rioters' assaults on its employees and damage to property when its staff cover the anti-government protests.
The Hong Kong News Executives' Association issued a statement condemning the vandalizing of the Xinhua bureau, urging police to undertake strict measures to ensure the normal operation of news organizations.
Qiu Hong, deputy director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong SAR, also voiced her objection after a public event on Sunday.
Citing a commentary in People's Daily, Qiu said that unlawful conduct targeting news agencies is intolerable in any country. She expressed firm support for police containing the violence and restoring social order, and she called for the public to make concerted efforts to help restore calm.
Lau Siu-kai, vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, told China Daily that the attack on Xinhua is an escalation of the rioters' repeated acts of destruction at enterprises and organizations with strong ties to the Chinese mainland.
Recently, a number of mainland-linked bookstores, banks, and retail stores have been repeatedly vandalized during the violent protests, which have been going on for nearly five months.
Veteran Malaysian journalist Wong Chun Wai told China Daily on Sunday that the attack on the Xinhua bureau was ""unacceptable"" as it went against the very essence of democracy. ""To put it bluntly, it borders on terrorism."" Wong said.
""In any democracy, we may not agree with each other, but we must defend and uphold the right of the views of others,"" said Wong, a former chief editor of Star Media Group Berhad, a leading Malaysian news outlet.
He added that if such an incident were to occur in Malaysia, the culprits would have been swiftly identified, arrested and charged in the courts.

"476,000 show up at HK park to back police","Nearly half a million people gathered at Tamar Park in Hong Kong on Saturday afternoon, sending out a loud call for an end to the violence and radicalism that has clouded the city since mid-June.
Braving light rain, 476,000 people demanded an end to all violence and the desecration of national flags and emblems, as well as a halt to attacks on police stations and public facilities.
The participants chanted slogans while waving placards, banners and the flags of the nation and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
The city was fed up with the endless illegal marches, they said.
The rally was held after a tough week for the people of Hong Kong, with the city's aviation hub - Hong Kong International Airport - forced to cancel about 1,000 flights on Monday and Tuesday. In addition, a mainland tourist and reporter were assaulted by black-clad radicals at the airport on Tuesday night.
""Hong Kong was built up by Chinese people, not the British. And the young people here are throwing all of that away. I'm disgusted by it,"" said Erich Beck, a retired Australian who has lived in Hong Kong for 28 years.
Beck believes overseas elements are at play in the recent violent protests that have rocked the city, with the intent to ""poison Hong Kong"" in order to hurt China. He joined hundreds of thousands of local residents in an anti-violence rally on Hong Kong Island on Saturday afternoon.
Beck called on the city's young people to think rationally about their behavior.
""How are you going to make the city better if it has all been thrown away?"" he said.
The rally started at 5 pm, when people from all walks of life took the stage to share their thoughts and common wishes. They included people from the education and legal sectors, the entertainment industry and the business sector.
Tam Yiu-chung, a Hong Kong member of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, called on the participants to salute the Hong Kong police who have been fearlessly maintaining social order. His appeal drew a loud cheer of approval from the crowd.
Tam also warned those who desecrated the national flag ""not to be enemies of 1.4 billion Chinese people"". The flag and national emblem represent the dignity of the country and cannot be undermined, he said.
Maria Tam Wai-chu, deputy director of the Hong Kong SAR Basic Law Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said things that damage the overall public interest are not negotiable. For example, it's not acceptable for protesters to demand blanket amnesty for those arrested in connection with violence, she said.
The rally ended peacefully at around 6 pm.
On Sunday, anti-government protesters held a rally that moved from a packed park to a major road amid heavy rain. The HKSAR government expressed regret over the rally, at which slogans targeted the police.
Although the rally was generally peaceful, participants occupied several major roads of Hong Kong Island, severely affecting transportation and causing inconvenience to the public, a spokesperson for the government said.
The city's priority is restoring social order as soon as possible, the spokesperson said, adding that the government and members of the public will talk to restore social harmony after order returns.
Taxi driver Tso Tag-ming said he felt helpless about Sunday's situation. Blocking the main roads made it difficult to anywhere on Hong Kong Island, he said. His income yesterday was one-third of what it used to be, he said.
On Saturday, a spokesman for the country's top legislature said recent statements made by US politicians violated the spirit of the rule of law and interfered with China's internal affairs.
You Wenze, a spokesman for the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress, said some US politicians have glorified violent crimes in Hong Kong as protests for human rights and freedom, while smearing as violent suppression Hong Kong police efforts at law enforcement and maintaining social order.

Law must hold all wrongdoers in HK to account,"Editor's note: Nathan Law Kwun-chung, a main agitator behind the Hong Kong riots that are now in its 11th week, tweeted last week that he has arrived in New York, and will go to Yale University for further education. China Daily writer Li Yang comments:
Ironically, Nathan Law has called for students in Hong Kong to boycott classes when the new semester begins early next month.
Some people see his departure as a sign that the chaos in Hong Kong will recede temporarily. As two protests planned by him and his colleagues, in the tax bureau and banks of Hong Kong late last week, have been met with a cold shoulder.
Over the past few years, like Nathan Law, at least three to four major separatist leaders from Hong Kong have either served only a symbolic sentence or are still at large, despite the heavy costs they had caused to the city and the country.
In 2016, after a series of protests-turned riots came to an end, Edward Leung Tin-kei, went to Harvard University, Chou Yong Kang Alex was admitted by the London School of Economics and Political Science, and Ray Wong Toiyeung received an offer from the University of Oxford.
They are all these suspected of colluding with foreign forces and violating the Anti-Secession Law and the National Security Law, as sufficient evidence has been uncovered by various parties exposing the close relations between their scholarship and honors with branches of the US government in Hong Kong.
Given the heavy losses caused by the violence Nathan Law and his accomplices have incited, a tacit understanding seems to be forming again between the rioters and the law enforcement department of Hong Kong that the past will be left in the past. As long as the city can regain its order, all misdeeds will be forgiven.
The Basic Law and the Constitution have been seriously violated and challenged in the past 10 weeks, and the city has paid a heavy price for the chaos. If all the wrongdoers are let off the hook, the rule of law in Hong Kong will only be challenged again.
And the next time when Hong Kong falls into disorder, which is almost predictable as it has achieved nothing definite again this time so far, any outcry to stop violence will only be a new round of the-wolf-is-coming game.

HKEX stays hopeful of buying London Exchange,"The operator of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong is keeping alive the hope of taking over the London Stock Exchange, even though the 321-year-old British bourse rebuffed its $39 billion bid with a blunt letter on Friday.
Investment banks and research houses have joined in a chorus of concern over the deal, as ongoing social unrest and a geopolitical storm rock the two major financial centers.
In a strongly worded letter to the chairman and chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing - the HKEX operates the city's stock exchange and futures exchange - LSE Chairman Don Robert said the unsolicited takeover bid undervalued its business, lacked strong commercial rationale and would be difficult to implement due to scrutiny from various regulatory entities.
Citing the city's current worrying situation, Robert questioned ""Hong Kong's position as a strategic gateway to the Chinese mainland in the longer term"".
Robert made clear his preference for Shanghai over Hong Kong as a strategic partner, referring to the LSE's existing stock connect program with the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which gives it direct access to the massive Chinese mainland market.
Such an endorsement came right after China announced last week it would scrap investment quotas under the QFII and RQFII programs, allowing global traders unfettered access to the world's second-largest capital market.
The HKEX said in a statement released on Friday that it was disappointed the LSE declined to ""properly engage"" in what could be ""a highly compelling strategic opportunity"".
The HKEX said it would have more talks with LSE shareholders and refused to give up on the deal.
The HKEX would not be the first to fail in a bid to merge with the LSE, Hong Kong-based brokerage firm China Galaxy International wrote in its latest report. In 2017, a proposed merger between LSE and Deutsche Boerse AG was rejected by the European Union.
Nasdaq has made three takeover proposals and once became the largest institutional shareholder of the LSE. Euronext and Macquarie Bank also conceded defeat in their monthslong battle to buy the British bourse.
Such failures shed light on how difficult the marriage between stock exchanges could be, especially when the deal comes at a tricky time when a series of protests in Hong Kong, escalation of Sino-US trade tensions and the Brexit gridlock buffet the two cities with ""unprecedented uncertainties and challenges"", Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a report.

HK protesters now have no excuse to continue violence,"Hong Kong is expected to be free of any more violence, including rioting, now that the special administrative region's chief executive has withdrawn what was a well-intended bill to amend the extradition law.
The proposed amendment was meant to plug the legal loopholes which have for years allowed criminal suspects from other parts of the world, including those from the Chinese mainland, to evade justice by seeking shelter in the Hong Kong SAR. Such loopholes in Hong Kong's law have turned the city into a haven for fugitives, and prevented the SAR government from extraditing criminal suspects to other jurisdictions.
But despite the good intentions of the bill, the opposition camp in Hong Kong, in collusion with external forces, succeeded in painting a distorted picture of the bill to mislead Hong Kong residents, especially the younger generation, and rally support for its nefarious political designs.
Protracted demonstrations marked by frequent rioting and indiscriminate vandalism have not only dealt a heavy blow to Hong Kong's economy but also soiled the city's international image as a model of rule of law.
While the SAR government has dealt appropriately with the demonstrators and rioters, it's been open to the ideas and concerns expressed by different sectors of society.
Hong Kong SAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor's decision on Wednesday to withdraw the bill is a sincere and earnest response to the voice of the community. In fact, she had announced its suspension previously. Wednesday's move was only the completion of the formal procedure, which could be interpreted as an olive branch extended to those who have opposed the bill over the past few months.
Lam has announced fresh initiatives to start dialogues with different stakeholders of the community. She has appointed two new members to the Independent Police Complaints Council, which in turn has established a panel of international experts to assist in its work and will make its findings and recommendations public. She has also pledged to follow up the recommendations made in the IPCC's report.
Moreover, Lam has invited community leaders, professionals and academics to conduct independent studies to review the deep-seated problems in society and recommend to the government how best to solve them.
The SAR government has given a chance to Hong Kong residents to replace antagonism and confrontation with peace and dialogue. And hopefully, peace and stability will be restored in a timely manner so the city can redirect its energy and time in solving its social and economic problems."
Ban on masks a 'legal deterrent to violence',"Experts on the Chinese mainland familiar with Hong Kong legislation said a new regulation in the city that bans facial coverings at protests and assemblies is reasonable and in compliance with legislative procedure.
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, invoking the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, put the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation into effect last week after four months of violent protests and attacks in the city.
Radicals, who obstructed traffic, threatened innocent people and attacked police, protected themselves from the consequences of their crimes by wearing masks and helmets, with some even wearing gas masks.
The new regulation empowers police to stop a person wearing a mask in public and requires the removal of facial coverings. Anyone covering their face during a public meeting or illegal assembly will be held accountable for violating the ban and subject to a maximum penalty of a year's imprisonment and a fine of HK$25,000 ($3,200).
The regulation is aimed at stopping violence and helping restore social order in Hong Kong, but some people have claimed it affects people's right to protest and jeopardizes the region's autonomy.
Zou Pingxue, a professor specializing in Hong Kong's Basic Law at Shenzhen University, said the regulation sent a clear message to society that people cannot hide behind a mask, while still protecting citizens' rights to express their opinions openly and legally.
About 15 countries had enacted anti-mask laws, including the United States, Germany, France and Canada, and they had proved effective.
Zou said it was right and proper for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government to use local legal resources to restore social order.
""The ban will help reduce the level of violence and bring more people back to rationality,"" he said. ""It not only deters young people from illegal behaviors but also protects them.""
Tian Feilong, a legal expert at the ""one country, two systems"" center at Beijing's Beihang University, said the regulation was an important legal step for Hong Kong to stop violence and control disorder in accordance with the law.
""It provides a stronger legal basis and power for the police to enforce the law and also acts as a psychological and legal deterrent to criminal violence,"" he said.
Tian said the anti-mask regulation was the first administrative regulation promulgated by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government under the city's Emergency Regulations Ordinance, which empowers the chief executive to make regulations to deal with public security hazards.
""The legislative process of the new regulation is different from the routine enactment of legislation,"" Tian said. ""Simply, it took effect first and then will be subject to negative vetting. It remains valid as long as it's not rejected by over half of the lawmakers.
""It is a preliminary attempt of the SAR government to end the disorder, and if the violence continues to escalate, it can take further steps supporting police enforcement so as to provide more protection to citizens.""

Beijing slams Canberra over espionage arrest complaint,"The Foreign Ministry confirmed on Tuesday that Yang Jun, an Australian citizen, was arrested on suspicion of committing espionage.
Yang, a Chinese-born Australian, was arrested Friday by the Beijing State Security Bureau after the approval of prosecutors, ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a daily news conference.
The case is undergoing further processing as it is handled by the Chinese state security authority in accordance with the law, Geng said.
Reuters quoted Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne as saying that Yang has been held in Beijing in harsh conditions.
Yang's rights are fully guaranteed, and he is in good health, Geng said.
China is strongly dissatisfied with the statement made by Australia, he said, adding that China operates under the rule of law, and Australia should respect China's judicial sovereignty and stop interfering in the lawful handling of the case.
Also on Tuesday, China expressed strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to a statement from the G7 Summit concerning Hong Kong affairs.
The statement issued on Monday said that the G7 reaffirms the existence and importance of the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 on Hong Kong and calls for violence to be avoided.
""We have repeatedly stressed that Hong Kong's affairs are purely China's internal affairs and that no foreign government, organization or individual is entitled to intervene,"" Geng said.
Protests and violence have lasted over two months in Hong Kong, and have undermined the rule of law, order, the economy and international image of the region, he said.
No one cares more about the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong than the Chinese people, including Hong Kong residents, he said.
""We can properly deal with our own business,"" he said, urging the G7 members to stop their malicious intentions to meddle in others' affairs.
Geng underscored that the ultimate purpose and core content of the declaration is to determine that China takes back Hong Kong and resumes sovereignty over the region.
According to international laws and basic norms governing international relations, no country or organization has the right to interfere in Hong Kong affairs under the guise of the declaration, he added.

Latest vandalism in HK slammed,"Hong Kong worked on Monday to clean up debris and repair damage inflicted by protesters over the weekend.
More buildings and public property were vandalized on the city's 15th straight weekend of protests and violence.
In Admiralty district, the city's political center, protesters were televised smashing the glass perimeter of Admiralty Centre, a major office complex near the subway station, during an unauthorized public procession.
Protesters have been targeting the city's transportation facilities as they vent their fury on subway operator MTR Corp for applying for a court order to prevent vandalism and interference at its stations.
A cleaner said she and her colleagues had to clean up the scene overnight.
""I don't think they (the protesters) care,"" said a pedestrian who declined to be named.
He said that he had watched live news on TV throughout the violent incidents. ""There were so many protesters. They were so agitated that they just started smashing things,"" he said.
Admiralty has been a frequent battlefield for violent protesters and police over the past three months. Previously, mass vandalism also took place at the Legislative Council complex.
Moreover, Wan Chai station was forced to close on Sunday due to the protests. MTR staff arrived at the station at 5 am - an hour earlier than usual - to clean up the scene.
The rioters' acts have drawn widespread condemnation.
MTR strongly condemned the vandalism in a statement.
The recurrence of violence and malicious vandalism at MTR stations not only severely affected passengers' journeys but also endangered the safety of passengers and MTR staff, it said.
Saying that the cases have been reported to the police, the corporation added it will take suitable follow-up actions and reserves the right to take legal action against the parties concerned.
Stressing that society should not tolerate any violent acts disrupting law and order, the New People's Party called for anti-mask legislation as soon as possible to dissuade violent protesters by removing their anonymity.
The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, the largest political party in the legislature, stressed that the protesters' malicious acts definitely cannot be tolerated.
In a statement issued Sunday night, it reiterated its support for police to bring the rioters to justice. The party also urged all residents to immediately draw a clear line against violence and to not tolerate such extremely violent acts.
Police also severely condemned such violent acts, which ignored law and order. It said law enforcement officials will continue to take resolute actions and bring all lawbreakers to justice.
Also on Sunday, prominent medical practitioners called on the medical sector and the people of Hong Kong to save the city from the ""critical illness"" of chaos and violence and support the police in restoring law and order.
The joint statement of 600 medical professionals in the city was published in some local newspapers on Monday. ""Violence should never be glorified and encouraged,"" they said.
They also refused to be misrepresented after some other doctors and nurses in the name of the medical sector called for the government to concede to some of the demands of the protesters, including a blanket amnesty for those arrested in relation to the monthslong turmoil.

Callous condoning of HK violence,"Having been forced to temporarily shut down the airport on Monday after thousands of demonstrators swarmed the main terminal building, the Hong Kong airport authority canceled most departures on Tuesday due to a second day of protests. The disruption at the airport, a key economic artery of the international financial hub, has helped people see the true nature of their campaign.
For all the well-worded narratives, the demonstrators are trying to hold Hong Kong's prosperity and the well-being of its residents to political ransom. They have been targeting key thoroughfares, the mass transit rail system, the airport and commercial areas with the intention of disrupting economic activities. Weeks of violence have had an adverse impact on retail sales and inbound tourism, with both local consumer sentiment and visitor arrivals sagging. Some employees in the tourism sector have been reportedly forced to take unpaid leave, while business leaders have warned of potentially massive layoffs in the hospitality industry.
Worse, the violent acts of radical demonstrators have damaged Hong Kong's reputation as one of the safest cities in the world. Any further deterioration in the situation could trigger an exodus of both capital and talents, pushing the city down a path of no return, as Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, chief executive of the special administrative region, warned on Tuesday.
Every Hong Kong resident would be a loser should the city enter a permanent decline.
Of course, foreign politicians such as US Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who have an axe to grind with China, could not care less about Hong Kong's future and the well-being of its people. After all, they still have New York and London, even Zurich or Frankfurt, should Hong Kong cease to be an international financial center. To them, messing up Hong Kong is just part and parcel of containing China's rise, and any negative impacts on the lives of Hong Kong residents is just unavoidable collateral damage.
It is telling that Western critics of the SAR's efforts to maintain law and order conveniently ignore the crackdowns on the Occupy Wall Street, Extinction Rebellion and yellow vest protests in New York, London and Paris. With the world watching, law enforcers cracked down on the protesters in those places with much higher level of forces and arrested thousands of the protesters. The callous hypocrisy they display is repulsive, to say the least.
If the condoning of the violence persists, the rioters will only go to further extremes. Only by restoring stability can Hong Kong begin to repair its image and the damage done to its society and economy."
Green light for Alibaba's listing to lift confidence in HK's economy,"Chinese mainland e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd has got the go-ahead from the Hong Kong stock exchange for a secondary listing that could raise as much as $15 billion, despite almost five months of violent protests in Hong Kong that have rocked the Asian financial center and weighed on investor sentiment.
Such a move, in what could be the city's biggest listing for nine years, comes as a huge boost to the local bourse which had a tough time attracting mega deals this year. It could also stand as a well-timed confidence boost for Hong Kong.
Alibaba said in a statement on Wednesday evening that it plans to issue 500 million new ordinary shares.
Alibaba, which has already been listed on New York's Nasdaq for five years, started a weeklong investor roadshow on Wednesday. Pricing is expected to be confirmed on Nov 20 and share trading on the Hong Kong stock exchange is scheduled to begin in the week of Nov 25, according to reports by the South China Morning Post, the Hong Kong English-language newspaper owned by Alibaba.
As data from Refinitiv showed, the total value of first-time shares sales at the Hong Kong stock exchange since the middle of October is $18.5 billion, next only to Nasdaq's $23.3 billion and $21.9 billion at the New York Stock Exchange.
With the gargantuan fundraising from Alibaba, the Hong Kong stock exchange may easily secure a place among the top three in the global IPO league this year, and even retain the much-coveted title as the world's leading venue for listings for two consecutive years at the last minute.
After several quiet months of the year, Hong Kong's IPO market made a huge comeback in September. Anheuser-Busch InBev NV's $5.8 billion IPO of its Asian unit and $1.6 billion float from ESR Cayman, the largest logistics real estate operator in the Asia-Pacific region and backed by private equity giant Warburg Pincus, helped revive the sentiment in the Asia's third-largest stock exchange by market capitalization.
Like Anheuser-Busch InBev NV and ESR Cayman, Alibaba planned to list in the summer but called it off due to the long-running local violent clashes and Sino-US trade tensions that soured market sentiment.
This time, it lowered the fundraising target from the initial $20 billion and forged ahead with a share sale that would be the biggest since insurance giant AIA garnered $20.5 billion back in 2010 and one of the largest floats worldwide this year, dwarfing the IPOs of Uber, Lyft and Pinterest combined.
The e-commerce giant looks to gain momentum from record-high sales on Singles Day, the biggest shopping day on the planet, when its platform sold goods worth $38.4 billion, exceeding last year's record $30.7 billion haul.
Hong Kong lost out to New York in 2014 when Alibaba opted for a mega $25-billion IPO on Wall Street in the world's largest share sale due to the SAR's years-long ban on enterprises with different voting rights for shareholders from going public.
The ban was scrapped in April last year after the Hong Kong stock exchange launched its biggest listing reform in 25 years, a move thought to be aimed at paving the way for companies like Alibaba going public in Hong Kong.
At the time, Alibaba was valued at $168 billion. It's now one of the largest listed mainland companies with a market value exceeding $480 billion, up 175 percent from its IPO price at $68.
""For people away from home, there'll come a day when they'll begin the journey home,"" HKEX Chief Executive Charles Li Xiaojia said earlier in May, adding that the flotation should ""come as no surprise and is only a matter of time"".
On Wednesday, the bench mark Hang Seng Index dropped 1.82 percent, or 493.82 points, to finish at 26571.46 points. Alibaba closed its US trading on Wednesday morning flat at $186.97.

"Cease violence, respect rule of law, Tung says","Former HK chief calls on SAR to focus on livelihood issues amid protests
No compromise should be allowed to the ""black sheep"" in Hong Kong who were trying to disrupt and even destroy the city with violence, Tung Chee-hwa, vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, the nation's top political advisory body, said on Wednesday.
Addressing a luncheon held by Our Hong Kong Foundation, one of Hong Kong's leading think tanks, Tung, who was the first chief executive of HK, called on the city's general public to draw a clear line against violence and support the police to safeguard the dignity of the rule of law.
The SAR government would never ignore such violence as Hong Kong is a city of the rule of law, Tung said, and the government, police and judges must carry out their duties.
""Above all, all citizens must obey the law,"" Tung said.
Analyzing the reasons behind the weekslong anti-government protests, Tung said that due to the long-term impasse in livelihood issues such as housing problems and a widening income gap, some young people could not envision their future and thus choose to vent their anger through ""street politics"".
He urged the SAR government to shift its focus immediately to livelihood issues that have plagued Hong Kong for years.
""The solutions cannot be delayed any longer,"" he said.
Tung said he believed that the public should be assured that the government will carry out bold reforms to restore public confidence.
Tung also reiterated he is a firm believer of a faithful implementation of ""one country, two systems"" in Hong Kong, as well as the principle of Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy.
The recent demonstrations have proved that Hong Kong citizens' freedom of speech and assembly is guaranteed by the Basic Law, the city's constitutional document, Tung said.
However, some anti-China forces - especially those in the United States and Taiwan - took advantage of the differences between Hong Kong and the mainland's political systems to incite destruction of the SAR's relationship with the mainland, he said.
Hong Kong people should avoid being used as ""pawns"" when these forces try to use it as a base for resistance to the Chinese central government.
Also on Wednesday, 43 people charged with rioting during an illegal assembly in Hong Kong's Central and Western district on Sunday night appeared before a magistrate at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts in Sai Wan Ho.
The charges are the most serious leveled since protests against the now-suspended extradition bill began to escalate last month.
Of the defendants, a 33-year-old man was also charged with assaulting a police officer.
They were released after each paid HK$1,000($127.8) bail in cash. During and after the hearings, masked protesters gathered in the lobby of the court and shouted slogans. Hundreds of protesters also crowded the court entrance. Some of them opened umbrellas to shelter defendants from getting filmed as they stepped out of the court.
The Hong Kong police's Tuesday night announcement of the charges filed against the radical protesters arrested during the Sunday assembly swiftly sparked demonstrations, besieging police stations in Tin Shui Wai and Kwai Chung, where some of the protesters had been in custody.
Some threw umbrellas and other objects at police officers, who used pepper spray to disperse the crowd.
A total of 11 people were injured in the subsequent clashes.

Protests disrupt city's stability and operations,"The past two months have seen a series of clashes in Hong Kong between police and large numbers of protesters
Since June, Hong Kong's opposition and some radical forces have used the pretext of peaceful demonstration to engage in protests that have sometimes become violent.
Though the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government has said on many occasions that it has completely halted the amendment of two ordinances concerning the transfer of fugitives, protesters continued to escalate violence and cause mayhem in the city.
Here is a timeline of the activities that challenge the rule of law, disrupt social order, and undermine national sovereignty and the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
Challenges
The demonstrations repeatedly became violent clashes under the instigation of individuals with ulterior motives. Some repeatedly mounted attacks on police. They surrounded Hong Kong Police Headquarters, disrupted government agencies and ransacked the Legislative Council building.
¡¤ On June 9, demonstrators started to protest against the proposed amendments. In the small hours of June 10, well-organized protesters started attacking the LegCo building, blocking roads and assaulting police officers. They clashed with police, with some attempting to rob officers of their guns. Eight policemen were injured.
¡¤ On June 12, an illegal rally started around Admiralty, and some radical members stayed around the LegCo building until midnight. Well-organized protesters assaulted officers with bricks, homemade spears and even petrol bombs, injuring 22 police officers. Though police exercised restraint, the protesters continually assaulted their lines and forced police to use appropriate force to disperse demonstrators.
¡¤ On June 21, even after the HKSAR government announced that it had halted the amendments, violence continued. Extremist protesters surrounded police headquarters and wreaked havoc, and blocked the public from using services at Revenue Tower and Immigration Tower. Then they blocked Hong Kong government offices and the High Court.
¡¤ On June 26, some people instigated demonstrators to storm police headquarters for the second time. They repeated similar savage behaviors. Opposition lawmakers were once again present to provide support. The personal details of some police officers were illegally leaked online.
¡¤ On July 1, rioters blocked roads and threw corrosive liquids at police officers. They ransacked the LegCo building and assailed police with toxic chemical powder. They extensively damaged the council chamber, defaced the HKSAR regional emblem, tore up the Basic Law, waved a colonial-era flag and even called for the establishment of a so-called interim government.
Disruption
Hong Kong's social disorder worsened in July, as people assembled unlawfully or launched more demonstrations in various districts. Violence spread, affecting the normal lives of residents.
¡¤ On July 6, disputes broke out in Tuen Mun district between protesters and residents. Residents were besieged, beaten and kicked by radicals. Protesters occupied roads and besieged Tuen Mun police station.
¡¤ On July 7, protesters organized another demonstration in Kowloon, leading to a 50 percent plunge in passengers through the West Kowloon high-speed train station, compared with an average weekend. Only 31,000 passengers traveled through the station on that day. After the demonstration, some radical protesters illegally blocked roads in Tsim Sha Tsui, forcing most shops to close early.
¡¤ On July 13, a demonstration in Sheung Shui district ended with violent clashes with the police. A few radical protesters blocked main roads, beat and attacked police officers with umbrellas, iron bars, suspected toxic powders and corrosive liquids. At least 16 police officers were injured. At night, the protesters continued to sabotage stores in the district. The police then launched a clearance operation in accordance with the law.
¡¤ On July 14, some protesters removed a roadside fence in Sha Tin district to block roads, sharpened bamboo branches as weapons, and hurled bricks, umbrellas and other debris at police officers from high buildings. Fierce clashes broke out at New Town Plaza, injuring at least 10 police officers. An officer in plain clothes was attacked by a mob. Some officers were left with facial fractures. One police officer's finger was bitten off.
¡¤ On July 27, though the Hong Kong police had issued a notice of objection, some people assembled illegally in Yuen Long district. A group of radical protesters illegally cut off traffic, besieged police vehicles, smashed car windows and smeared cars with insulting words. Police officers were deployed at the village entrance to prevent conflict between protesters and villagers. Several radical protesters also besieged the Yuen Long police station, forcing the report room to suspend service. Opposition lawmakers were once again present to support the violent acts.
¡¤ On July 28, a number of radical protesters carried out illegal demonstrations in the central and western parts of Hong Kong Island, seriously hindering traffic. They dug up sidewalk slabs, destroyed street signs and lampposts, set fires on multiple roads and charged police lines. Violence escalated, as some people carried weapons such as bows and arrows and petrol bombs.
Undermining principles
A group of protesters attacked the offices of the Central Government in Hong Kong, insulted the national emblem and flag, and undermined national sovereignty and dignity and the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
¡¤ On July 21, radical protesters besieged and attacked the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government, defaced the national emblem in front of the building by hurling eggs and black paintballs, damaged security facilities and scrawled graffiti insulting the nation.
They even spoke about forming an ""interim legislature"" in a statement read out at the scene.
¡¤ On July 26, police arrested a suspect on suspicion of desecrating the national emblem.
¡¤ On July 28 and Aug 4, protesters mounted more attacks at the liaison office, but riot police stopped them
¡¤ On Aug 3 and on Aug 5, black-clad, masked protesters twice ripped the national flag off the pole in Tsim Sha Tsui and flung it into the sea, in clear defiance of national sovereignty.
Pushed to the brink
Violence and chaos escalated in August as protesters used guerrilla tactics to stage strikes, block public transportation, prevent residents from going to work, damage public facilities, besiege police stations and attack police officers across Hong Kong, pushing the city to the brink.
¡¤ On Aug 3, protesters sabotaged areas in Yau Ma Tei, Tsim Sha Tsui and Mong Kok. They blocked the Cross-Harbor Tunnel twice, paralyzing traffic between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. They charged police stations in Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok and Wong Tai Sin, scribbled words to insult and provoke the police, ruined police vehicles and started fires in front of police stations.
¡¤ On Aug 4, protesters caused considerable damage in western Hong Kong Island, Causeway Bay and Tseung Kwan O by blocking roads and attacking several police stations. They later flocked to Hung Hom to block the Cross-Harbor Tunnel and to Golden Bauhinia Square to smear the sculpture.
¡¤ On Aug 5, flash mobs stirred up trouble across Hong Kong. They destroyed public facilities, including roadside railings, sidewalk slabs, traffic bollards and lights. As a result, 36 roads and the Cross-Harbor Tunnel were blocked, 96 buses were suspended or rerouted, eight MTR lines were obstructed and more than 200 flights canceled.
From the night of Aug 5 to the early hours of the following day, some radical protesters raided at least 10 police stations. They scribbled words to insult police, hurled petrol bombs and firebombs at police stations and officers, shot vision-harming lasers, ruined police cars, and caused mayhem on several streets, and at police stations and buildings. They also cut off power lines.
¡¤ On Aug 11, protesters threw petrol bombs and wounded at least one policeman.
¡¤ On the evening of Aug 13 and early on Aug 14, violent acts occurred at Hong Kong International Airport. Some radicals attending an unlawful assembly at the airport inflicted severe physical harm on two residents of the Chinese mainland.
Around 8 pm on Aug 13, they unlawfully detained a resident from Shenzhen, Guangdong province, surnamed Xu, who held a Hong Kong and Macao travel permit for private visit purposes and was at the airport to see people off. They tied him up, shot a laser at his eyes and beat him unconscious.
They also obstructed the way for an ambulance crew to take him to hospital. With the help of the police, it took nearly four hours for Xu to be rescued. As the events played out, they also besieged and assaulted a police officer and snatched his baton.
After midnight on Aug 14, some protesters tied both hands of a Global Times reporter surnamed Fu and beat him, suspecting him to be a fake reporter, causing multiple injuries.
The protesters have become better equipped, coordinated and planned, and they have continued to push the level of violence to new heights. Many weapon caches containing explosives, firebombs and knives suspected to be owned by radical protesters have been uncovered in police operations.
From June 9 to Aug 6, the Hong Kong police arrested 589 people suspected of illegal assembly, rioting and assaulting the police.
What is more alarming is that anti-China forces in the West have colluded with local anti-China forces who intend to mess up Hong Kong. On multiple occasions, foreign nationals were seen meeting and talking with radical protesters. Recently, leaders of ""Hong Kong independence"" groups secretly met with officials of the United States Consulate General in Hong Kong. The day after their meeting, the groups said on social media that they plan to boycott classes in September.
It is incontrovertibly evident and without question that the Hong Kong opposition camp and radical groups have colluded with foreign forces. Certain forces in the US and Britain have deliberately ignored extreme violence in the illegal protests and attempted to portray mobsters as campaigners for ""freedom, democracy and human rights"".
During the recent riots, the Hong Kong Police Force has honored its duties and enforced the law with professionalism and great restraint. The police have been a pillar in safeguarding Hong Kong's social security and the last shield to uphold its social stability. It has maintained its reputation as one of the world's most outstanding police forces. From June 9 to Aug 5, 139 officers were injured on duty.
Cornerstone destroyed
Looking back at the past two months, the ordinance amendment issues have changed in their essence and now bear the features of a ""color revolution"".
Should violence and chaos be allowed to continue, the safety of Hong Kong citizens' lives and property will be endangered, and the governance authority of the SAR government, the cornerstone of the rule of law in Hong Kong, its prosperity and stability and the ""one country, two systems"" principle will be destroyed. Citizens of Hong Kong will not allow this to happen. The people of China will not allow this to happen.
On Aug 7, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council and the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong jointly held a symposium in Shenzhen to brief the attendees on the central authorities' policies on stabilizing Hong Kong's situation.
It stressed that the most pressing and overriding task in Hong Kong is to stop the violence, end the chaos and restore order.
The recent violence in Hong Kong is intolerable in any civilized, rational society under the rule of law. Any illegal and criminal acts that blatantly defy the basic principle of ""one country, two systems"", trample the rule of law, destroy social stability and infringe public interests will be brought to justice.

Stability essential for Hong Kong's well-being,"To bring an end to the protests sparked by the proposed amendments to the special administrative region's extradition law, Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor announced on Tuesday her administration's decision not to restart the suspended legislative process for the amendments, saying the ""bill is dead"".
The demonstrations, some of them violent, have threatened the health of the city's economy and thus the well-being of its residents, and Lam also unveiled a raft of practical initiatives aimed at strengthening communication between the SAR government and the public, with the ultimate objective of improving governance in the SAR.
It might be demanding too much of those leading the protests to have the kind of vision and political courage exhibited by the chief executive in her willingness to make compromises in policymaking in the face of public opposition. But they should have the wisdom to realize that persistent political conflict and unrest do not bode well for the city and residents, especially at a time when the local economy is still licking its wounds from the ongoing Sino-US trade row.
Hong Kong's economy has slowed significantly over recent months, with the year-on-year GDP growth having eased to 0.6 percent in the first quarter of this year - the slowest expansion in a decade - as both foreign trade and domestic consumption have been hard hit by the trade conflict between the Chinese mainland and the United States, the city's two largest trading partners. Any escalation of the social conflict witnessed recently will only further harm Hong Kong's economy and people's livelihoods.
The organizers of some of the mass rallies have said they will announce more protests in the coming days. But more social unrest will only hinder efforts to tackle the fundamental problems that have a tangible effect on the lives of Hong Kong residents, particularly the younger generation - such as the severe housing shortage, lack of social upward mobility and the widening wealth gap, which have fueled the social discontent.
The violent acts instigated by those who have an axe to grind against the central government shows they could not care less about the overall interest of Hong Kong society and are merely exploiting the controversy over the extradition law amendment to advance their own agenda, as they have done with other social issues before. They should be shunned by those who have Hong Kong's best interests at heart.
Now that the SAR government has called time on the amendment bill, it can turn its attention to the most important matters at hand - economic development and improving people's livelihoods. Those who really want the best for Hong Kong should be willing to work with the SAR government to tackle the deep-seated problems the SAR faces."
Rule of law is Hong Kong's most valuable possession,"In its first ever news briefing on Monday, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, the country's top office in charge of the affairs of the two special administrative regions, expressed the central government's concern about the well-being of Hong Kong in light of the continuing violent protests in the city.
No society under the rule of law will tolerate rampant violence, a spokesperson said, calling on all sectors of Hong Kong society to ""clearly oppose violence"", ""strongly uphold the rule of law"" and end the political gridlock to focus on economic development and improving people's livelihoods.
Weeks of violence by a few radicals have damaged Hong Kong's reputation of being one of the safest cities in the world. Already, some foreign governments, such as those of Japan and the Republic of Korea, have issued travel warnings to their citizens and there has been a significant drop in the number of tourist arrivals recently. Local consumer sentiment has also turned sour with growing worries about jobs. As a result, a double-digit decline in both tourist arrivals and retail sales has been forecast for the month of July by government officials.
Business confidence has also been dented, and any prolonged violence could further dampen consumer and business confidence, which would not bode well for the livelihoods of Hong Kong people.
The unbridled assaults on police officers, the legislature building and other government premises have dealt a big blow to Hong Kong's rule of law. In a statement on Monday, police said 49""radical protesters"" had been arrested for a variety of offenses during clashes on Sunday, when rioters hurled bricks, bottles, paint bombs and corrosive liquids at police, and even a crossbow was used to fire ball bearings.
The rule of law is a core value Hong Kong people revere and defend like a faith as it is the strongest pillar that underpins the city's global competitiveness. Any further erosion of it could herald a permanent decline for the city.
The Hong Kong Police Force, which has demonstrated admirable courage, fortitude and professionalism in its operations to restore order in the face of the shocking acts by the radical protesters, has the full support of the central government.
Now the majority of Hong Kong residents that abhor the violence need to make themselves heard. They have expressed their support for the Hong Kong Police Force and objection to the antics of the radical protesters. But the violence unleashed again by the extremists over the weekend suggests they need to express their objections in a stronger voice and a more serious manner.
Maintaining social harmony and stability serves the interests of all in Hong Kong as well as those of outside investors. It is also a prerequisite for addressing the deep-seated problems that have built up over a long period of time.
If the disorder persists, it will be the whole of Hong Kong society that pays the price."
Demonstrators betray hidden US hand behind HK protests,"A chameleon can change only its color but never its skin. For an apt example, look no further than the demonstrators in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. On the surface, they may seem to be protesting to safeguard the freedom they enjoy or seek more freedom. Dig a little deeper and it will be evident their motive is anything but that.
On Sunday, the evidence was visible on the streets of the SAR where thousands of demonstrators marched to the United States consulate, urging US President Donald Trump to ""liberate"" their city.
Do we need more evidence to prove outside forces are behind the separatist demonstrations in the SAR?
The fact that the demonstrators, many of them in black shirts and wearing masks, waved the US flag and carried posters that read ""President Trump, please liberate Hong Kong"" should fly in the face of Washington, which has denied any role in the SAR protests.
Slogans such as ""Resist Beijing, Liberate Hong Kong"" and ""Stand with Hong Kong, Fight for freedom"" that the insurrectionists shouted speak volumes about what they really want. Worse, in a letter reportedly submitted to the US consulate officials, the separatists have urged Washington to pass the proposed ""Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019"".
Hong Kong is an inseparable part of China - and that is the bottom line no one should challenge, not the demonstrators, not the foreign forces playing their dirty games.
The demonstrators, students in particular, who have been cajoled by outside forces into believing in something that is not only impossible but also harmful to even attempt should know they are being led into a dark tunnel with no opening.
That the outside forces' evil designs are doomed to failure can never be overemphasized, but it is a pity some Hong Kong youths are so detached from reality that they still believe the US is an epitome of fairness and justice.
It's time for them to return to their senses and stop trying the patience of the central government. They have already challenged the bottom line of ""one country, two systems"" by seeking US help to achieve their nefarious goal of ""Hong Kong independence"".
The demonstrations in Hong Kong are not about rights or democracy. They are a result of foreign interference. Lest the central government's restraint be misconstrued as weakness, let it be clear secessionism in any form will be crushed. The Hong Kong SAR is an integral part of China and will remain so."
Preserving HK's bridging role in everyone's interest,"Hong Kong has long been a beacon of inspiration for other Asian cities. Highly competitive and connected, it has served as a bridge between the East and the West, earning it the moniker ""Asia's world city"". But this position is now under threat - and it is Hong Kong's own fault.
For several months, Hong Kong has been seized by protests that began against a bill to amend the extradition law. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's government has dropped the bill but the protests have continued.
HK at risk due to its own insecurities
Hong Kong's advantages are now at risk, largely due to its own insecurities. As several commentators have pointed out, the Chinese mainland's remarkable economic growth and development has eroded Hong Kong's status as a leading center for finance, logistics and trade. In 1997, when Hong Kong was reunited with the motherland, the city handled half of the mainland's foreign trade, and its GDP amounted to nearly one-fifth of the mainland. It far outperformed Shanghai - the mainland's most prosperous city - in terms of GDP, per capita income and shipping volume.
Today, Hong Kong accounts for just one-eighth of China's trade. In terms of GDP, it now lags behind not only Shanghai but also Beijing and Shenzhen. In terms of shipping volume, even a much smaller mainland city such as Ningbo outperforms Hong Kong.
Even more frustrating for Hong Kong residents, however, is the rising inequality in the SAR - a trend that has been exacerbated by the world's highest property prices. But it is local politics, not the central government, that has hampered the provision of more affordable public housing and impeded action to improve skills and employment opportunities.
When it comes to Hong Kong's economic and financial position, the central government's initiatives should help. In particular, the Greater Bay Area urban cluster, covering nine cities around the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong province, plus Hong Kong and Macao, holds great potential. Yet some in Hong Kong are resisting such integration, arguing that it will further erode their political autonomy, economic strength and local identity.
The question is why Hong Kong's (largely local) grievances have spurred such large-scale demonstrations.
Polarized social media facilitate mass action
The answer may lie partly in the internet - or, more precisely, in the digital echo chambers being created by social media. Hardly limited to Hong Kong, the phenomenon was a driving force behind the global wave of demonstrations in 2009-12: the Green Movement in Iran, the ""Arab Spring"" in the Middle East, Occupy Wall Street in the United States, and the anti-austerity protests in Portugal, Spain and Greece.
In his book Networks of Outrage and Hope: Social Movements in the Internet Age, social theorist Manuel Castells argues that such ""multifaceted rebellions"" were driven not so much by poverty, economics, or lack of democracy as by ""the humiliation provoked by the cynicism and arrogance of those in power"".
But it was only through networking that such emotions were translated into mass action. Those who felt humiliated by the powerful ""ignored political parties, distrusted the media, did not recognize any leadership, and rejected all formal organization"". Instead, they sought to exercise ""counter power"" by ""constructing themselves... through a process of autonomous communication, free from the control of those holding institutional power"".
Fear transformed into outrage
Social-media platforms facilitated this process. But in bringing together those with similar perspectives on local issues, they cut them off from opposing views. This fueled polarization, causing fear to be transformed into outrage, and in some cases, ""outrage into hope for a better humanity"".
Such horizontally networked, emotion-driven movements often give way to violence, as Hong Kong is now learning. Recently, protesters stormed and vandalized the Legislative Council building and, later, the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong SAR.
Such activities, together with the spread of demonstrations into local districts, leave police stretched to their limits. This puts the protesters themselves in danger: days ago, dozens of masked men armed with batons attacked people returning from a demonstration at a metro station. Forty-five people were hospitalized - one critically.
In this highly charged and deeply polarized atmosphere, preserving Hong Kong's position as a stable and reliable bridge between the mainland and the rest of the world will not be easy. But it is in everyone's interest. The first step will be to conduct a serious discussion on the ""one country, two systems"" framework, especially on how to balance the autonomy promised by ""two systems"" with the sovereignty guaranteed by ""one country"".
In this process, Hong Kong people must make a vital calculation. As the most international part of China, Hong Kong has a major role to play in shaping China's ongoing global integration and encouraging openness. If it abdicates this role, the central government will forge ahead anyway, only that Hong Kong will be left behind.

"Lam regrets clashes, says amendment to HK law to advance","Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor expressed deep regret on Monday over clashes between radical protesters and the city's police during an unauthorized assembly in the early hours following Sunday's mass protest.
She said the police are taking serious action against any illegal conduct.
Lam said the special administrative region government will press ahead with its proposal to amend the city's extradition law, but promised to make more efforts to address public concerns over the change.
The clashes Lam described took place during an unauthorized assembly that followed a mass public procession on Sunday against the SAR government's amendments to the extradition law. At least 240,000 people joined a public procession to oppose the proposed bill, police said.
Currently, the SAR has agreements on reciprocal transfers of fugitives with 20 other jurisdictions, not including Taiwan, Macao and the Chinese mainland. The revision will allow Hong Kong to surrender fugitives on a case-by-case basis to jurisdictions that do not have long-term rendition agreements with the city.
Near the Legislative Council Complex in Admiralty, Hong Kong Island, radical protesters refused to disperse after midnight despite police officers' repeated calls to leave. They later attacked officers and blocked roads, officials said. The unauthorized assembly ended around 6 am after police law enforcement action.
Eight police officers were hurt during the incident, police said. Police arrested 19 persons, aged between 19 and 34, on suspicion of unlawful assembly and obstructing police officers. Some 358 people detained early Monday on suspicion of participating in the illegal assembly were released.
Police condemned the violence, citing the discovery of dangerous implements like scissors and razor blades at the scene.
Lam, addressing reporters hours after the assembly ended, said the government would not withdraw its proposed amendment, which she called an effective way to prevent Hong Kong from becoming a haven for fugitives.
But she also promised more efforts to address public concerns, worries and anxiety over the bill.
Lam said the SAR government needs to ensure the bill's human rights safeguards have a legally binding effect on the SAR. Lam also promised the government will provide regular reports to the city's legislature about the bill's implementation once it is passed and enacted.
Other dignitaries and political parties in the city also expressed strong disapproval of the clashes.
Commissioner of Police Stephen Lo Wai-chung strongly condemned violent conduct by demonstrators and underlined that police will continue to investigate lawbreakers who hid their identities with masks.
In a statement released on Monday morning, members of the advisory Executive Council, which assists the chief executive in policymaking, also expressed regret over the acts of a small number of protesters.
Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong, the city's largest political party representing business in the Legislative Council, strongly condemned protesters who adopted violent and illegal means, saying such unacceptable conduct would severely damage Hong Kong's international reputation.
The bill will go through a second reading at the Legislative Council on Wednesday as scheduled.
In a news conference in Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang stressed the central government will continue to firmly support the Hong Kong SAR in amending the extradition law.
Geng said the Hong Kong government has attentively listened to opinions from various sectors since February and made changes in the bill in response to public concerns.
An alliance of local political, business and legal figures said that a citywide petition campaign that started in April had gathered some 845,000 signatures in support of the amendment as of 6 pm on Monday.

HK protesters should end violence as residents' livelihoods are at stake,"THE DEMONSTRATIONS AND VIOLENCE IN HONG KONG over the past three months have dealt a serious blow to the city's tourism industry, undermining its image as an international tourist destination and affecting the livelihoods of the city's residents, especially those employed in the tourism industry. China Daily writer Wang Yiqing comments:
August is the traditional tourist peak season for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. But the violent demonstrations have kept tourists away from Hong Kong this August.
According to Chen Maobo, financial secretary to the Hong Kong SAR government, tourist arrivals in August dropped by 2.4 million, a decline of 40 percent year-on-year, causing an economic loss of 12 billion yuan ($1.69 billion) to the tourism industry. The occupancy rate in some Hong Kong hotels declined by more than 50 percent, with room tariff dropping by 40 to 70 percent. The retail and catering industries, too, have suffered huge losses.
Worse, Hong Kong's tourism industry estimates that tourist groups, including those from the Chinese mainland, visiting Hong Kong during the upcoming National Day Golden Week will also decline sharply. And since tourism is a pillar industry of Hong Kong, the decline in tourist arrivals will cause immense damage to the city's economy.
More importantly, the chaos in Hong Kong has seriously affected the livelihoods of ordinary Hong Kong residents, especially those working in tourism-related sectors. According to a survey conducted by three Hong Kong tourism labor unions released on Aug 12, more than 1,000 respondents working in the tourism industry said their income had declined by about 80 percent, with about 10 percent saying they had zero income in the past two months.
Ordinary residents have to pay for the mayhem caused by violent demonstrations in Hong Kong. So instead of continuing to hurt the interests of Hong Kong residents and undermine the SAR's economy, the demonstrators should return to their senses and stop the violence.

Macao can play the role of an ideal offshore yuan center,"The yuan has become the world's fifth-largest payment currency, third-largest currency for settling trade deals, eighth-largest foreign exchange currency and sixth-largest reserve currency. More than 60 countries' central banks or monetary authorities have incorporated the yuan in their foreign exchange reserves. Over 320,000 enterprises and more than 270 banks have launched cross-border yuan businesses, and 242 countries and regions have established cross-border yuan receipt and payment business with China. Which means the yuan's internationalization process is moving forward steadily.
But since the United States' trade war against China and the violent protests in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have affected the yuan's internationalization process, China has to build more stable offshore centers to facilitate its internationalization. For example, China could use the advantages of the Macao Special Administrative Region's offshore financial center to build an offshore yuan center and explore business in the Portuguese-speaking countries.
The cumulative population of the eight Portuguese-speaking countries that have diplomatic relations with China is more than 260 million while their total GDP is about $2 trillion. And in 2018, trade between China and Portuguese-speaking countries was worth $147.3 billion.
China's imports from Portuguese-speaking countries are remarkably higher than China's exports to those countries, which is conducive to promoting the yuan as a currency to settle foreign trade. Brazil's central bank has already signed a currency swap agreement with China's central bank, and the central banks of countries such as Angola, Mozambique and Cape Verde make official quotations in their national currencies with reference to the yuan, providing the basic condition for the yuan to enter their local markets.
And since these countries appear intent on incorporating the yuan into their reserve currencies, the promotion of business between China and Portuguese-speaking countries could help Beijing explore new markets for facilitating the yuan's internationalization.
Macao shares many traits, including language, syncretic culture and legal system, with Portuguese-speaking countries because of historic reasons, and therefore enjoys an advantage when it comes to building offshore yuan centers in those countries.
Besides, the Macao SAR has a sound yuan clearing system, and the Monetary Authority of Macao supports the development of yuan business. In fact, building yuan clearing centers in Portuguese-speaking countries is one of the three major financial policies of Macao.
Macao has all the yuan business channels that Hong Kong has; it has also implemented some innovative and pilot projects in yuan business. The Macao branch of the Bank of China dealt with the first cross-border financing business of China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone and provided the first cross-border loan under the free trade account framework. And earlier this year, the Ministry of Finance issued 2 billion yuan ($175.67 million) worth of yuan treasury bonds in Macao for the first time.
Macao has the right conditions and capability to be a sub-center of yuan business, as well as a backup platform for Hong Kong's yuan operations. As such, it will serve as an ideal center to develop a comprehensive cross-border yuan business system.
If trade between China and Portuguese-speaking countries rise continuously, China could promote the yuan as a trade settlement currency, which in turn would enable the yuan to play the role of an international currency in those countries. The authorities should therefore accelerate the construction of Macao as an offshore yuan center and establish a currency swap agreement between the Monetary Authority of Macao and the People's Bank of China, in order to provide liquidity support to Macao's yuan market.
Also, Macao's financial sector should accelerate the building of a China-Portuguese-speaking countries investment and financing platform to prompt those countries to use the yuan for investment and for financing projects.
Moreover, the Macao SAR should encourage more local government enterprises to issue yuan bonds and urge Portuguese-speaking countries' enterprises to issue Panda Bonds through Macao's financial organizations, so as to connect the yuan-denominated market.

Beijing demands West 'stops meddling in HK',"A senior Chinese official urged the United States and some other Western countries on Thursday to stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs.
The US and some other countries have been mixing right and wrong, stirring up trouble during the recent violent incidents over the revision of an extradition amendment bill in Hong Kong, said Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, in an interview with Xinhua News Agency.
They also arranged for senior officials to meet leading anti-China figures and supported the illegal activities of extreme, violent protesters with the aim of undermining the prosperity and security of Hong Kong, Yang said.
""We strongly demand the US and some other Western countries abide by international law and basic norms governing international relations, sincerely honor their hands-off promises on Hong Kong affairs and immediately stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs in any form,"" he said.
Also on Thursday, the Hong Kong Police Force will step up enforcement efforts in handling violent protests, according to Lam Chi-wai, chairman of the Junior Police Officers' Association.
On behalf of over 20,000 frontline officers, Lam expressed confidence in their ability to safeguard law and order in the city.
In a group interview, Lam said extreme, violent acts by radical protesters, whom he called rioters, are likely to continue in coming weeks amid social disputes over the now-suspended extradition bill. He said police have sufficient equipment, personnel and capabilities to maintain the rule of law.
""We are 100 percent confident in safeguarding Hong Kong's law and order, protecting public security and resuming the city's stability as soon as possible,"" Lam said.
Anyone who participated in unauthorized assemblies broke the law, he said, adding that police would do their utmost to deter violent acts, including using more force. However, Lam stressed that only the minimum necessary force has been used when dispersing illegal protesters.
Hong Kong officers have acted with great restraint compared with law enforcement officers in other places, including the US, Italy and Russia. Even though police officers have been injured, not one bullet from a real gun has been fired against protesters, Lam said.

Details of National Day parade unveiled to public,"More than 100,000 people are expected to take part in a massive parade at Beijing's Tian'anmen Square on the morning of Oct 1 - National Day - to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, it was announced on Thursday.
The parade, with marching groups, will feature floats and music during a free and lively show, Du Feijin, head of the publicity department of the Beijing Committee of the Communist Party of China, said at a news conference in Beijing.
It will include participants from all walks of life and ethnic groups, he said.
Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan compatriots, as well as overseas Chinese and foreigners, will also join the parade, Du added.
The 70 years of growth and hard work since the founding of New China will be displayed via groups of marchers, each telling the story of a period of time, Du said.
Tian'anmen Square will feature red decorations representing the glorious history of the Party as it led the Chinese revolution to victory, he said, adding that 70 red lanterns will be hung parallel to the east and west sides of the square.
About 10 Hong Kong police officers, including some injured while coping with recent violent protests in Hong Kong, were invited to attend a gala show on the evening of Oct 1, China Central Television reported on Thursday.
Starting next month, a series of grand events are planned to celebrate the 70th anniversary. An exhibition featuring the achievements over the past 70 years will be held at the Beijing Exhibition Center starting in September.
Activities including raising the national flag, singing the national anthem, commemorating revolutionary martyrs and singing competitions will be held nationwide to let more people take part in celebrating the birthday of the motherland, he added.
A documentary featuring highlights during the 70-year journey will also be broadcast on TV and a set of commemorative coins and stamps will be issued.

HKSAR blasts Taipei for wrangling over suspect,"The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government slammed Taiwan authorities for ""irresponsible"" handling of the voluntary surrender of Chan Tongkai, 20, a Hong Kong resident and a suspect in a murder in Taiwan, whose case helped fuel months of social unrest in Hong Kong.
Taipei's request for cross-jurisdiction law enforcement in Chan's case shows ""utter disrespect"" for Hong Kong's jurisdiction and is totally unacceptable, Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu said at the Legislative Council on Wednesday.
Taiwan authorities should bear all responsibility if justice cannot be served because they set up hurdles and restrictions to obstruct Chan's surrender, Lee added, accusing Taiwan authorities of shifting the blame to Hong Kong and acting on political motives.
Also Wednesday, Lee announced the official withdrawal of the proposed extradition bill, which has sparked months of anti-government protests. Chan's case had been cited by the SAR government as the primary reason for the amendment, a move to plug loopholes in the city's extradition laws.
Chan is a suspect in the killing of his pregnant girlfriend, Poon Hiu-wing, in Taiwan in February last year. He was arrested by Hong Kong police after fleeing to the city, and was convicted of money laundering for stealing from his late girlfriend's bank accounts. During the investigation, police said, he confessed that he killed Poon.
Taiwan authorities issued a warrant for Chan and asked the Hong Kong government to surrender the fugitive.
On Friday, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor received a letter from Chan expressing his willingness to turn himself in to Taiwan authorities to face murder charges.
Taiwan previously had rejected accepting Chan's surrender, instead insisting first on the signing of a mutual legal assistance framework with the SAR, while asking Hong Kong to provide any evidence it had in the case.
In a surprising U-turn on Tuesday, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council proposed having their law enforcement officers escort Chan back to Taiwan.
On Wednesday, Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen blamed Hong Kong for being ""reluctant to exercise their jurisdictional power to bring justice to the victim's family"". She said that Chan could not just get on a plane and turn himself in once in Taiwan, but would have to be arrested in Hong Kong.
HKSAR Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah said she firmly rejected Tsai's allegations, adding that Hong Kong's Department of Justice does not have the legal basis to charge Chan with murder or to detain him.
""Taiwan has jurisdiction over this case, as the murder case occurred in Taiwan, with almost all evidence in Taiwan,"" she said, referring to Hong Kong's territorial principle. The principle is part of international law under which governments can prosecute crime within their borders but are prevented from exercising jurisdiction beyond their borders.
The SAR said that Taiwan officers have no power to enforce laws in Hong Kong.
On Tuesday, Tam Yiu-chung, Hong Kong's sole representative to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said Taiwan's request put politics over justice. He called it a tactic to be wielded during the 2020 election in Taiwan.
On Wednesday morning, Chan, walked out of the prison after serving 18 months in prison for money laundering and apologized to the victim's family. He also pleaded with Hong Kong residents for forgiveness, since his case was a spark for months of anti-government protests.

President voices trust in HK chief executive,"President Xi Jinping on Monday met with Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor as she attended the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai.
After hearing Lam's report on the recent situation in Hong Kong, Xi, noting that the disturbances in Hong Kong have lasted five months, said Lam has led the SAR government to fully discharge its duties, strive to stabilize the situation and improve the social atmosphere, and has done a lot of hard work.
Xi voiced the central government's high degree of trust in Lam and full acknowledgment of the work of her and her governance team.
Ending violence and chaos and restoring order remain the most important tasks for Hong Kong at present, he said.
Xi demanded unswerving efforts to stop and punish violent activities in accordance with the law to safeguard the well-being of the general public in Hong Kong.
Meanwhile, effective efforts should be made in work including engaging in dialogue with all sectors of society and improving people's livelihoods, Xi said.
He expressed his hope that people from all walks of life in Hong Kong fully and faithfully implement the principle of ""one country, two systems"" and the HKSAR Basic Law, and make concerted efforts to safeguard Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.
Briefing the media on the sidelines of the expo, Lam expressed her will to end violence in Hong Kong after Xi reaffirmed support for her.
Lam vowed that she and her administration will continue to work in strict accordance with the ""one country two systems"" principle, uphold the rule of law and try to put an end to the violence.
Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said Xi's remarks are ""a shot in the arm"" for the Hong Kong government to end violence and restore social order. He made the remarks before the weekly Executive Council meeting on Tuesday as acting CE during Lam's visit on the mainland.
Describing the meeting as ""a vote of confidence"", Cheung said it showed that Xi attached high importance to Hong Kong. ""All this is particularly reassuring to us,"" he said.
Cheung added that the meeting helped the SAR government find a clear direction for accomplishing future tasks such as strengthening communication with the public and addressing deep-seated social problems.
The official noted that a second open community dialogue would be held after the District Council elections. In the meantime, the government will continue to hold closed-door focus group meetings to better gauge public opinion, he said.
He also noted the government will soon roll out another set of relief measures for the troubled catering, retail and logistics sectors to help them endure the technical recession the city is facing.
The recognition from the central government was also hailed by local political and business leaders as timely support for the embattled SAR government.
Veteran politician Tam Yiuchung, Hong Kong's deputy to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said Xi's recognition of Lam would help stabilize the situation as it crushed rumors about a reshuffling of the SAR leadership.
A recent report by The Financial Times claimed that Beijing is seeking to replace Lam by March. Speculation has also surfaced recently that some SAR officials and Executive Council members providing advice to Lam may also be replaced.
Local political commentator Lau Siu-kai said Xi's remarks will help enhance the credibility of the embattled SAR government and create favorable conditions for its future work.
Amid the ongoing anti-government protests, the government has met with unprecedented challenges brought by local rioters, opposition camps and external forces, said Lau, who is also vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies.
The support from the central authorities is much-needed for the SAR government to end violence and restore social order, a challenging task during the severe time, Lau said.
David Wong Yau-kar, a Hong Kong deputy to the National People's Congress, said Xi's remarks reflected that the central government wants sound political wisdom from Lam in handling the crisis in Hong Kong.
In effectively stopping violence and restoring law and order, the SAR government needs to be tough enough, and actively mobilize manpower from functional departments, Wong said.
But in terms of dialogue with the community, and improving the city's deep-rooted livelihood issues, it requires prolonged efforts with a mild approach, he added.

Opportunity for Hong Kong to put its house in order,"It might be too early to breathe a sigh of relief assuming that the demonstrations in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will end soon. But there are indeed signs, suggesting that the city, plagued by two months of violence, could be on the right track to end the disturbances.
Over the past several days, the city has been spared the violence that had become a common occurrence since the middle of June. The latest public rally organized by the demonstrators on Sunday was generally peaceful, with the attendees expressing their opinions in a civilized manner. It is hoped that weeks of turbulence have finally brought home the message that violence will get them nowhere.
The newfound peace has afforded the SAR government a chance to seek an end to the current turmoil through dialogue. Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, chief executive of the HKSAR, said on Tuesday the SAR government will set up a communication platform to hold dialogue with the Hong Kong community, with the aim of helping the city move on from the present undesirable situation.
She also said there will be a fact-finding inquiry into the causes of the protests and the police response to them.
Members of the city's opposition camp should be realistic and pragmatic when putting forward their demands. Any demands or proposals raised in the process must be reasonable and fall within the bounds of law, particularly the Basic Law. Indeed, that the radicals have been insisting on unreasonable and illegal demands has been the reason the upheaval has dragged on for over two months, causing huge damage to the city.
Dialogue can help enhance mutual understanding among different elements in society. But it would be unrealistic for anyone to expect that a panacea for all of Hong Kong's deep-seated social problems can be found in one fell swoop.
In extending an olive branch, the SAR government has undoubtedly expressed its sincere desire to end the current chaotic situation in the city. But this friendly gesture should in no way be interpreted as an invitation for illegal and unreasonable demands from political radicals.
Previously, the SAR government had shunned the idea of holding dialogue with protesters. No legitimate government in the world will allow itself to be forced into holding dialogue with insurrectionists through intimidation. Should the demonstrators continue to use violence and make far-fetched demands, the opportunity for dialogue will be lost."
Diplomat: Rioters seek to replace HKSAR,"Protracted social unrest in Hong Kong is actually an attempt to overthrow the special administrative region government and turn the city into an ""independent or semi-independent political entity"", China's top diplomat in the HKSAR said on Thursday.
Calling the attempt ""no more than wishful thinking"", Xie Feng, commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in the Hong Kong SAR, appealed to the international community not to endorse any form of violence.
Addressing the opening ceremony of the International Forum on the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, Xie labeled the street violence in Hong Kong a ""virus that is even more deadly than SARS"".
Protests sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill have gripped the city for over four months. Masked, black-clad rioters have hurled gasoline bombs at police and committed arson and vandalism, damaging government buildings, subway stations and mainland-related stores and restaurants. Masked protesters also have beaten people bloody, solely because they voiced different opinions.
Retail sales tumbled 23 percent year-on-year in August, the sharpest monthly drop on record, officials said. The tourism industry, another economic pillar, saw a 40 percent year-on-year decline in visitor arrivals that month. Hotel occupancy, which has fallen roughly 50 percent overall, has dropped by as much as 80 percent in areas hardest hit by protests.
Xie said that behind the violence is the ""black hand"" - the opposition in Hong Kong and foreign forces, who have been selectively blind and deaf to violence and told blatant lies to romanticize it.
Their true motive is ""to mess up the city, overthrow the legitimate government, seize jurisdiction and ultimately destroy 'one country, two systems' by turning Hong Kong into an independent or semi-independent political entity,"" he said.
Xie warned that should the Pandora's box of street violence be opened and the rioters continue to ""defy the law for the sake of justice"" as they claim, human civilization as a whole would be plunged into calamity, and no country would be immune. He called on the international community not to remain silent, stand idly by or gloat at the unrest in Hong Kong, much less endorse the rioters.
Xie's remarks echoed what spokesman for the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Yang Guang said in September, that the Hong Kong protests showed signs of a ""color revolution"".
On the same occasion, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said the city would hold fast to the ""one country, two systems"" principle as well as the rule of law to ride out the ""unprecedented"" political storm in the SAR.
Somkid Jatusripitak, deputy prime minister of Thailand, said a similar situation had happened in his country, resulting in Thailand missing out on development opportunities for several years.
""In these difficult circumstances, I believe that everyone with (a sense of) inner justice will see the efforts made by the chief executive (of Hong Kong) to alleviate the problem in a sensible manner and in a peaceful manner,"" Somkid said.

Outside meddling has colored protests,"Following the storming of the Legislative Council and the vandalizing of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, unapproved protests on Saturday and Sunday have brought the lawlessness surrounding the recent anti-extradition law amendment to a new high. Unlike previous protests, the weekend rallies were not approved by the police because of the escalating violence in the associated areas - Yuen Long on Saturday and Western District on Sunday.
However, ban-defying protesters still gathered. And, just like in previous protests, violence broke out later with rioters wearing helmets and face masks, some armed with metal rods, hurling bricks at police officers.
Such illegal assemblies, not to mention the ensuing violence, are a clear demonstration of the protesters' total defiance of the law. They no longer bother to pretend that their acts are lawful and peaceful expressions of opinions. Without police approval for the protests, they broke the law from the very beginning.
The anti-extradition law amendment campaign has been depicted by its supporters and the Western media, which has publicized and glorified them all along, as spontaneous and having no central command. That is what the forces behind it want the world to believe. Yet judging from the preparation, targeting strategies, riot tactics and abundance of supplies, it takes naivety akin to simplemindedness to truly believe these activities are not being carefully orchestrated.
While the foot soldiers were charging, some of the figures behind the scenes popped up in the crowds. A media tycoon who recently met with United States Vice-President Mike Pence was spotted on Saturday, while a number of opposition legislators stood between the police line and the protesters as if they were negotiators. They kept asking police officers to give the protesters time to retreat and leave, while in fact they were buying them for the mob to regroup.
What is happening in Hong Kong is no longer the airing of real or imagined grievances. It is of the same hue as the color revolutions that were instigated in the Middle East and North Africa - local anti-government elements colluding with external forces to topple governments utilizing modern communication technology to spread rumors, distrust and fear.
What is different here is that the central government as well as the majority of Hong Kong residents will stand firmly behind the SAR government and the police to foil their schemes."
"Elites, inequality are HK's real problem by Andrew Sheng and Xiao Geng","Since China regained sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, the city has prospered economically, but festered politically. Now, one of the world's richest cities is engulfed by protests, with demonstrators blocking roads, paralyzing the airport, and at times unleashing violence. Far from a uniquely Chinese problem, however, the current chaos should be viewed as a bellwether for capitalist systems that fail to address inequality.
In times of crisis, it is easy for emotion to overwhelm reason, and for dramatic and deceptive narratives to take root. This tendency is exemplified by media reports that call the unrest a ""clash of cultures"" symbolizing a broader global struggle between autocracy and democracy, or references to a ""fight between two civilizations"", as Hong Kong legislator Fernando Cheung put it.
Such narratives often treat ""democracy"" as synonymous with improved welfare - a characterization that is not borne out by the facts. As political scientist Francis Fukuyama has conceded, centralized systems can deliver economic outcomes that are superior to decentralized, inefficient democratic governments.
But those who think the central government will resort to a military-led crackdown forget Sun Tzu's dictum that winning wars without fighting is the ""acme of skill"". The central government is well aware that if Hong Kong becomes a political or ideological battleground, peace and prosperity will suffer in the city as well as on the Chinese mainland. Given this fact, the central government is willing to go to great lengths to uphold the ""one country, two systems"" framework under which Hong Kong has been given special administrative region status.
What the central government is not willing to do is consider independence for the city. Like a parent dealing with a frustrated teenager, the central government views the current unrest as a family matter that must be resolved internally. By appealing to countries such as the United States to intervene in the SAR, some Hong Kong demonstrators have not only crossed the bottom line of national sovereignty, but also turned a blind eye to the long and destructive track record of Washington's ""democracy-building"" efforts around the world, from Central America to Central Asia.
The reality is, Hong Kong is a living example of how the rule of law and electoral democracy can work within the Chinese context. The city ranks 16th in the World Justice Project's Rule of Law Index, right behind Japan and ahead of France (17th), Spain (21st) and Italy (28th). As for electoral democracy, however, there are significant challenges, which have little to do with the central government.
A powerful, but oft-ignored, factor underlying the frustrations of Hong Kong residents is inequality. Hong Kong's Gini coefficient - in which zero represents maximum equality and one represents maximum inequality - now stands at 0.539, its highest level in 45 years. By comparison, the highest Gini coefficient among the major developed economies is 0.411(in the US).
This inequality is most starkly apparent in housing. The per capita residential space in Hong Kong is just 16 square meters (172 square feet), compared with 36 square meters in Shanghai. Moreover, whereas nearly 45 percent of Hong Kong residents live in public rental or subsidized housing, 90 percent of mainland households own at least one home.
Yet despite having fiscal reserves of more than HK$1.2 trillion ($147 billion), the Hong Kong SAR government has failed to address inequality, precisely because of the electoral politics to which the protesters are so committed. The city's Legislative Council - whose members are elected through a complicated process based on proportional representation - is too politically and ideologically divided to reach a consensus.
Unable to push through tough reforms to subdue vested interests, as the central government is doing on the mainland, the LegCo is also vulnerable to the influence of real estate developers eager to block measures that would lower prices, such as the allocation of land for more public housing.
Some companies are reportedly hoarding huge plots of unused rural land, either directly or through shell companies, to constrain supply. The Hong Kong demonstrators believe they haven't been heard. But it is the city's own elites, not the central government, that have failed them. Hong Kong politicians were so thoroughly out of touch with ordinary people that the protests took them by surprise, despite signals from social media and the free (though adversarial) press.
This means that, beyond addressing concrete problems such as high housing prices, Hong Kong will need to reopen channels of communication between the public and policymakers. This will not be easy, not least because the protests lack any clear leaders. But some consensus on how to move forward as a community will be needed to ensure the local government's legitimacy while it implements needed reforms.
It will take time for Hong Kong to recover from these months of upheaval. But all Chinese, from Beijing to Hong Kong, know that there are no quick fixes to problems. Progress is a never-ending series of small steps, many of which must be made in difficult conditions. The only way to succeed is with humility, patience, wisdom and a sense of shared destiny.

"Violence, vandalism blasted as HK protests linger","A fresh round of violence and vandalism targeting Hong Kong's MTR stations and shopping malls over the weekend sparked wide condemnation as Hong Kong was roiled by anti-government protests for the 16th week.
Over the past weekend, radicals once again hurled bricks and gasoline bombs at police officers and police vehicles and set fire to barricades. Some radicals even attempted to snatch a police officer's revolver.
Some protesters also desecrated a Chinese national flag near a shopping mall in Sha Tin, the New Territories. They stamped on the flag, smeared it and dumped it into a trash can before throwing it into a river. This was another case in which the national flag was stained, burned and trod on in a public place in Hong Kong.
Tung Chee-hwa, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the city's former chief executive, stressed that radical extremists' open desecration of national flags has seriously hurt the feelings of the nation's 1.4 billion people.
In a 618-word open letter in Chinese, the former chief executive said he felt ""extremely angry, sad, and exceedingly worried"" to see Hong Kong on the edge of danger after nearly four months of political unrest.
A small group of ""radical rioters"" abused the special administrative region's tolerance by attempting to challenge the rule of law and paralyze the SAR government through illegal acts including blocking roads, arson and attacking people, he said.
Amid protests last weekend, a 13-year-old girl was arrested on suspicion of burning a national flag in Tuen Mun.
""These acts not only violated the National Flag and National Emblem Ordinance, but were also open provocation on national dignity, and a reckless challenge to the bottom line of the 'one country, two systems' principle,"" Tung remarked.
In response to the attempted revolver snatching, Lam Chi-wai, president of the Junior Police Officers' Association of the Hong Kong Police Force, strongly condemned such acts that posed a grave threat to the lives of officers and other people present nearby.
""Firearms are the second life of police officers ... all police officers were told on the first day of starting service that they should try every means to protect firearms from being snatched,"" Lam said. ""Otherwise they'll be in danger.""
The officers would have to make the ""only"" and ""necessary"" choice if their firearms are taken, Lam warned.
The mayhem over the weekend also drew criticism from political heavyweights. Lau Yu-leung, a Hong Kong member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said he was saddened by the outrageous acts of violence perpetrated in total disregard of the law.
He urged protesters, the majority of them young people, to immediately stop the violence.
""Hong Kong is our home. Young people are bound to suffer the consequences if our home is destroyed,"" Lau said.
During the weekend's protests, MTR stations once again became a primary target of radicals. At least eight MTR stations across the city were forced to shut down on Sunday after black-clad protesters went on a rampage.
In a statement issued on Sunday night, MTR Corporation Limited, the city's sole railway operator, condemned the latest eruption of violence that severely affected journeys and endangered the safety of passengers and MTR staff.
On Sunday, a group of black-clad and masked protesters also trashed several shopping malls owned by Sun Hung Kai Properties, with New Town Plaza in Sha Tin bearing the brunt of it.
They destroyed facilities and harassed shop employees and customers.
In a statement, Sun Hung Kai Properties strongly condemned the violence.

Various brands lament labeling territories as separate countries,"Apologies from Coach, Givenchy, Asics follow Versace's regret over similar issue
Fashion brands Coach and Givenchy apologized on social media on Monday after Chinese netizens criticized them for selling clothes that mislabeled Hong Kong and Taiwan as separate countries, a day after Italian fashion house Versace apologized and lost its Chinese brand ambassador over a similar offense.
All three brands featured a similar design - a list of cities and countries - that listed Beijing and Shanghai as part of China. But Versace listed Hong Kong and Macao as separate nations on its design. Coach and Givenchy did the same thing with Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Images of these three brands' misprinted T-shirts recently went viral on Sina Weibo micro blogs in China.
Japanese sportswear manufacture Asics also apologized on Sina Weibo on Monday for inconsistent labeling as it listed Hong Kong and Taiwan as separate countries on its foreign-language websites, but placed the two regions under China on its Chinese website.
Chinese model Liu Wen said on her official Sina Weibo account that she had terminated her contract with Coach and strongly condemned its action for hurting the feelings of the Chinese people. Liu became Coach's brand ambassador on July 26.
""I want to apologize for the harm caused to everybody due to my indiscreet selection of brand to represent,"" she said. ""I love my country, and will adamantly safeguard China's sovereignty. National sovereignty and territorial integrity are sacred and cannot be violated under any circumstances.""
On Monday noon, the studio of Chinese singer-actor Jackson Yee, also known as Yi Yangqianxi, said in an online statement on Sina Weibo that he had terminated his cooperation with Givenchy Beauty, the fashion brand's perfumes and makeup line.
""We are extremely angry at Givenchy for designing clothing that is suspected of damaging China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" the statement reads. ""We have stopped all cooperation with Givenchy. Mr Yee and his studio resolutely uphold the one-China principle and adamantly safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.""
By Monday afternoon, Coach and Givenchy issued their apologies on Sina Weibo, saying they are sorry for the inaccuracies. The two brands also reiterated their respect for Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as their commitment to provide products and services to Chinese customers.
Coach posted an apology on its Twitter account, and Givenchy did the same on its Facebook page. Both said they have immediately pulled those products from all channels globally and will take measures to avoid similar mistakes in the future.
Experts said these controversies are particularly hurtful to Chinese people, especially while Hong Kong is embroiled in increasingly violent protests and while cross-Straits relations are facing growing uncertainties.
An editorial by People's Daily on Monday questioned the sincerity of the apologies by foreign companies. ""If they really learned their lesson, they shouldn't 'queue up' to cause trouble in questions related to Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.""
The editorial warned foreign companies not to undermine China's sovereignty, and China will take some ""defensive tools"" to deal with companies that violate its bottom line.
Zhu Songling, a professor at the Institute of Taiwan Studies at Beijing Union University, said while most countries recognize and respect the one-China principle, some countries have been trying to stir up trouble through official and unofficial means in Hong Kong and Taiwan for years.
""This puts foreign companies who wish to make money in China in a peculiar spot,"" Zhu said. ""Intentional or not, they must play along with the political rhetoric of their home countries or face scrutiny back home. This includes upholding naming conventions that may agitate Chinese customers.""
Last January, the Marriott hotel chain listed the Tibet autonomous region, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao as separate countries in their survey, resulting in its Chinese website and app being shut down for a week. Delta Air Lines and clothing stores Gap had also run into similar controversies by misrepresenting Chinese territories last year.
""Foreign companies know that if they want to make money in China, they must follow Chinese laws and maintain good relations with Chinese customers,"" Zhu said.
""They are often apologetic and willing to correct their mistakes if caught red-handed. Otherwise, there are not many other incentives for them to change their practices.""

HK's Lam condemns violence at protests,"Protesters surrounded Hong Kong's Legislative Council and government headquarters, blocked roads nearby and, according to the police, initiated a riot, in opposition to the city's extradition law amendments on Wednesday, throwing the city into chaos.
Different authorities appealed to the public to stay calm.
The special administrative region's chief executive, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, voiced strong condemnation of the violence during the protest.
She urged the people of Hong Kong to step away from violence. Lam appealed to the public to express their opinions in a rational, peaceful and lawful way.
In an interview on the same day with the city's leading broadcaster - Television Broadcasts Limited - she said she was ""saddened"" and ""worried"" by the clashes.
Young people may end up doing something they may regret, Lam said.
The chief executive said the government will press ahead with the amendments despite the violent demonstration.
Similar to the illegal ""Occupy Central"" movement in 2014, tens of thousands of masked protesters, in opposition to the extradition law amendments, occupied the main roads outside the government headquarters and the Legislative Council Complex in Admiralty, Hong Kong Island, despite repeated warnings by police to disperse.
There were serious disruptions to traffic and nearby business activities.
With protesters having blocked lawmakers' access to the LegCo building, the Legislative Council announced it would postpone the second reading of the amendments.
A government spokesman also issued a statement calling on the public to stay away from the area and remain calm.
The government proposed to revise the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance in Hong Kong to enable the city to surrender fugitive offenders to jurisdictions that have no long-term agreements with the SAR.
Hong Kong has fugitive surrender agreements with 20 jurisdictions and mutual legal assistance arrangements with 32 others. Such arrangements do not include the Chinese mainland, Macao and Taiwan.
In Beijing, the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Geng Shuang, reiterated the central government's firm support for the SAR government's proposal to amend the extradition law. Hong Kong's mainstream public opinion opposes any acts that will jeopardize the city's prosperity and stability, Geng said.
Violent clashes
The protest started in the early hours of Wednesday. Masked protesters, equipped with umbrellas and goggles, built metal barricades to confront police officers. Some protesters were seen prying bricks from the sidewalk.
A police statement released on Wednesday evening said protesters repeatedly charged police lines and engaged in life threatening acts including setting fires and attacking officers using bricks and sharpened iron poles.
They also grabbed and rearranged metal barricades set in front of the building. Tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper spray were used against protesters who stormed the line of police outside the building.
Some police officers were injured during the clashes. More than 20 protesters were injured and taken to hospitals.
Several public events were canceled. Some banks and stores in Admiralty and Wan Chai closed temporarily due to the demonstrations.
Commissioner of Police Stephen Lo Wai-chung strongly condemned the demonstrators' ""irresponsible"" conduct, which he said endangered the lives of the demonstrators and innocent people.
Lo urged them to stop clashing with police and occupying major roads of the city. He also called on the public to leave the area in an orderly manner for their safety.
The Colloquium of Six Religious Leaders of Hong Kong issued a statement on Wednesday, echoing the call for people to express their concerns through dialogue in a rational and peaceful way.
Hong Kong stocks tumbled on Wednesday as sentiments dimmed over a number of factors. The Hang Seng Index, the city's benchmark, dropped 1.73 percent, or 480.8 points, to close at 27,308.4 points on Wednesday.
The stock market's bullish momentum until Tuesday drove the equity gauge as high as 27,857 points.
Hong Kong developer Goldin Financial Holdings, citing economic uncertainty, walked away from a land deal in Kai Tak area of the city's Kowloon District, forfeiting its bid deposit of HK$25 million ($3.2 million).
Kwok Sze-chi, executive director of Bright Smart Securities, said that Goldin dropped the bid partly over worries about a potential lack of funding if they pursued the deal.

Overseas interests blamed for HK turmoil,"Ex-legislator targets US, 'pro-Taiwan independence' forces and liberal studies
The United States and ""pro-Taiwan independence"" forces are to blame for recent turmoil in Hong Kong, according to a former Hong Kong member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, who said links between the violent vandals and external forces have surfaced.
The observation by Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai, who served in the nation's top legislature, came after repeated protests over a now-suspended extradition bill in the past two months.
The ulterior motive is to throw Hong Kong into major turmoil, the former president of the Legislative Council told China Daily in an exclusive interview on Thursday.
""When Hong Kong is in a chaotic state, the US can unsettle China, while people from Taiwan in favor of independence will say 'one country, two systems' is not applicable to Taiwan because it is a failure in Hong Kong,"" Fan said.
""Due to the rapid rise of China, the US always sees China as a big threat. If Hong Kong is unsettled, the city will lose its functions of contributing to the nation's development, with the trade dispute being one of the US tactics to unsettle China.
""In addition, the US and other Western powers can criticize China for not doing well enough to maintain implementation of 'one country, two systems' unchanged for 50 years,"" she said.
Thus, Fan said it was not strange that some people from Taiwan were assisting and financing the violent protesters.
The city was in shock after masked radical protesters escalated violence on July 1 by storming into the city's legislature and vandalizing the complex, resulting in an early recess of the legislature and costing about HK$40 million to HK$50 million ($5.1 million to $6.4 million) to repair.
One of the lawless intruders, who took off his mask, was identified as a ""pro-Hong Kong independence"" graduate of the University of Hong Kong and reportedly fled to the US through Taiwan.
It was also reported by the media that a large group of violent rioters had fled to Taiwan to seek asylum shortly after July 1. Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen described them as ""friends from Hong Kong"" and said the Taiwan authorities would consider their applications for asylum on humanitarian grounds.
Fan said the violent protesters, who were manipulated by external influences, intended to provoke and test the bottom line of the central government by attacking the Legislative Council, the building of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR and defacing the national emblem.
The recent mayhem has also caused some to call into question liberal studies in the city.
In the wake of the violent attack on July 1, Tung Chee-hwa, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, China's top advisory body, called liberal studies a total failure.
The design of liberal studies is flawed, Fan said, since there are no syllabuses or textbooks. It is up to the teachers to prepare teaching materials for students, Fan said.
Currently, liberal studies is a compulsory subject and examinations also are required.
""If students want to make high marks, they must follow what the teachers teach them and adapt to the style of the examination papers. In case the liberal studies teachers have strong political inclinations, they will instill anti-China and anti-establishment ideas in the mind of students.""
Fan's worries have been backed by recent cases of several liberal studies teachers who were found to have posted messages full of hatred for the city's police force, according to reports. Some even cursed the children of police officers, reports said.
A veteran liberal studies teacher, Colin Lai, who was also chairman of the liberal studies committee at the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority, was accused of uploading anti-police messages on his social media page that read, ""The whole family of black cops should die"". After the case was reported, he resigned from the HKEAA but has not resigned from the school where he teaches.
Fan said Lai was the chairman of the liberal studies committee at HKEAA, giving him a big say over examination papers and grading.
""That's the reason why, after the reunification in 1997, Hong Kong students' affinity for the country has decreased,"" she said.

"Ignoring HK riots, US uses human rights to maintain hegemony","What the United States can truly lecture other countries on is how to master the art of using double standard. On Friday night, several hundred protesters took to the streets in New York City to protest alleged police brutality. Yet on the same day, President Donald Trump tweeted: ""NYC is getting dirty & unsafe again, as our great police are being disrespected, even with water dumped on them ...""
So what makes the New York demonstration different from the Hong Kong riots for Trump? Why are the violent demonstrations in Hong Kong a pursuit of democracy and human rights, and Hong Kong police's efforts to restore order and protect Hong Kong residents' rights a suppression of democracy? And why do Western media outlets keep distorting facts about the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region while justifying police action in the US, the United Kingdom and Spain to deal with protesters?
Even more ridiculously, the US House of Representatives passed the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act on Oct 15, linking Hong Kong's human rights and democratic conditions with the US' trade policy toward Hong Kong. Now the Senate is reviewing the act, through which the US Congress wants to interfere in China's Hong Kong affairs.
According to the act, if the US doesn't find the human rights and democratic conditions in the SAR to its liking during its periodical reviews, it could suspend its free trade agreement with Hong Kong.
The act is a ludicrous attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state. But then the US has always excelled in finding excuses to impose sanctions on other countries.
First, respect for each others' sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in other countries' international affairs are two of the basic principles of international law, which should be abided by all countries. But the US has always ignored international law as it considers itself the world police and self-appropriated the right to judge other countries using its own standards. Which makes the US an ugly global bully.
Hong Kong belongs to China. And the central government sticks to the promise of upholding the ""one country, two systems"" and providing space for ""Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong"" and granting it a ""high degree of autonomy"". So, as an outsider, the US has no right to interfere in Hong Kong's affairs, and the passing of the act is a blatant interference by the US in China's domestic affairs.
Second, although the House passed the act in the name of human rights and democracy, the US doesn't really care about those values. Instead, it is using so-called human rights as a diplomatic tool to impose increasing pressure on China. The human rights advocated by the US is not the same as stipulated in United Nation's Universal Declaration on Human Rights and widely recognized by international community, but a set of its own principles. And since nobody knows what the standards of the US' human rights are, it could interpret them to suit its own purpose.
Third, the US act confuses right with wrong, and encourages the rioters in Hong Kong to commit even more heinous acts. The US legislation wrongly describes the rioters' violent acts as a pursuit of democracy and human rights, and Hong Kong police's attempt to restore peace and order in the city as suppression.
For several months, the demonstrators have run riot in the SAR, damaging public facilities, impeding public services, attacking Hong Kong residents and police officers and disturbing people's normal life, which in simple terms are an infringement on people's human rights and freedom.
The so-called Hong Kong act is another example of the US trying to impose its hegemony. No wonder the Foreign Ministry spokesman has said China will resolutely oppose US hegemony and make more efforts, along with other developing countries, to maintain a fair world order.

HK pro-government lawmaker stabbed while campaigning,"Pro-establishment Hong Kong lawmaker Junius Ho Kwan-yiu was stabbed by a knife-wielding man while canvassing votes in Tuen Mun, New Territories, on Wednesday morning.
The attack renewed a growing call for the government to take necessary and effective efforts to ensure a fair and just District Council election, slated for Nov 24.
Ho, who was stabbed on the left side of his chest, was conscious when taken to Tuen Mun Hospital. Two more people from Ho's campaign team suffered injuries to their hands and arms in the attack.
Around 9 am, a man dressed in blue and holding a bouquet approached Ho as a supporter. He fished out a knife from his bag while pretending to look for his cell phone after he had asked Ho to pose for a photo with him. The assailant was subdued at the scene and subsequently arrested by police.
In a statement issued around 11 am, Ho described the attack as ""a dark moment"" in Hong Kong's District Council election. He said a spate of unlawful activities were impeding the electioneering of pro-establishment candidates but pledged to fearlessly continue his campaign.
The city has been haunted by protests, often violent, during the past five months.
Following the attack, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government stressed it has zero tolerance for violence.
A spokesperson for the SAR government said police would look into the attack and would strictly enforce the law to maintain law and order. Pointing out that Hong Kong had always been pluralistic and inclusive, the spokesperson said in a statement that people should be rational, peaceful and respectful when expressing opinions.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor condemned the attack. While in Beijing on Wednesday, Lam stressed the SAR government will make every effort to ensure a fair, safe and just election. Society as a whole should also step forward to oppose violent behavior that undermines the election, Lam said.
Ho is running for district councilor of Lok Chui, Tuen Mun. Lo Chun-yu and Chiang Ching-man are also vying for the seat.
The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Youth Association called the attack ""an overt challenge to Hong Kong's rule of law and election system"".
In a statement, the association said the attack was an outrageous crime that had not only endangered Ho and his election team, but also severely undermined the upcoming District Council election.
The association urged the SAR government and police to strictly enforce the law and keep candidates and their campaign teams safe so that a fair election could be held.
Stanley Ng Chau-pei, chairman of the Hong Federation of Trade Unions - the city's largest labor union - also decried the attack.
Ng said ""black terror"" will not hold back candidates who truly love the city and want to contribute to its development.
The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong said many DAB candidates had been harassed during electioneering. Some were besieged and had their offices broken into, set on fire and vandalized, DAB chairwoman Starry Lee Wai-king said.
Following the attack, the DAB met HKSAR Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung to discuss how to ensure a fair and safe election.
After the meeting, Lee said Cheung promised that the government would call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation.
Lee revealed that one of the party's candidates was also attacked on Wednesday morning. She called on the government to beef up security at voting booths on Nov 24 to guarantee that voters can cast their ballots freely.
Echoing Lee, lawmaker Martin Liao Cheung-kong said the government has a duty to ensure the safety of candidates contesting an election.
Also on Wednesday, about 30 people handed a petition letter to Chairman of the Electoral Affairs Commission Fung Wah, urging the commission to scale up efforts to ensure the personal safety of candidates, voters and election volunteers, as well as fair elections.
""The riotous attack is to wipe out righteous voices by deterring residents from voting freely,"" said local resident Fu Chun-chung at the EAC office building after Ho's attack.

Cathay Pacific complies with regulator's request,"Cathay Pacific Airways has submitted information about all crew members who fly in mainland airspace, meeting the requirements of China's aviation regulator, a senior official said.
Gu Xiaohong, deputy director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China's general affairs department, said at a news conference in Beijing on Thursday that Cathay Pacific had handed over the crew lists on time.
A statement issued by the administration on Aug 9 required the airline to share identification details of all aircrew on flights passing through mainland airspace from Aug 11. Cathay Pacific was told that without crew lists approved by the administration, flights would not be allowed to use mainland airspace.
The regulator also said that since Saturday, Cathay Pacific may not allow employees who had taken part in illegal protests, violent acts and overly radical activities in Hong Kong to work on flights to or from the mainland, or that enter its airspace.
On Wednesday, Cathay Pacific terminated two pilots, the company said in a statement on Sina Weibo, after it had previously suspended them over their involvement in protests in Hong Kong.
One is currently facing trial in relation to attacks on Hong Kong police during protests.
Cathay Pacific's delay in drawing clear lines with employees who supported the protest movement and took part in the illegal airport demonstration in Hong Kong angered netizens on the Chinese mainland.
""I hope Cathay Pacific will undertake more sincere actions than only talk the talk,"" Sina Weibo user Fuxinghao2017 wrote.
An industry expert said the company should step up control of radical staff and upgrade its security measures.
Lin Zhijie, an aviation industry analyst and columnist at Carnoc.com, a leading civil aviation website portal in China, said, ""Except for a few routes, most of Cathay Pacific's routes fly through mainland airspace, especially flights to the mainland, Europe and North America, which account for more than half of Cathay's revenue.""
If the company does not take serious measures to root out all radical employees and enhance internal safety controls and improve security, it might lose its advantage in the mainland market, he added.
Gu said the administration was making efforts to increase the transfer capacity of airports in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to avoid disruption to trips between the mainland and Hong Kong following recent disruptions at Hong Kong International Airport. It would boost flight capacity and make it easier for passengers to reschedule flights or get refunds, Gu added.

"Protests cause traffic snarls in HK, flights canceled, subway disrupted","Hong Kong was plunged into fresh chaos on Monday as a general strike followed another weekend of violent protests, paralyzing transportation networks and leading to numerous flight cancellations.
Commuters struggled to get to work on time on Monday morning, with many rail and bus services suspended. Some protesters blocked trains from leaving stations while others wedged themselves between train doors.
Nancy Huang, 23, a recruitment consultant and Tai Wai resident, said she had planned to reach her Wan Chai office before 8:30 am but was stuck at Tai Wai station long past that time. ""It's too inconvenient, and I feel so tired. The station was full of people, and I was trapped there for nearly 5 hours,"" she said.
Another Tai Wai resident, Susan Tso, 26, hadn't managed to reach her workplace at Sai Ying Pun even by 11:30 am. She had planned to clock in by 9:30 am but waited at the Tai Wai station for about one hour before deciding to look for a bus. ""There are still around a hundred people waiting ahead of me,"" Tso said.
""These protesters have no respect for other people, as many in Hong Kong don't want to strike. How can these protesters force others to, and who gives them the right?"" she added.
Long lines of traffic could be seen across Hong Kong Island leading into the heart of the business district, and hundreds of people were stranded at the airport. Roads into the city were paralyzed.
Ng, a 50-year-old office worker living near Central who didn't want to disclose his full name, endured a long commute to his Tsim Sha Tsui office as part of the subway's Tsuen Wan line had been blocked by protesters in the morning. He said the citywide strike had completely disrupted his work schedule.
A businessman surnamed Chan who took the subway from Tsim Sha Tsui to Central said the strike caused trouble for workers as most of the city's public transport system had come to a halt.
The citywide disruption has triggered condemnation from community groups. The city's biggest political party in the legislature joined the condemnation. Gary Chan Hak-kan, vice-chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, said the strike has blocked the city's main roads and disrupted subway trains, depriving citizens their rights to commute.
Chan added that his party understands that the protesters have the right to go on strike, but the people's right to travel to work on the city's transportation system should be respected.

West's meddling in HK root cause of violence,"Following the vandalizing of Hong Kong's legislature on Monday, Britain's Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt urged the city's authorities to understand the root causes of what happened which according to him was a deep-seated concern by people in Hong Kong that their basic freedoms are under attack.
Laying aside the facts that under the discriminatory British colonial rule the majority of Hong Kong's residents never enjoyed the freedoms they do today and that there was no right to take to the streets, and that Britain no longer has any responsibility for the governance of Hong Kong or any supervisory rights, let's do as he urged and look at the root causes of the violent protests.
Which is simply that the ideologues in Western governments never cease in their efforts to engineer unrest against governments that are not to their liking, even though their actions have caused misery and chaos in country after country in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
Now they are trying the same trick in China.
The aim is simple, as is the strategy: They are trying to exploit Hong Kong's different system and its proximity to the Chinese mainland to instigate unrest against the SAR government as a means to put pressure on the central government.
The city, a freewheeling commercial hub, would have escaped their attentions had it not been a high-profile special administrative region of the People's Republic of China, with a special dispensation for its different social and economic system to remain in place for a transition period after the return of sovereignty to China.
The root cause of the unrest, although they will never admit it, is that feeling growing anxiety about China's rise, the ideologues in the US and its acolytes feel compelled to try and contain it, and they are not wasting any opportunity to put pressure on it through inciting unrest in the SAR.
They have been the maneuverers behind the ""Occupy Central"" campaign in 2014, the Mong Kok riot in 2016 and the latest anti-government campaign riding on the controversy over the extradition law amendments. Indeed, it is now an open secret that some of the Occupy masterminds received special training from foreign forces before they kicked off the Occupy campaign in the fall of 2014.
The violent behavior that these Western agitators are emboldening tramples on the rule of law in Hong Kong and undermines its social order. But, of course, so long as it suits their purpose, they have no qualms about what the collateral damage might be.
Monday should have been a day to celebrate Hong Kong's return to the motherland, instead it was used by some as an excuse to tarnish the image of Hong Kong and to smear the central government."
Lam to start dialogue with HK residents,"HONG KONG - Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said on Tuesday that her government would immediately set up a platform to engage in a dialogue with Hong Kong residents of all backgrounds.
""All my principal officials and I are committed to listening to what the people have to tell us,"" she said. She hoped dialogue would facilitate mutual understanding and respect in a now-divided society and would help the city recover from its protracted chaos.
Starting this week, Lam said, talks would begin with organizations and people who gave practical advice to the government in the past three months.
Speaking to reporters before Tuesday's regular Executive Council meeting, Lam said she hoped the nonviolent weekend assembly, in which tens of thousands took part, indicated that peace was returning to the city.
Sunday's protest was the calmest since demonstrations against a now-shelved extradition amendment bill escalated in mid-June.
Lam said she remained convinced that Hong Kong has unique advantages in attracting overseas companies, and the government had been doing its best to ensure that the rule of law was being upheld and respected.
Earlier, the government commissioned the Independent Police Complaints Council to look into the cause and facts pertaining to the violent protests from June 9 to July 2 and to submit a report within six months.
Lam said the scope of the review would be extended to all mass protests, which began on June 9, as it was unclear when the turmoil was going to end.
As part of an exhaustive review, the independent council has set up a special task force for, among other things, fact finding, assessment of police procedures and making recommendations to prevent any reoccurrence. The report will be made public when ready.
To ensure objectivity, the independent council will also hire experienced foreign experts, including those who dealt with the unrest in United Kingdom in 2011, Lam said.
It will also look into complaints against police, including those pertaining to an incident in Yuen Long on July 21, when white-clad mobs indiscriminately attacked protesters, passengers and journalists in the subway station, Lam said.
Remarks slammed 
Also on Tuesday, the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region warned against wishful thinking that China would trade on its own territorial sovereignty and national unity.
The statement came after United States Vice-President Mike Pence said on Monday it would be harder for Washington to make a trade deal with Beijing if there was violence in the city.
China firmly opposes any country's attempt to use Hong Kong's prosperity and stability - as well as the well-being of over 7 million Hong Kong residents - as a bargaining chip, the office's spokesman said.
It said some US politicians have stuck to a Cold War mentality and its attendant hegemonic and zero-sum thinking. They are confusing right and wrong, making irresponsible remarks and violently interfering in China's internal affairs.
Also, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China is strongly dissatisfied by and firmly opposed to Canada's ""indiscreet remarks"", after Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland issued a statement on Hong Kong on Saturday.
Canada has repeatedly ""pointed fingers at"" Hong Kong affairs and brutally interfered in China's domestic affairs, disregarding China's solemn position, international law and the basic norms of international relations, Geng said in a daily news conference.
Hong Kong affairs are purely China's domestic affairs, in which no country, organization or individual is allowed to interfere, Geng said. ""Canada has no right to make presumptuous comments about Hong Kong affairs,"" he said, adding that any attempt to create chaos in Hong Kong will fail.
Canada should act cautiously over issues concerning Hong Kong to avoid further deterioration of its ties with China, already damaged by detaining Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, Geng said.

No unacceptable demands in HK dialogue,"Responding to the violent incidents in Hong Kong over the weekend, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, chief executive of the special administrative region, promised on Tuesday that her government will do its utmost to build a dialogue platform with the public.
It is a positive sign that the SAR government remains open to hearing public opinions and is still willing to have a dialogue with Hong Kong society. Yet it is sad that she had to reiterate the administration's zero tolerance toward violence and unlawful acts, due to the continuing attacks on police officers and the vandalizing of public facilities and stores over the weekend, despite the olive branch that has been offered.
Which means there is still a big gap between those disturbing public order and Lam's plan. A gap that appears to be unbridgeable, since her administration will by no means swallow the pills the demonstrators prescribe, as it will directly shake the foundation of the ""one country, two systems"" framework and threaten China's sovereignty over the city.
Which is why she stressed that the administration will not accept the demands of the demonstrators. Indeed, the demands are so divorced from the reality of Hong Kong being a special administrative region of China that one can't help but wonder what's their underlying motivation. Especially, given the double standard of countries such as the United States and Britain, which was once again displayed at the G7 summit.
Given the forceful responses to such rioting in these countries, her administration has been criticized in some quarters for adopting a pussyfoot approach to the disturbances. But restraint should not be mistaken for weakness.
The scale of the disruptions has downsized dramatically in recent days, as more and more Hong Kong people realize that genuine concerns are being hijacked by those intent on promoting agendas other than those that have the SAR's best interests at heart.
For any dialogue to be fruitful, it needs to involve only those who genuinely want the best for the city. Those who are simply intent on causing trouble or advocate criminal acts, for whatever reason, should be excluded.
The police should collect and analyze the video of the illegal protests and violent incidents over the past two months, and identify and hold accountable those who have committed any criminal acts. And to put an end to the chaotic situation, the city's courts should do their duty as the last defender of the rule of law and public order, and show no leniency when punishing those guilty of any law-breaking behavior.
All reasonable minds should know that sympathy with rioters only makes the sympathizers themselves the fuelers of further violence."
Common prosperity will help bridge the understanding gap,"Editor's note: Beijing rebuked Jeremy Hunt, the United Kingdom's foreign secretary, and Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong for their remarks about the violent protests in Hong Kong recently. China Daily writer Li Yang comments:
Beijing pointed out that the two had no ground on which to stand, since Hong Kong residents did not enjoy any democratic rights under British colonial rule.
However that fact does not help answer the question of why some of the protestors are seemingly nostalgic for the ""good old days"" of British rule when they were actually not entitled to any of those democratic rights they enjoy today. For instance, they could not choose the head of the administration, had no say over who made up the legislature and were even not allowed to take to the streets, all rights they have enjoyed since Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997.
Compared with the UK's colonial rule over Hong Kong - the British army occupied the Hong Kong Island on Jan 26, 1841 - the 22 years since 1997 is still a short time. More important, over those years, Hong Kong was transformed from an unknown spot in the mouth of the Pearl River to a pearl of Asia.
Naturally, Hong Kong residents took pride in this achievement and identified themselves as subjects of the world's strongest empire and attributed Hong Kong's prosperity to its colonial governance. Which means some of them have looked upon other parts of Asia, including the Chinese mainland, in a condescending way for a long time.
In contrast, people on the mainland firmly thinks that the handover marked the end of a humiliating chapter in Hong Kong's history, which should have made Hong Kong people, who are regarded as long-lost sons of the motherland, feel proud and elated. But in fact, many Hong Kong residents have felt confused and uncertain about their future back then.
The protests should remind Beijing to address the identity gap between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, which has long been covered up by patriotic narrations, and has been a source of the understanding deficit between Hong Kong residents and their mainland compatriots.
The ""one country two systems"" has been a means to ease the transition of Hong Kong's handover, but it will clearly take more, particularly time and further development, to awaken Hong Kong residents to the de-colonization of Hong Kong.
While building the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, a national development strategy, more platforms and opportunities should be created for the integrated development of the region, which will naturally deepen mutual understanding. It will take joint efforts of both sides to resolve Hong Kong's lingering identity crisis.

"HK people urged to unite to shut off violence, chaos","The situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has reached a severe point that draws concern over Hong Kong's future, said Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council.
Yang, speaking on Tuesday, called on Hong Kong people to unite in order to halt the violence and chaos and bring back order.
""The fate of Hong Kong will be decided by all Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots,"" said the spokesman for the country's top Hong Kong affairs authority in a news conference in Beijing.
""The radical protests that have continued for nearly two months are extremely serious in nature and have had very bad consequences. They have severely affected Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, pushing it into a dangerous abyss,"" Yang said.
During the protests, 461 people have been injured, including 139 police officers. A strike staged by protesters on Monday resulted in some 250 flights being canceled and service on eight subway lines being suspended for more than five hours, he said.
Last month, protesters smeared paint on China's national emblem. On Saturday, they removed the national flag from a flagpole and threw it into the harbor, an action they repeated on Monday. The flags have been recovered and raised.
""This is the crucial moment for us to stand firm and guard our beautiful homeland,"" said Yang, calling on Hong Kong residents to think calmly about who will suffer if the situation turns irremediable.
Yang also urged the HKSAR government, judicial organs and Hong Kong police to safeguard the rule of law and never go soft on lawbreaking violence.
""With no punishment for breaking the law, there would be no integrity of the law; without respect for the integrity of the law, the legal system would be nothing,"" he said.
He reiterated the need for respect for Hong Kong police for their ""resolute and just law enforcement"" and said they have ""the strong support of all Chinese"".
Yang said all who participated in violent and criminal activities will be held accountable in accordance with the law. ""Don't ever misjudge the situation and mistake our restraint for weakness,"" he said in a warning to criminals.
""Don't ever underestimate the resolve and strength of the central government and the Chinese people to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and safeguard the fundamental interests of the nation,"" he added.
""The central government has unswerving support for Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor. The opposition's attempt to force her to resign is doomed to fail,"" Yang said.
""We believe the HKSAR government and the Hong Kong police are fully capable of punishing violent crimes in accordance with the law and restoring social order,"" he said.
""In the Hong Kong's current chaos, those who stand at the front are a small number of violent radicals; in the middle are some citizens who have been misguided to join.""
Interference opposed 
""Anti-China forces inside and outside the city who have been trying to mess up Hong Kong are the behind-the-scenes masterminds who have bolstered illegal activities,"" Yang said.
""They have openly emboldened violent radicals, directed and funded them. They have called black white and played up fallacies, attempting to drag all Hong Kong residents into political wrangling.
""Since February, some Western politicians and Taiwan authorities have openly made a lot of irresponsible remarks to support the protesters and interfere in Hong Kong's affairs,"" Yang said.
They included United States House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who called the large demonstrations in Hong Kong ""a beautiful sight to behold"".
In response, the spokesperson for the Office of the Commissioner of China's Foreign Ministry in the HKSAR on Tuesday urged US politicians including Pelosi to stop openly supporting violent opponents of the law and interfering in China's internal affairs.
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Tuesday that any attempt to create chaos and undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability will be resolutely opposed by all the Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots.
The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, the largest political party in Hong Kong's Legislative Council, said in a statement that defending the rule of law is the only way to resolve current political disputes and stop the violence.
The alliance also called on the people of Hong Kong to speak up against violence and join the efforts to keep Hong Kong a safe place.
Lau Siu-kai, vice-president of China's leading Hong Kong affairs think tank, the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, said that the priority mission is to curb violence and restore social order. Without the rule of law, the government would not be able to deliver effective governance and improve economic and livelihood issues to ease social tensions, he added.
The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, one of the city's most international business organizations, said in a statement on Tuesday that the escalating violence has not only affected Hong Kong's reputation as an international financial center but also the small and medium-size enterprises, and most importantly has undermined the safety and livelihood of ordinary Hong Kong people.

"HK senior hit, killed by brick mourned","Some 30 residents in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on Friday mourned the death of a man, 70, who was struck by a brick that was thrown two days earlier, as violent protests continued to disrupt traffic and cause damage in the city.
A number of other people have been injured, some seriously - including a man who was recently set afire by radical protesters and remains hospitalized - since violent clashes and social unrest erupted in the city beginning in June.
On Friday afternoon, a public memorial ceremony was held in Sheung Shui for people to send their condolences for the passing of the elderly cleaner, who died in a hospital on Thursday night.
The victim was filming a conflict between rioters and people clearing barricades, according to Hong Kong police.
The case has been under investigation and classified as a homicide by authorities.
Some CCTV cameras around the scene were damaged by rioters, which caused difficulties in the investigation, Senior Superintendent Chan Tin-chu of New Territories North Regional Crime Headquarters said at a Friday news briefing. Chan pledged that police will pursue the case at all costs to bring the perpetrator to justice, and called on witnesses to come forward.
The SAR government expressed outrage over the malicious acts of rioters on Friday.
In a statement, the government's Food and Environmental Hygiene Department expressed profound sadness at the passing of the man and said it is now providing assistance to his family.
The Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR said the ""inhumane and indiscriminate atrocity"" is absolutely unacceptable. On Friday, the office said violence must be stopped immediately to avoid more injuries.
Expressing deep condolences, to the family of the deceased, the office reiterated its firm support for the SAR government and for the police to bring offenders to justice.
In London, police told local media on Friday that it is investigating an attack on Hong Kong's Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng Yeukwah. In a statement reported by Sky News, the Metropolitan Police said: ""A woman was taken to hospital by London Ambulance Service suffering an injury to her arm.""
In a statement, Cheng said radical protesters attacked her on her way to an event. She said she fell down and the mob shouted at her in Cantonese. She said she immediately filed a report with London Police and requested local authorities take the case seriously and bring the culprits to justice.
On Thursday, President Xi Jinping said the top task for Hong Kong is to bring violence and chaos to an end and restore order. Xi made the remark at the 11th BRICS Summit in Brazil Thursday.
Xi chose to make the statement at the BRICS Summit as it sends a message to the world that China is determined to stop the violence, said Hong Kong business tycoon Allan Zeman, chairman of the Lan Kwai Fong Group. He said Xi's words would reassure Hong Kong society on the central government's support for the HKSAR.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor on Friday expressed outrage at the attack on Cheng. Saying the attack was barbaric and violated the principles of a civilized society, Lam said the act should be strongly condemned. She expressed hope that local police will follow up on the case thoroughly to bring the offenders to justice.
In a daily news conference on Friday, the Foreign Ministry requested the United Kingdom immediately follow up on the case and bring the offenders to justice in order to safeguard the safety and dignity of all Chinese citizens in the UK.
The SAR government has set up an interdepartmental coordination team chaired by Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung to deal with the current social unrest and introduce more decisive measures to end the violence, Cheung said at a news conference on Friday.

HK parents march against US meddling,"Alliance condemns foreign entities for stirring up youth against extradition bill
Parents in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region took to the streets on Sunday to urge US politicians to not interfere with the SAR's extradition amendments and its internal affairs.
The protest, organized by several Hong Kong social groups, also condemned foreign entities for misleading young people in the city.
Among these social groups was an alliance of more than 30 local political, business and legal dignitaries who support the proposed amendments to the SAR's extradition law. They marched outside the US Consulate General in Hong Kong and Macao, calling on the US to stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs.
Stanley Ng Chau-pei, a member of the alliance, said it was despicable that some US politicians repeatedly interfered in the extradition law matter.
The protest echoed statements issued by the central government on Saturday, shortly after Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor announced the suspension of the proposed amendments to the SAR's extradition bill.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang emphasized in a statement that Hong Kong is part of China and its affairs are purely China's internal affairs, which brook no interference from any country, organization or individual.
The Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the SAR expressed in a statement on Saturday its strong disapproval of foreign entities' attempts to meddle in Hong Kong's internal affairs.
Ng, also a Hong Kong deputy to the National People's Congress, China's top legislature, added that foreign entities' colluding with some members of the Hong Kong opposition camp also incited the city's young people to participate in unlawful assembly that turned into violent clashes and a riot.
On Wednesday, tens of thousands of demonstrators paralyzed Hong Kong's core administrative and business area and halted the deliberation of the extradition bill in the Legislative Council. The clashes turned violent, with radical protesters hurling bricks, metal poles, planks and metal barricades at police in attempts to break into cordoned-off areas.
Eleven protesters were arrested on suspicion of unlawful assembly, assaulting police, disorderly conduct in a public place, and other riot-related offenses, according to the police.
Afterward, several universities in Hong Kong confirmed students had been arrested.
Presidents of 10 institutions of higher education in Hong Kong jointly issued a statement calling on all parties to remain calm and pay attention to their own and others' safety.
Ng said Hong Kong parents felt obliged to protect the SAR's young people from being ""taken hostage"" by political notions and drawn into violence that could break the law and ruin their futures.
Keung Suk-man, one of the parents among the protesters, denounced the opposition camp for calling for a strike by schools and teachers to oppose the extradition amendments. Such blatant incitement went against the school's principle of protecting students and training them to think independently, she added.
The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, the city's largest labor group, and the Association for Family Reunions also joined Sunday's protest outside the US Consulate General in Hong Kong and Macao.

US House bill on HK spurs strong protest from Beijing,"The United States House of Representatives' passage on Tuesday of the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 has sparked strong opposition from China, which said it will take countermeasures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests.
""If the relevant act were to become law, it would not only harm China's interests and China-US relations, but would also seriously damage US interests,"" said Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang in an online statement on Wednesday.
Geng said that the US House ignored the facts and called black ""white"" by referring to serious crimes like arson, vandalism and assaults on police as issues of human rights and democracy.
""It fully revealed the double standards the US applies, the hypocrisy of some people in the US on human rights and democracy, and their evil intentions to undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and contain China's development,"" he said.
He urged the US to clearly understand the situation, immediately stop advancing the act and stop meddling in Hong Kong's affairs, which are China's internal affairs.
According to a statement issued on Wednesday by the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the passage of the bill by the US House openly encourages opposition and radical forces in Hong Kong, tests the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle and tramples upon international law and basic norms governing international relations.
In the name of ""human rights and democracy"", some politicians in the US have attempted to undermine Hong Kong's role as an international finance, trade and shipping center, intimidated the just forces committed to stopping violence and ending chaos and provided shelter for violent extremists in Hong Kong, the statement said.
The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council and the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress also issued condemnations of the act on Wednesday.
Jon R. Taylor, chair of the University of Texas at San Antonio's department of political science and geography, told China Daily that the bill's consequences will likely be economic and cultural - with reduced opportunities for US investment and fewer US tourists.
Taylor said a stable Hong Kong serves everyone's interests, and the US should be concerned that the increasing acts of violence will only lead to greater chaos.
Mike Wong, vice-president of the San Francisco chapter of Veterans for Peace, said, ""We oppose any interference by elected US lawmakers to spend US tax dollars to support the illegal protesting in Hong Kong.""
Wong's organization is leading a petition calling on US lawmakers to end interference in Hong Kong and pay attention to domestic problems such as homelessness, inadequate healthcare, housing and gun violence.
Lawrence Ma Yan-kwok, chairman of the Hong Kong Legal Exchange Foundation, said, politically, Hong Kong provides an angle for the US to make up a story or excuse to condemn China or possibly seek international condemnation. In addition, Ma said the act is a way for the US government to divert public attention from its own political or policy deficiencies.

Speech moves diplomats to condemn violence,"GENEVA - Diplomats from various countries responded positively to the speech delivered Wednesday by Pansy Ho Chiuking, chairwoman of the Hong Kong Federation of Women, at the 42nd session of the United Nations Human Rights Council.
They also joined the Hong Kong NGO representative in condemning violent demonstrators in Hong Kong and called for calm and normal social order in the special administrative region.
In her speech, Ho condemned the ""increasingly escalating violent acts"" in the Chinese city and called for the international community to reprimand the organizers and influencers and help to stop the promotion of hatred and violent extremism, which can only ""leave irreparable scars to forever strip our beloved city of harmony and stability.""
Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, who was in Geneva to address the UN rights body session, told Xinhua that ""people should respect the law and not create a disordered situation"" that will ""undermine the environment of investment and peace and tranquillity in Hong Kong.""
Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun, permanent representative of Myanmar to the United Nations Office at Geneva, said, ""We should condemn any violent acts there.""
""What is happening in Hong Kong is an internal affair of China, and the principles of non-selectivity, objectivity, non-politicization and, very importantly, non-interference in the internal affairs of another country should be respected,"" the ambassador said.
Jorge Valero, Venezuela's permanent representative to the UN in Geneva, expressed ""the most robust rejection of the acts of violence perpetrated in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in recent weeks.""
He said these are ""events openly promoted by foreign interests to damage the internal order, public security and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China.""
Sitsangkhom Sisaketh, Lao deputy permanent representative to the UN in Geneva, said the Hong Kong demonstrations have not been peaceful and that they undermine the SAR's security and economy.
""I think that the international community will have a better understanding of what has been happening in Hong Kong through the statement of the representative of the Hong Kong Federation of Women,"" he said.
""The violent protests in Hong Kong have drawn the attention of the international community, as the majority of Hong Kong people have been affected. Their safety is under a threat posed by protesters,"" he said.
Mao Junxiang, executive director of the Center for Human Rights Studies at China's Central South University, who was in Geneva to attend the UN meetings, said the Hong Kong protests ""surpassed the scope of peaceful demonstrations and have seriously undermined the social order, endangering Hong Kong.""

"SAR offers help to protest-affected firms, individuals","The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government announced a series of relief measures worth HK$19.1 billion ($2.44 billion) on Thursday to offer support after the city said it now expects 2019 economic growth to be up to 1 percent from 2 to 3 percent previously.
The move comes at a difficult time as worries of a possible recession and waves of anti-extradition law protests weigh on sentiment, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po said at a news conference on Thursday.
The measures are intended to ""relieve the burden"" on struggling enterprises and help citizens ""maintain confidence"" in the local economy which will hopefully boost Hong Kong's economic output by 0.3 percent, Chan said.
The city's top financial official plans to introduce a one-off household electricity bill subsidy of HK$2,000, a one-off grant of HK$2,500 for kindergarten, primary and secondary school students, a one-month rent waiver for public apartments and one month's worth of extra payouts for welfare recipients.
Taxes will be decreased for a large segment of the population.
More than 340,000 small and medium-sized enterprises in the SAR, which account for over 98 percent of businesses and employ about 45 percent of the private-sector workforce, are bearing the brunt of the recent social unrest and will be lent a helping hand, Chan said.
Government fees and charges across 27 categories will be waived for 12 months. To help SMEs face liquidity problems, guaranteed loans under the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme will be provided.
The basket of measures will be carried out ""as soon as possible"", the announcement said. While measures like waivers for public housing rents could be implemented as early as October, some ""big ticket items"" need to get approval from the Legislative Council before being put into practice.
""The relief measures were not meant to solve the political crisis facing the government, but served as a way to take precautions as challenges loom large,"" Chan said.
He urged Hong Kong citizens to ""take a breath"" and focus on restoring the city's economy, adding that protesting is not a ""solution"", but only leads to ""additional harm"" and ""escalates tension among people"".

HK dignitaries decry protests by journalists,"News briefing nixed after helmet-clad reporters refuse to obey rules or leave
Reporters must keep an objective stance and respect others when carrying out their duties, local dignitaries said after the Hong Kong Police Force had to cancel its regular news conference for the first time since anti-government protests erupted in June.
The remarks came after six journalists attending the conference wore helmets with antagonistic slogans against the police and disrupted the work of other media reporters. The six accused the police of using excessive force during its operations and lying to the public.
The protest came even before Tse Chun-chung, chief superintendent of Police Public Relations Branch, could make his opening remarks. The six journalists - from Ming Pao, Stand News, RTHK, AM730 and Initium - showed they had no intention of leaving or taking off their helmets despite the moderator repeatedly asking them to respect the rules or leave.
After a nearly 20-minute standoff, Ko Chun-pong, superintendent of the Hong Kong Police Public Relations Branch, announced the cancellation of the conference and made the scheduled news briefing in a Facebook live video.
Wilkie Ng Wai-kei, chairman of the Hong Kong Police Inspectors' Association, denounced the journalists' behavior as ""unprofessional"" and ""unacceptable"".
Journalists should be unbiased during interviews and not ""hijack"" a police news conference to express their personal dissatisfaction over certain issues, Ng said.
He said the police should provide guidelines for reporters attending police briefings and prohibit those who disobey the guidelines from attending the news conferences.
Rebecca Chan Hoi-yan, an incumbent legislator and a former journalist, also criticized the protesting reporters. ""It is not the scene people would like to see, that a news conference was canceled due to protests by reporters,"" she said.
She added that the public wants to know about the police's latest operational strategies and explanations of recent incidents, and the news conference is the key platform.
Given the distrust and conflicts between front-line reporters and police, reporters should consider whether their expression could solve the problem or help ease tensions. If it is not helping, the reporters have to find other ways, Chan said.
She said that while journalists do have freedom of speech, their expression should not interfere with the rights of other journalists to carry out their duties. She suggested the journalists consider times before or after a news conference to express their opinions or hold their own media briefings.
Chan had worked as a reporter and TV anchor for TVB from 1998 to 2005 and a news editor for Now TV from 2005 to 2012. She recalled that back then, the police public relations branch, senior management of local media and journalists would sit together to share their needs and concerns, which helped them to understand each other better.
The city's senior officials have also voiced concerns over media operations in recent protest-related incidents.
In an exclusive interview with China Daily last week, Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu questioned the professionalism of some local reporters.
""I think some reporters have not been objective in reporting the incidents,"" Lee said. ""Some have already taken personal stances on some of the issues."" Moreover, in some cases, violent protesters were shielded by a large number of people wearing media vests.
He called for mutual respect between the media and the police. Neither side should conduct their jobs in a way that detracts from the duties of the other side, Lee said.
The news conference protest occurred after radicals vandalized the Hong Kong headquarters of Xinhua News Agency last weekend.
Police will not tolerate any form of violence and harm, regardless of one's motive and political stance, and will investigate fully to bring all offenders to justice, said Tse, who leads the police force's PR branch.
He also stressed that no one is in any position to make excuses for the rioters' violence.
The police have arrested 325 people between the ages of 14 and 59 since Nov 1. Charges include unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapons, assaulting police officers and possession of arms and ammunition without licenses.
During the protests, which have persisted for more than five months, 460 sets of traffic lights have been damaged, 45,000 meters of roadside railings have been dismantled, and 145 MTR and light rail stations have been vandalized, according to Tse.
""Rioters' destructive acts serve no purpose other than to vent their anger and grievances, real and imagined,"" Tse said. ""Continuing this rampage is a lose-lose situation for Hong Kong.""

Learning from Belfast to end HK troubles,"Thousands of angry people swarm into the streets. They believe they have legitimate grievances. They call on the government to repel or take certain measures and address their grievances.
Yet after the government resolves the initial issue, the demonstrations and violence do not end; they only spread and intensify. There are calls for democracy where none, it is argued, has been seen before. In some countries, the film footage and simple direct slogans attract widespread support for the rioters.
The riots have become more violent. The police have come under increasing strain.
This is Hong Kong in August 2019?
But this is also an exact description of the rising violence between two bitterly distrustful religious communities that I witnessed on the streets of my native Belfast in British-ruled Northern Ireland exactly - uncannily - half a century ago as a teenager in that unforgettable, agonizing August of 1969. The lessons I learned then would serve the people of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region well today before they bring an unimaginable disaster upon themselves.
Violent protests against authorities never bring peace. They only bring war, destruction and suffering - almost always on a scale that none of the demonstrators could have imagined when they took to the streets. Prosperity never follows violent protests. At best, there is mass unemployment and despair as local businesses and national investment flee the territory - a process which could continue for decades. You do not build factories and hire workers when those factories could be razed in one of the endless clashes.
The ""freedom"" the demonstrators in Hong Kong have been demanding is illusory. It is fool's gold. It is the mythical pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. This kind of ""freedom"" will never benefit the people of Hong Kong. At best it could be granted, but at the cost of a serious decline in investment from both the Chinese mainland and other regions of Asia.
Hong Kong's enormous advantage for decades, including the past two decades under Chinese autonomous rule, has been that it is considered a secure, predictable and safe place to do business with the mainland and with the wider region. But that no longer seems true. The longer the protests rage and the wider and more serious they become, the more that incalculable advantage will be eroded.
When I was a young boy, Belfast was still the largest ship building center on earth. In the late 1960s, the British government invested in two gigantic gantry cranes called Goliath and Samson - at the time the largest such pieces of machinery in the world - to build super oil tankers. They still stand today as tourist attractions, looming 32 and 35 floors high over the city. But they were never used industrially. Not once. The Northern Irish Civil War (known with masterly understatement as ""The Troubles"") saw to that.
The great shipyard that at its peak employed 35,000 workers became an industrial wasteland peopled only by ghosts. Even after peace finally returned to Northern Ireland, after 30 years of civil strife, the great complex on Queen's Island never recovered, never revived.
Hong Kong should avoid such a scenario in which growth and prosperity will wither and die. The Civil War in Northern Ireland raged - sometimes horrifically, sometimes more subdued - for 30 years until the landmark Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998. Today, United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suicidal obsession with pushing through a rapid, ""hard"" Brexit, threatens to negate 20 years of peace and trigger a new era of conflict and war on my native island.
The miserable British record of contempt for human rights, torture, intrigue and suppression in Northern Ireland gives the UK no right to hold itself up as any kind of example to lecture China today on how to handle the protests sweeping Hong Kong.
On the contrary, the residents of Hong Kong should ignore the fake-sweet words of compassion and support coming out of the UK and the United States to urge them to more extremes, more violence. That is a path that can only lead to generations of death, despair and ruin.
There is still time to draw back and reject that terrible path - before it is too late.

"Preservation of national identity in Hong Kong crucial, official stresses","National identity should never be abandoned no matter how society develops or how individuality prevails because patriotism always involves a higher value of life, a leading official of Beijing's top representative body in Hong Kong said on Wednesday.
Lu Xinning, deputy director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, made the remark when addressing a ceremony in celebration of the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, noting that Hong Kong is facing the ""severest situation"" since its return to the motherland.
Lu's call came at a time when some local protesters waved national flags of Great Britain and the United States during recent demonstrations while defiling the national flags of their own.
She said the patriotic spirit of the country's founders should have a place in the fast-changing society, however much the freedom of expression is valued.
Hong Kong people share the same developmental interests and cultural affiliation as their mainland compatriots, Lu said. She appealed to the city's youths to calm down and reflect on how to build a better city and a better country together.
The past two months have witnessed tens of thousands of young people taking to the streets in opposition to the government's handling of a now-suspended extradition bill. Hundreds of them were arrested for their involvement in violent demonstrations, according to Hong Kong police.
Experts have suggested that the lack of proper national education is to blame. Since 2007, the Hong Kong government has sought to introduce national education courses to strengthen students' ""national identity awareness"", but this attempt drew wide public opposition and was withdrawn.
Lu said she understood that young people love freedom. However, the freedom Hong Kong people pursue should not include the freedom of bullying and destroying, she said.
She cited a recent incident of online bullying of local police officers and their families, as well as vandalism to public facilities and private properties seen during protests.
Lu reiterated the central government's support for the HKSAR government and the police to bring back peace and order, following the chief executive's appeal for a dialogue platform to find a way out of the political impasse.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, who also attended the ceremony on Wednesday, said the government will resolutely safeguard ""one country, two systems"" and the rule of law in the event of escalating violence in protests.
She stressed the SAR government has the confidence to restore law and order.
Separately, the city's police force also appealed to the Hong Kong public to stand firm against violence. ""These radical protesters are tearing our society apart, and tearing down our core values, including rule of law,"" said Tse Chun-chung, chief superintendent of the police public relations branch.
It would be hard to imagine how society will turn out if the situation continues unchecked, according to Tse, who added that the rioters' acts can be best described as ""reckless and ruthless"".

Lam withdraws HK extradition bill,"SAR chief executive says move will help city initiate dialogue, break impasse
Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, announced on Wednesday the withdrawal of the already suspended extradition amendment bill, in a bid to help the city, which has been wracked by violence for nearly three months, initiate dialogue and move forward.
Announcing the decision in a televised speech, Lam stressed that the move was to fully allay public concerns. Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu will submit a motion to officially withdraw the bill when the Legislative Council resumes.
The chief executive also announced a number of measures to help break the city's political impasse.
Among them is the appointment of two new members of the Independent Police Complaints Council, a long-established watchdog for the city's police force. They are Barrister Paul Lam Ting-kwok, former chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association, and Helen Yu Lai Ching-ping, a senior civil servant who has held various public offices.
Lam also pledged that from this month, she and other senior government officials will start a direct dialogue with people from all walks of life with different stances and backgrounds.
She also promised to invite community leaders, professionals and academics to independently examine and review society's deep-seated problems and make suggestions on solutions.
Lam noted that the protesters' discontent extends far beyond the extradition bill to include various deep-rooted problems. It reflects the desire for the public to become more engaged in government decisionmaking, she added.
Yet she also stressed that violence will never be a solution and the government will strictly enforce the law against all violent and illegal acts. Lam appealed to residents to replace conflicts with conversations and seek solutions to get out of the impasse.
The anti-extradition protests have devolved into violence and vandalism, creating mayhem in the city.
In February, the government proposed to amend the city's two extradition laws - the Fugitive Offenders and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters ordinances - in a bid to enable Hong Kong to surrender fugitive offenders on a case-by-case basis to other jurisdictions that have no formal long-term agreements with the SAR. The bill was suspended in June, and Lam later said that ""the bill is dead"".
On Aug 20, Lam said the government's plan was to establish an ""open"" and ""direct"" dialogue platform with cross-sector representatives to jointly seek ways for Hong Kong to move forward.

HK govt seeks LegCo's assistance to address socio-economic issues,"Hong Kong Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, on Sunday called on the city's legislators to support the government's efforts in addressing the deep-seated social and economic problems that have fueled public discontent.
Such efforts will form the basis of Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor's Policy Address, scheduled to be presented before the Legislative Council on Wednesday, the city's No 2 official wrote in his weekly blog.
LegCo will reopen next week following the completion of repair work on its building after it was seriously vandalized by radical protesters on July 1.
A harmonious relationship between the executive branch and the legislature is key to effective administration, Cheung wrote, adding that government was striving to improve public benefits in a joint effort with lawmakers.
The policy initiatives to be spelled out in the address will center on deep-rooted societal issues in a bid to improve people's livelihoods and bring the city forward from the protracted violence and chaos, Cheung wrote.
In his Sunday blog, Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po pledged to offer more measures to support enterprises and employees affected by the protracted unrest and the consequent economic depression.
On the same day, Hong Kong Secretary for Labour and Welfare Law Chi-kwong hinted in his blog that the address will include some female-friendly measures covering employment, health and family relationships in these difficult times.
Elderly Commission Chairman Lam Ching-choi, who is also a nonofficial member of Hong Kong's Executive Council, said on Sunday that the address is also expected to include measures that will further alleviate the hardship of low-income groups.
Lam said he expects there will be an improvement to the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance Scheme and an increase in the Old Age Living Allowance.
Stanley Ng Chau-pei, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, the city's largest labor group, said he hopes the government will show more resolve in efforts to break up monopolies that have a major impact on people's livelihoods, especially those in land and housing.
Ng said that, in the long-run, such efforts will help control skyrocketing housing prices and improve people's quality of life.
He called for lawmakers' assistance in government endeavors. He said the opposition camp may intensify disruption of government-proposed bills, which may further slow the recovery of society. He called for all sectors to put aside political disputes and prioritize the well-being of all Hong Kong people.
Besides livelihood concerns, political wrangling still prevails in the city.
On Sunday, the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region condemned United States senator Ted Cruz's remarks regarding Hong Kong's ongoing violent protests.
Such remarks had openly trampled upon international law and basic norms governing international relations, a spokesman for the office said.
During a brief visit to Hong Kong, Cruz accused Hong Kong police of using excessive force and alleged the Chinese government was deploying agents to cause violence. He also insisted that he had never heard or seen evidence of rioting, vandalism or mob attacks during the monthslong unrest in the city.
All Chinese people including Hong Kong compatriots are resolutely against provocations by lying politicians like Cruz and are rock-solid in defending national sovereignty and security along with Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, the spokesman said.
""We urge Cruz and his ilk to take off their black clothes and remove their black hand from Hong Kong affairs,"" the spokesman said. ""China's territory is not somewhere they can run wild.""

Vice-premier urges HK to halt violence,"Vice-Premier Han Zheng on Wednesday said that ending the violence that has gripped Hong Kong for nearly five months remains the special administrative region's top priority and is the shared responsibility of the SAR's executive, legislative and judicial authorities.
Han said the central government will continue its unswerving support for the SAR government and its police force to end the violence, and restore the city's law and order, as ""no country or region in the world"" would tolerate such extremely destructive acts.
Han, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, made the remarks during a meeting with Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor in Beijing on Wednesday.
It was the first public meeting between Han and Lam since the protests broke out in June. It followed President Xi Jinping's meeting with Lam in Shanghai on Monday, in which Xi affirmed Lam's work in dealing with the unrest, and expressed confidence in her administration.
In Han's opening remarks before a closed-door meeting, he reaffirmed the central government's high degree of trust in and appreciation for Lam, as well as confidence in the SAR government and the Hong Kong Police Force in dealing with what he described as the ""most severe situation"" since the city's return to the motherland.
Bottom line 
He said radical separatists' disruptive acts have trampled the city's rule of law and challenged the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle, undermining the overall interests of Hong Kong.
Stressing that ending the violence should be the consensus of the whole of society, Han also expressed confidence in Lam's administration in taking effective measures to resolve housing and other livelihood issues.
The SAR government will always have the central government's firm support in maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, Han said.
He also pointed to the decision passed during just-concluded Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, in which the Party emphasized the importance of strictly upholding the national Constitution and the Basic Law in governing the HKSAR, as well as establishing a legal system in the SAR to safeguard national security. It shows the central government's unswerving stance and confidence in implementing the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Han said.
Expressing thanks for the central government's firm support, Lam pledged that the SAR government will firmly uphold the ""one country, two systems"" principle and the rule of law to stop the violence.
Lam said she's very saddened to see that one-third of the over 3,000 arrested during the protests are students and that the financial hub's positive momentum in economic development is undergoing a heavy blow. She said the SAR government is determined to end the violence and provide a peaceful environment.
Also attending the meeting were State Council Executive Deputy Secretary-General Ding Xuedong, Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council Zhang Xiaoming, and Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR Wang Zhimin.
Shared responsibility 
Hong Kong Barrister and Legislator Priscilla Leung Mei-fun agreed that the city's executive, legislative and judicial organs share responsibility in quelling violence. She said the work of those bodies is never separated in city governance. Under the spirit of the Basic Law, the three parties should complement each other and maintain checks and balances on each other's functions, she added.
Given the protracted violence, concerted efforts from the whole of society, especially from the three governing forces, are much needed in bringing Hong Kong back on track, Leung said.
Lau Siu-Kai, vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, a leading think tank on Hong Kong affairs, said recognition from the central government will help boost the morale of the embattled police, supporting them in withstanding social unrest.
Appreciating the central government's resolution to maintain ""one country, two systems"", Leung urged the SAR government to put greater emphasis on ensuring the public has a correct understanding of the policy.
She said the unrest has shown that some Hong Kong people, including youngsters, civil servants and judicial officers, lack a thorough and comprehensive understanding of the concept's essence.

Patten not in the position to talk about HK affairs,"Once again, Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, has exhibited his signature hypocrisy concerning Hong Kong.
In an anti-China article published in Financial Times, Patten emphasized Britain's ""obligations to Hong Kong"" according to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, whereas, in fact, any British obligations ended with the resumption of China's sovereignty in 1997.
What Patten was trying to do was to justify and glorify the violence of some of the recent protests against the extradition law amendment, to project the illusion that Britain is the protector of the ""freedom"" and ""well-being"" of residents in the special administrative region. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Since its return to China, Hong Kong enjoys more democracy and freedom than any time in the 155 years of British rule thanks to the Basic Law.
For example, all of the 28 Hong Kong governors, Chris Patten included, were appointed by the British monarch, and they monopolized both the executive and legislative powers. And Hong Kong residents had no say in any affair concerning the governance of the city.
But after 1997, democracy has progressed by leaps and bounds over merely two decades: The SAR's CE is now elected by a highly-representative selection committee; and half of its 70-member legislature are now elected directly, the remainders indirectly.
All Hong Kong residents now enjoy a wealth of civil and political rights they couldn't have imagined before 1997. These include, among others, freedom of expression, freedom of speech and freedom of the press, as evidenced in the recent events surrounding the extradition law amendment controversy.
Patten's claim that ""the UK has every right to discuss with China what is happening in its former colony"" is both outrageous and preposterous. The British snatched Hong Kong from China at the point of a bayonet and gun to ""punish"" the country for refusing to allow the British to sell opium to the Chinese people. Patten is saying the bandits should have a say in how to dispose of the stolen goods after they are recovered via due process.
Patten painstakingly argued that ""it would be nice to think...that it (Britain) still understands how to behave with integrity"". Unfortunately, he has demonstrated that it doesn't by refusing to rid himself of his colonial delusions - more than two decades after he left Hong Kong. Since that day he has never wasted a single opportunity to advance his China-bashing career, simply because he bears a grudge against Beijing after his humiliating failure in setting up political institutions that would allow the British to continue to have a say in Hong Kong affairs through their proxies in the city.
Time marches on, but there are always those like Patten who are unable to keep up."
Western reporters covering HK protesters need a reality check,"The gruesome scene of Fu Guohao, a Global Times reporter, being searched, tied up, humiliated and beaten up by Hong Kong protesters, or more precisely a mob, on Tuesday was broadcast live by many Western news channels. Only that while broadcasting it the channels identified Fu as a Hong Kong police undercover, until Hu Xijin, editor of the Global Times, tweeted that Hu is a reporter for the paper.
So far, I have not heard any Western journalists or news outlets condemning the brutality against a fellow journalist. The Voice of America, a US government-funded organization, refuses to acknowledge the basic fact, saying in its report that VOA cannot verify Fu's identity as a reporter. But it did not raise such a question when it called Fu a police undercover.
That many Western journalists covering the Hong Kong protests already reached a ""verdict"" before even going to the scene is nothing new. To them, China and the Chinese government are always wrong while the opposite side, whoever it may be, is always right. Talk about inherent prejudice.
Reporters should be impartial and objective, which is not the case with many reporters working for Western media. When Bruno Macaes of advisory firm Flint Global tweeted Fu's gruesome video on Tuesday, he was derided by Matthew Karnitschnig, Politico's chief Europe correspondent, saying: ""So whose side are you on?"" Like Karnitschnig, many journalists have taken sides while covering the Hong Kong protests, making objective reporting impossible.
That is why unlawful acts like the storming of the Hong Kong Legislative Council building on July 1 when mobs shattered glass doors, spray-painted graffiti on the walls and ransacked the LegCo complex were portrayed by many Western media outlets as heroic acts. They did the same when mobs threw petrol bombs at Hong Kong police recently.
Despite broadcasting the scene of a mob beating up a policeman and pinning him to the ground at the Hong Kong airport on Tuesday, Sky News ran a misleading caption, saying ""a police officer pulled a gun on protesters in violent confrontation at Hong Kong airport"", contradicting what the video clip showed. Viewers, however, are not blind.
Western media's description of the law enforcement action by the Hong Kong police as ""police brutality"" was the most bizarre news reporting. Having covered the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York and other US cities and the Yellow Vest protests in Paris, I was surprised to see the excessive restraint exercised by the Hong Kong police, which have been ranked high for their professionalism for a long time.
If it were the New York Police Department, real shots would have been fired and hundreds, if not thousands, of the protesters arrested. I was on Brooklyn Bridge on Oct 1, 2011, when more than 700 Occupy Wall Street protesters were handcuffed and taken away because they were marching in the car lane, instead of the pedestrian sidewalks.
I cannot imagine the NYPD, Washington DC police or the London police not using force to restrain protesters storming the JFK Airport, Reagan National Airport or Heathrow Airport.
I still remember an NYPD officer yelling at me and several other journalists covering the Occupy Wall Street movement that if we stepped off the sidewalk again, he would immediately arrest all of us despite wearing press badges.
It is true that the political bias in the US and some other countries has made it hard for many Western journalists to report about China objectively. But that is no excuse for distorting facts and failing to show solidarity with a fellow journalist beaten up by a mob.

Hong Kong people should reject violent radicalism,"Social harmony and stability have been crucial to sustaining the social development and economic vitality of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. These are now at risk of being undermined by the controversies surrounding changes to the SAR's extradition laws.
This explains why Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor decided on Saturday to suspend the legislative process for amendments proposed by the SAR government to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance.
The unwarranted political wrangling and violent radicalism are harmful to Hong Kong, and will inflict serious damage not just on social stability but also the economy, as evidenced by the seriously adverse consequences of the ""Occupy Central"" in the autumn of 2014.
Business activities in the first month of the 79-day Occupy demonstration dropped at the fastest pace in three years, with the HSBC Hong Kong Purchasing Managers' Index - a survey of business conditions - falling to 47.7 in October from 49.8 in the previous month.
While estimates of the total economic losses caused by the protest campaign vary, they are calculated to have been hundreds of billions of Hong Kong dollars, HK$350 billion ($44.7 billion) in the reckoning of Professor Francis Lui of the University of Science and Technology, for instance.
Already, the violent protests against the proposed amendments to the SAR's extradition laws are taking their toll on Hong Kong's asset markets, with the local stock market tumbling and home sales declining over the past couple of weeks. While official figures are yet to be made available, economists and analysts already fear they are having a negative impact on the real economy.
Amid the uncertainty brought about by a worsening global economic situation and the on-going trade conflicts between the Chinese mainland and the United States, the SAR's two biggest trading partners, the social turmoil is only inflicting unnecessary suffering on the SAR's economy and local residents.
The manufactured radicalism that has brought people onto the streets is dividing Hong Kong society and damaging the city's reputation for law and order. The last thing hard-working Hong Kong people want to see is the squabble over the proposed rendition law amendments being hijacked by people who have an axe to grind with China and are trying to make young people unwitting pawns in their attempt to advance their own agenda at the expense of Hong Kong society's overall interests, as well as those of the nation."
"For HK, one-country is the bottom line","The report of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2017 says ""one country, two systems"" is the best way to resolve Hong Kong-and Macao-related issues left over from history, and the best system that guarantees the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao. Which shows the commitment of the CPC and central government to the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
But in June this year, demonstrators in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region resorted to violence to protest the proposed amendment to the SAR's extradition law. Worse, they have escalated the violence despite the SAR government withdrawing the amendment bill.
On July 21, the protesters vandalized the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong SAR, and dishonored the national emblem. On Aug 3, the violent protesters removed the national flag from a flagpole near the Tsim Sha Tsui Star Ferry Pier and tossed it into the Victoria Harbor. And on Aug 5, they paralyzed Hong Kong's traffic forcing Hong Kong people to inadvertently support their strike.
By unleashing the wave of violence, the protesters have not only undermined Hong Kong's rule of law, social order and economy, and harmed people's livelihoods, but also challenged the constitutional principle of ""one country, two systems"".
As a practical policy, the main goal of ""one country, two systems"" is to achieve peaceful national reunification and maintain Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability. Since Hong Kong's return to China in 1997, ""one country, two systems"" has been the operating principle between the central government and the SAR government, and has become an important part of the modernization of the national governance system and capacity.
In fact, ""one country, two systems"" could be regarded as a systemic concession the central government has granted Hong Kong to boost national development.
In the 1980s, as a prosperous and stable city, Hong Kong helped propel the Chinese mainland's reform and opening-up. No wonder ""one country, two systems"" and the SAR's Basic Law advocate the preservation of the SAR's pre-1997 institutional system to help maintain the city's prosperity and stability, in order to realize the country's peaceful reunification. That's why Hong Kong's Basic Law has some special arrangements.
However, in recent years, China's rapid economic growth and rising national strength have dramatically changed the SAR's position in the country.
On the other hand, extreme political ideas have found frequent expression in Hong Kong, with some even raising ""Hong Kong independence"" slogans recently. Which means the ""one country, two systems"" principle faces a new challenge, and the central government should deal with Hong Kong-related issues more decisively.
""Sticking to 'one country, two systems' and promoting the country's reunification"" comprise one of the 14 national basic strategies. Under the guidance of this strategy, the central government is expected to more steadfastly implement the ""one country, two systems"" principle and strengthen governance over the Hong Kong and Macao SARs. As such, the central government is likely to more effectively promote the rule of law and set the political bottom line for ""Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong"" to ensure the one-country principle really becomes the basis of the ""two systems"".
It should be borne in mind that Hong Kong is enjoying a ""high degree of autonomy"" on the basis of the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
According to the Basic Law, political expression is one of the basic rights enjoyed by Hong Kong residents. But Hong Kong protesters should never cross the bottom line.
Any activity that endangers national sovereignty, challenges the authority of the central government and the SAR's Basic Law, or uses Hong Kong-related issues to sabotage China's interests is a violation of the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle, which will never be tolerated.

SAR denounces push in US Congress to pass HK 'democracy' legislation,"The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government denounced the United States Congress' reintroduction of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act and reiterated that foreign legislatures should not interfere in any way in the internal affairs of Hong Kong, according to a written release from the SAR on Monday.
It also condemned the illegal behavior of radical protesters over the weekend, saying their acts of vandalism must stop immediately.
""Since the return to the motherland, the Hong Kong SAR has been exercising 'Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong' and a high degree of autonomy in strict accordance with the Basic Law,"" the statement said.
The ""one country, two systems"" principle has been fully and successfully implemented.
Human rights and freedom in Hong Kong are fully protected by the Basic Law, the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and other legislation, the statement said. ""The Hong Kong SAR government attaches great importance to them and is determined to safeguard them,"" according to the statement.
During Sunday's protest, several subway stations, including Central and Wan Chai stations on Hong Kong Island, were severely vandalized. Some radicals started fires near several station entrances, smashed windows and shattered the screens of ticket machines.
Over the weekend, 157 people were arrested, police said.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and the management of subway operator MTR Corp said such vandalism is intolerable. Such acts have seriously affected the lives of local residents and tourists and have severely tarnished Hong Kong's image, they agreed.
Lam spoke in a meeting after visiting the area around Central Station. Lam and the MTR managers vowed to maintain their resolve against such violence and will work together to minimize the negative impact of protests.
The SAR Secretary for Transport and Housing Frank Chan Fan also appealed to the public to respect the responsibilities of MTR's staff as well as the public's right to travel.
The MTR is the most important part of Hong Kong's transportation system, handling an average of 5 million passenger trips a day.
All exits of Central Station were open on Monday, thanks to overnight repairs by MTR staff and a cleaning crew that started work early in morning.
A cleaner who wanted to remain anonymous said she arrived at 7 am to erase the graffiti sprayed on outer walls of subway stations, phone booths and advertising boards.
She said the facilities ""have nothing to do with the protests and should not be damaged"".
On Sunday, most shops and restaurants in the area closed right after Central Station announced suspension of services at 4 pm.
Nass, 28, a shop manager in Central, said Sunday was the first time his establishment had closed earlier than usual in recent months. ""But if it (the violence and vandalism) continues, or occurs even once a month, our company may have to lay off some staff,"" said Nass, adding that the retail heartland of Hong Kong continued to see fewer visitors since the protests began three months ago.
A 76-year-old resident who gave his name as Yadav said he had to walk to work at 8:30 pm on Sunday because buses and the subway were out of service.
""I don't know when this will stop. But what protesters did was very bad. People living here are having a very difficult time,"" Yadav said.

"Protesters must not disrupt airport, subway","Blocking transportation links to Hong Kong International Airport violates a court injunction barring protesters from impeding airport operations, and can result in contempt of court lawsuits, authorities said on Friday.
They made the announcement as the High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on Friday extended an interim injunction that bans protesters from impeding airport operations.
The judgment was made amid repeated calls on social media by anti-government groups to mobilize people to deliberately overwhelm airport railways, airport buses, private cars and other means of transportation to and from the airport to disrupt the normal operations of the airport this weekend.
The injunction, originally valid from Aug 14 through Friday, is meant to prevent protesters from assembling at the Hong Kong airport, one of the world's busiest transportation hubs. The injunction was issued after escalating violence during protests disrupted airport operations and led to the cancellation of numerous flights.
Judge Wilson Chan of the Court of First Instance of the High Court said on Friday in the judgment that while disturbances at the airport had seemingly subsided after the issuance of the interim injunction order on Aug 13, there is evidence of continued threats to the airport during this weekend, including repeated calls on social media to obstruct access control points to prevent passengers from entering the airport.
""Given the continuing threat of disturbances at the airport, I have no hesitation in continuing the order to maintain the status quo until trial or further court order,"" said the judgment.
""The balance of convenience is strongly in favor of continuing the order,"" the judgement said, stressing that ""the smooth running of the airport is of crucial significance to Hong Kong, in particular the security and safety of its residents and travelers, its commercial interests as well as its international reputation"".
In a statement published in several local newspapers on Friday, Airport Authority Hong Kong appealed to young people not to participate in or support acts that disrupt airport services or otherwise undermine the reputation of the airport.
Tens of thousands of workers earn their living from airport-related activities including aviation, tourism, logistics and trade, said the authority.
""Blocking roads and railway links to the airport is also regarded as unlawfully and willfully obstructing or interfering with the proper use of the airport,"" said Lau Wing-kei, deputy district commander of the Airport District. He warned at a police news briefing on Friday afternoon that anyone who violates the injunction could be sued for contempt of court.
Frank Chan Fan, secretary for transport and housing, also reminded the public not to violate the injunction.
On Thursday, seven civil aviation trade unions in Hong Kong issued a joint statement that strongly condemned the demonstrators' attempts to continue disturbances at the airport during the coming weekend and criticized the demonstrators for damaging the livelihoods of so many airport employees.
On Friday, Hong Kong's MTR Corp again condemned all acts of violence and illegal activities by protesters.
MTR Corp said Friday night it obtained the interim injunction from the High Court to restrain people from interfering or damaging operation at all stations and trains on its railway network, including the West Kowloon high-speed rail station.
The injunction will be effective until next June 30.
""We support proper enforcement of the law against these illegal activities and reserve the right to take suitable legal actions and seek suitable legal relief from the court including, if appropriate, injunctions to ensure that the safe and proper operation and use of our network can be assured,"" it said.
Foreign experts to join panel
Barrister Anthony Neoh, head of the Independent Police Complaints Council, Hong Kong's police watchdog, said on Friday that it will invite overseas scholars and specialists to study the recent protests in the city and the police's handling of them. The public has been calling for a thorough investigation into the clashes between protesters and the police, and how police have responded to these incidents.
The council will invite experts from oversight bodies in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Canada to form a panel of international experts. The candidates have extensive experience in researching crowd behavior, public order and police actions, according to the council.
The panel will join the assessment and make subsequent recommendations to ensure the objectivity of the probe. The list of panel members will be announced within 10 days, the council said.

Law and order bedrock for Hong Kong's prosperity,"Following on from the earlier violence that erupted during protests against the proposed amendments to the territory's extradition laws, there were more clashes between police and demonstrators on Monday, when Hong Kong celebrated the 22nd anniversary of its founding as a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China on July 1, 1997.
The unrest is among those, particularly Hong Kong's youth, who feel unable to benefit from the SAR's development and excluded from its decision-making process - sentiments that have led to populist movements elsewhere - and those who are using these grievances and disturbances as a means to serve their own agendas and put pressure on Beijing.
In her speech at a flag-raising ceremony on Monday morning, Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor acknowledged that her administration has to do more to grasp public sentiments accurately and pledged her government's work will be closer and more responsive to the aspirations, sentiments and opinions of the whole community.
But that does not mean there will be any weakening of the ""one country, two systems"" framework that was established to smooth the return of Hong Kong to the motherland. That the SAR is an inalienable part of the PRC is a constitutional reality enshrined in Article 1 of the Basic Law.
Yet ever since Britain returned Hong Kong's sovereignty back to China, there has been one attempt after another to undermine law and order in the SAR and obstruct its healthy development.
China's Foreign Ministry spokesman once again felt compelled to chide Britain on Monday for ""flagrantly interfering"" in Hong Kong matters and reminding it, and other countries, that the SAR's affairs are purely China's concern.
Under the framework of ""one country, two systems"", the central government remains steadfast in supporting the chief executive and the SAR government in governing Hong Kong in accordance with law.
Lam has said her government is setting no easy goals and avoiding no difficult tasks, which is bound to expose divergent opinions, as no society is homologous. But there can be no justification for the orchestrated outbreaks of violence, which are not condoned by any law abiding citizens.
Looking ahead, the only way for the SAR to sustain economic growth and maintain stability is to further integrate its own development into the nation's overall development, especially by playing its part in advancing the Belt and Road Initiative and Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Both development programs serve as practical platforms for Hong Kong to generate more growth momentum that can be translated into practical benefits for local residents."
HK violence condemned by overseas specialists,"Foreign government officials and experts slammed the violence perpetrated by radical protesters in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and voiced support for the legitimate actions taken by the HKSAR government and local police to restore order.
Mohammad Faisal, a spokesman for Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Hong Kong affairs are completely China's internal affairs, and Pakistan understands the actions taken by the Chinese central government and the HKSAR government to uphold national sovereignty and maintain the city's prosperity and stability.
Helen Sham-Ho, a former Australian politician, said the current chaotic situation in Hong Kong is damaging its prosperity, adding that there is no doubt that the priority is to regain order and police have the right to uphold law and order.
Michael Borchmann, a law expert and former government official from Germany, said that the purpose of the ongoing protests in Hong Kong is to stir up chaos and turmoil in the city, and is not a response to the draft extradition bill, Nouvelles d'Europe cited him as saying.
Borchmann said it is true that freedom of speech and freedom of assembly are protected by law in Hong Kong, but this doesn't give people the right to use violence to impose on the freedoms of others. Criticism of China by some voices in the Western media was irrelevant, he added.
In reference to the recent attacks on Hong Kong police and the blockade of Hong Kong International Airport by some radical demonstrators, Abdulaziz Alshaabani, a Saudi Arabian expert on Chinese affairs, said such radical acts seriously undermined the rule of law, hindered economic development and harmed the interests of Hong Kong's people.
If the violence further escalates, Hong Kong's prosperity and stability will suffer a severe blow, undermining its well-deserved international image and status, the Saudi expert said.
Wilson Lee Flores, a columnist at The Philippine Star, said the continued chaos in Hong Kong, apparently created by anti-government protesters and encouraged by foreign influences, must be quickly stopped.
Strong measures should be taken as the chaos is not only bad for Hong Kong's economy and tourism, but also disadvantageous for the prosperity of the East Asian region as Hong Kong is an important financial and trade center, he said.
China's Mission to the European Union said on Wednesday that what is happening in Hong Kong is now devolving into extreme violence.
It said in an online statement that any attempt to lump together the rigorously lawful exercise of duties by Hong Kong police with the extreme and violent offenses by radicals is absolutely misleading and incorrect, and China is firmly opposed to such attempts.
China's diplomatic mission in Geneva also lashed out at the United Nations human rights office on Wednesday, accusing its spokesman of making a ""wrongful statement"" about protests in Hong Kong that ""sends the wrong signal to the violent criminal offenders"".
The Office of the Commissioner of the Foreign Ministry in the HKSAR said on Wednesday that the words and deeds of some lawmakers from the United States have shown them to be the ""black hands"" behind the violent radicals in Hong Kong, referring to a comment from US legislators including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Violence is pushing HK into 'abyss of destruction',"Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor warned on Tuesday that escalating violence is pushing the special administrative region into an ""abyss of destruction"".
She appealed to the public to calm down, set aside differences on political issues and reject violence.
Meeting reporters ahead of the Executive Council, Lam appealed to the public, in a voice trembling with emotion, to pause and think.
""The top priority now is to oppose violence and safeguard the rule of law,"" she said. ""Rational discussions will start after the city's law and order is restored. And that's when we can mend what has been torn apart.""
Lam said developments over the past week validated her concerns that Hong Kong was in a dangerous situation. She reminded people that Hong Kong had been ripped apart by violent protests that started on June 9, which saw radicals clash with the police, and residential and business areas become virtual war zones.
Lam said the chief executive's responsibility is to ensure that Hong Kong remains a safe, orderly and law-abiding city.
Flights were canceled on Tuesday for a second consecutive day as protesters occupied large parts of the Hong Kong International Airport. All departing flights were canceled in the afternoon in the wake of what officials said was an unauthorized assembly seriously disrupting the airport's operations.
Also on Tuesday, Hong Kong's stock market dropped to its lowest level since Jan 4 at the end of trading.
Following the fall of all three major US indexes overnight, the benchmark Hang Seng Index fell by 1 percent as the market opened. The index continued on a downward trajectory, ending the day at 25,281.3, a decline of 543.42 points or 2.1 percent.
Shares of airline companies were among leading decliners in the wake of the cancellation of more than 300 inbound and outbound flights on Tuesday. Hong Kong's largest carrier, Cathay Pacific Airways, continued its drop on Monday. Shares of Cathay Pacific tumbled 2.96 percent to HK$9.51 ($1.21), a 10-year low.
At press time, police had not taken action against the illegal assembly at the airport.
Citing recent examples of the obstruction of law enforcement operations, the Hong Kong Police Force appealed to the public on Tuesday for cooperation in maintaining law and order.
At a daily news briefing, Chief Superintendent of Police Public Relations Tse Chun-chung said two months of violent protests against the now-shelved extradition amendment bill have created tensions between the public and police.
Daily police operations, even those unrelated to the protests, have been impeded to various degrees due to the hostility toward the police, Tse said.
He cited a recent incident in which police officers were blocked by over 50 residents as they investigated a suicide case in public housing in Tai Po on Sunday night. The officers were shut out of the building. Some residents targeted them with laser pointers while others surrounded a police van, according to the officer.

Former lawmaker says HK no business of UK,"George Galloway, an outspoken former member of the United Kingdom's Parliament, said how the central and Hong Kong government officials handle the situation in the former British colony is none of the UK's business.
""Hong Kong is no more Britain's business than is the business of Slovakia or Romania. We are just another foreign country. For the British state, they have never accepted in their heart that their empire has gone and Hong Kong is (part of) China,"" Galloway said in an interview with China Daily in Hong Kong.
""They had to make the diplomatic withdrawal that they did in 1997 because they ran out of the ransom in New Territories, and they have tried ever since to keep an as large (a) foothold on the people, the society and the economy in Hong Kong as they possibly could,"" he added.
Galloway drew international attention for his combative performance when facing a committee of senior United States politicians as part of the Senate's investigation into the Iraq oil-for-food scandal in 2005.
Galloway recalled what Deng Xiaoping, the late Chinese leader, said before Hong Kong's handover from the UK - the days when foreign countries can order China what to do are over. ""They were over when Deng said so; they were over in 1997 and they are certainly over in 2019,"" he said.
Last week, Liu Xiaoming, the Chinese ambassador to the UK, said in a news conference in London that no foreign country should interfere in Hong Kong affairs.
But Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the British House of Commons, expressed his view that Britain has a role to play in calming increasingly violent clashes between protesters and police, even suggesting the UK extend British nationality to Hong Kong residents.
Galloway said, ""This is like events happening in a part of our empire even though that empire has largely long gone and certainly has gone in China,"" and he accused the British government of practicing double standards.
""Indeed the very same Tom Tugendhat argued, I heard him, I saw his lips move, that the internal affairs of Saudi Arabia are a matter for Saudi Arabia, but the internal affairs of China are apparently not a matter for China,"" he added.
In the same news conference, Liu said Western media outlets are inescapably responsible for the current situation in Hong Kong, as their selective reporting and distortions have resulted in the prevalence of wrong information that misled the public.
Galloway echoed Liu's view, adding, ""This is part of a spectrum of attacks which are designed to slow China's advance and weaken China's internal cohesion with the view to stopping China becoming the most important economy and country in the world.""
On Aug 12, protesters occupied Hong Kong International Airport and brought the facility to a standstill. The Hong Kong police's handling of the situation was widely criticized in the West, but Galloway argued that it was not honestly dealt with by Western media.
""What in fact is an example of light-handed police is portrayed in the Western media as tyrannical dictatorial policing. And that's simply objectively not true.
""Because by any objective test, the Hong Kong police have handled these events with less aggression, less violence than any police force anywhere else in the world would do,"" he said. ""If this was England, still more if it was in France, if Charles de Gaulle Airport was seized by protesters and had to be closed¡• they would be cleared violently within the first hours of such a protest,"" he added.

"Reassure HK, remind Britain SAR no longer a British 'colony'","The ongoing distress of Britain over the loss of Hong Kong as a ""colony"" can be attributed to some British politicians not sufficiently examining their own history and trying to incite Hong Kong residents against Beijing. So much is borne out of the evidence.
The British never underwent what the Germans call vergangenheitsbewaltigung - coming to terms with the past. Some in Britain are still proud that Britain was a colonial power. Call it nostalgia for Empire. No wonder some British politicians feel ""responsible"" for Hong Kong even after it returned to China in 1997. They think China, not Britain, is the invisible hand here.
In 1997, China agreed to grant the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region autonomy for 50 years under the ""one country, two systems"" framework. But some Hong Kong residents attach too much importance to the ""two systems"" while ignoring that it is part of the ""one China"" framework.
The British education system is somewhat hostile toward Beijing. I should know; I studied Chinese in Britain, at Edinburgh University. We students in 2002 were constantly told to spend our exchange year in Hong Kong or Taiwan. And when I turned down a Hong Kong offer and went to Fudan University in Shanghai instead, irritation ensued.
Our dons decided that colleges on the Chinese mainland were substandard - inferior to the ones in Hong Kong - and therefore Chinese grades and credits would never count toward a British degree. That was in 2006.
Those who went to Hong Kong of course got cool jobs, sinecures and perks - sometimes as press soldiers for Western media outlets. If you work in the globalist Anglo-Saxon media, you need to target Beijing. That's a basic thing they ask you to do.
Most China-bashing media outlets have branched out in Hong Kong, from where they launch their attacks against Beijing. They use liberal studies to indoctrinate the youth. They also ""create"" heroes and martyrs for the West, like Joshua Wong, who was jailed for his role in the ""Occupy Central"" movement in Hong Kong.
And because of this outdated colonial education system and the China experts, the British in Hong Kong sometimes behave like overlords and viceroys. That's why the last British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, tried to assume the role of ""guardian angel"" of the SAR during the ""Occupy"" movement in 2014 and again during the recent protests against the proposed amendments to Hong Kong's extradition law. And that's why British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told violent protesters recently that Britain would stand with them.
The master narrative is everywhere. The agents are still there. White privilege is rampant. Woo the people, divide and conquer. Those Hong Kong separatists and troublemakers are rewarded by powerful Western interest groups with passports, visa-free travels and media limelight. The city is plagued by foreign intelligence services that collaborate closely with some British media outlets.
We could conclude that Britain suffers from post-colonial stress disorder. However, it is more than that. It is also rage: The loss of Hong Kong in the Far East was Britain's most stressful experience since the independence of India. The stress was accompanied by anger, anger about everything Chinese. How could a former loser in world history become the master of ""Britain's Hong Kong"" now? This is humiliation for some British politicians.
And because it is a dangerous mix of trauma and rage, some British politicians will try to regain Hong Kong in Britain's sphere of influence, or the West's sphere of influence. Britain lost its glory but not its old structures, banks and media mostly, which keep instigating anti-China sentiments.
Since the otherwise charming Anglo-Chinese relations should be preserved, Hong Kong society needs to calm down and Britain needs to be reminded that Hong Kong is no longer its ""colony"". What is the big deal about Hong Kong? And why are some British politicians obsessed with it? It's the colonial past.

Time to stop making China a bogeyman,"As a foreign correspondent, I have paid close attention to criticism of China by other countries. After all, honest and sincere criticism, whether of China's politics, economy or society, will help make China a better country.
While such criticisms are precious, they are often overwhelmed by the irresponsible and groundless accusations by politicians and so-called opinion leaders.
At the plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Monday, a number of EP members pointed the finger at the Chinese central government and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government and justified, even eulogized Hong Kong's violent mobs that stormed the Legislative Council building, blocked the airport departure terminal, vandalized the Mass Transit Railway stations and trains and threw petrol bombs at police.
If the Hong Kong rioters' actions are justified, why have they criticized the Yellow Vest protests that have continued since November? On Sept 14, just two days before the plenary session, Yellow Vest protests were held across French cities, from Paris, Marseille, Rouen and Dijon to Bordeaux, Toulouse and Strasbourg. In Nantes, police used tear gas and water cannons after some protesters threw projectiles. Twenty people were arrested.
One of the most ridiculous accusations against China this past week probably came from Gordon G. Chang, a frequent commentator on Fox News and CNN. In his response to Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke's remarks on gun control, Chang said on his Twitter:""Hey, @BetoORourke, do you know what happens when citizens don't have guns? You get#China.""
Chang is notorious for his 2001 book The Coming Collapse of China, a laughing stock for almost all China watchers. Contrary to his prediction, China has in the past 18 years become the world's second-largest economy, the largest trading nation and the largest retail market, and has built the longest high-speed rail and subway systems.
His criticism of China relating to gun ownership is easy to dismiss because China's neighbors, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Singapore all have much lower gun ownership than China.
I don't know why Chang is so proud of the United States having the highest gun ownership in the world. A Gallup poll released on Sept 10 showed that almost half (48 percent) of US adults say they are ""very"" or ""somewhat"" worried about being a victim of mass shooting.
Like most China watchers, I normally don't take Chang seriously. But the fact that he is a frequent commentator on influential US cable news networks, more frequent than those honest scholars from Washington think tanks such as Brookings Institution and Peterson Institute, is deeply disturbing. It literally means that he has been offered a platform to mislead US public by spreading misinformation, even making hate speeches against China.
Therefore, the rising unfavorable opinion of China among the US public in a Pew Center survey in August can be largely attributed to the opinions of US politicians, from the president to lawmakers like Senator Marco Rubio to TV commentators such as Chang, who have been filling the airwave with anti-China rhetoric.
For many years, China has been the favorite bogeyman for US politicians. And as the race for the 2020 US presidential election heats up, China bashing will again become a favorite pastime for both Republican and Democratic candidates.
Talking tough against China, regardless of facts, would sadly make them look both ""politically correct"" and ""apt presidential"" candidates in today's US.
We should all call out those lies. Factchecking outlets, which have grown rapidly in recent years, have a big responsibility to call out those politicians and TV commentators so they dare not to repeat the lies in front of the public time and time again.

Using law to safeguard rule of law,"That the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government has canceled the annual National Day fireworks show on Oct 1 and Hong Kong Jockey Club called off Wednesday's Happy Valley race, both for security reasons, speaks volumes of the damage the violent demonstrations have caused to the city.
Under the garb of democracy, signified by the masks they've worn to hide their identity, the insurrectionists have attacked police officers and stations, and tried to break into the Legislative Council building. It is absurd indeed that, despite claiming to fight for ""democracy"" and ""righteousness"", they are afraid of revealing their true identity.
On Saturday, a middle-aged Hong Kong resident pulled the mask off a radical's face when the latter was showering a group of people singing China's national anthem with invectives. Instead of facing up to the situation, the radical punched the middle-aged man, cutting open his left brow ridge, covered his face with his arm and fled the scene.
Immediately after being uploaded online, the video, recorded by a bystander, drew wide attention. And the violent protester was, ironically, identified as a 25-year-old civil servant working for Hong Kong customs, giving rise to a heated debate on whether the SAR should have a special law banning protesters from covering their faces with masks.
Masks seem to have put the demonstrators above the law, simply because they cannot be identified. Which has seriously compromised the rule of law in Hong Kong.
So it is good to hear Hong Kong Secretary of Justice Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah saying the city's legislators are studying the feasibility of making such a law - which has been on their agenda for three years since the Mong Kok riots took place.
In many countries and regions, such a law plays an important role in demarcating the legal and moral boundaries of demonstrators.
There are enough reasons to believe such a law would be backed by public opinion, because it is already a consensus among the sane elements in the city that the rule of law must be safeguarded by putting an end to the violence in the city.
Since too many radical protesters have been released on bail within hours of being detained under the current Hong Kong law, it is necessary and urgent to address the issue using legal means to remove their masks.
Tough times call for tough measures."
"Hong Kong is not its backyard, and the US should know that","That some demonstrators in Hong Kong are hell-bent on violating laws and disrupting normal life was on display again on Monday when thousands of them formed ""human chains"" outside schools to push for their so-called democratic demands following a weekend of violent clashes and a march urging the US president to ""liberate"" Hong Kong.
The fact that violence and demonstrations have continued despite the Special Administrative Region government withdrawing the bill aimed at amending the extradition law shows the protesters have been hypnotized into believing the unbelievable - that they can ""liberate"" the city.
What they may not have realized is that the central government under no circumstances will allow China's sovereignty over Hong Kong to be compromised.
Overt and covert foreign interference in Hong Kong's affairs has been an open secret since the protests began three months ago, with some US politicians openly throwing their weight behind the demonstrators.
Some radical demonstrators have broken every law they could break by attacking police officers and innocent passers-by, vandalizing police stations, government offices and metro stations, and paralyzing the city's international airport and harming people's livelihoods. Yet US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Marco Rubio unabashedly call the demonstrators' terrorist-like acts a struggle for ""democracy, freedom and human rights"".
The United States has a long history of poking its dirty nose in other countries' internal affairs to advance its not-so-hidden agenda. It tried to do the same in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, and having failed in its design there moved to the Hong Kong, where the initial protests offered it an opportunity to fulfill its political and economic goal of containing China's rise on the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights.
To further the US agenda, Pelosi said last week that US Congress members ""look forward to swiftly advancing the bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act to reaffirm the US commitment to democracy, human rights and the rule of law in the face of Beijing's crackdown"".
As such, the US will deliberately lend a deaf ear to the Hong Kong government, which said on Monday that ""foreign legislatures should not interfere in any form in the internal affairs"" of the SAR and that it was ""very much in Hong Kong's own interest to maintain our autonomy to safeguard our interests and advantages under the 'one country, two systems' principle"".
Hong Kong residents should be fully aware of the US plot and firmly oppose the US interference, for they will have to bear the dire consequences of their city being torn apart bit by bit by the violent demonstrators, not the dream-selling US politicians."
White House playing wrong card in its risky game with China,"Following its $2.2 billion arms deal with Taiwan that was announced on July 9, the United States Department of State has reportedly ""informally"" notified corresponding House and Senate committees that it supports the sale of F-16 fighter jets to the island.
Not surprisingly, the Chinese government has lodged ""solemn representations"" against the $8 billion deal, as it has each time arms sales to the island have been proposed or carried out.
That is because they seriously violate the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqu¨¦s, especially the Aug 17, 1982, communiqu¨¦, and interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine China's sovereignty and security interests, as the Chinese Foreign Ministry pointed out on Monday.
Of course, should the deal get the green light and be inked by both Washington and Taipei, the actual delivery will not take place for several years.
Even if they were to be delivered immediately, 66 F-16s will do very little to change the military imbalance between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
Given the mainland's asymmetrical and constantly enlarging military advantage against Taiwan, rather than constituting a severe security challenge to the mainland, the surplus F-16s to be sold to Taiwan represent a matter of principle in Beijing's eyes. It holds sovereignty over Taiwan to be a ""core interest"" as well as a diplomatic redline in its relations with foreign countries.
Not to mention there is the legitimate concern that the Washington may be employing the arms sales to Taiwan, along with the ongoing protests in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, as bargaining chips in its trade talks with Beijing.
However, playing the Taiwan card will more likely than not ruin the prospect of a deal rather than facilitate it. As Beijing has repeatedly stated, a deal will not be made at the expense of such a key national interest.
The only thing the proposed arms sale can do is to send what Washington has time and again been warned are the ""wrong messages"" to Taipei, encouraging it to edge further toward a military showdown with the mainland, the outcome of which is easily predictable. Such a scenario would be detrimental to Taiwan, the mainland and the US.
Given it announced it would impose sanctions on the companies involved in the July deal, Beijing's response to the latest arms sales has actually been disproportionally restrained so far considering the severity of the matter.
But Washington should stop its grave interference in China's internal affairs, cease selling arms to the island and end all military contacts with it, otherwise China will have to take measures to safeguard its interests depending on how the situation develops."
Mainland movie industry skips Taiwan film festival as cross-Straits ties worsen,"China's film regulator has suspended participation of mainland movies and personnel in the 56th Golden Horse Film Festival in Taipei in November amid rising tensions across the Taiwan Straits.
China Film News, a magazine published by the China Film Administration, reported the news on Wednesday without giving any reason for the suspension.
Chen Xing, a Taiwan studies professor at Beijing Union University, said the move was due not only to ""Taiwan independence"" remarks during last year's award ceremony at the festival, but also to the recent worsening of cross-Straits relations.
The organizing committee of the festival in Taipei responded by letter on Wednesday that it was disappointed by the news but the event would go on as scheduled.
A total of 148 feature films have been registered with the festival this year, compared with last year's 228, according to the organizing committee.
The Golden Horse Awards are one of three major film honors in the Chinese-speaking region - the two others are the Golden Rooster Awards on the mainland and the Hong Kong Film Awards. Mainland participants have been big winners since they began attending the event in 1996. Last year, they won about 60 percent of the awards.
However, last year's Golden Horse Awards ceremony was overshadowed by ""Taiwan independence"" remarks, triggering discontent from mainland participants and anger from the mainland public.
Documentary director Fu Yue, the best documentary award winner last year, said in her acceptance speech that her biggest dream is that ""our country"" - referring to Taiwan - can be regarded as an ""independent entity"".
Mainland actress and jury chair Gong Li later refused to join Taiwan-born director Ang Lee, head of last year's executive committee, onstage to present the award for best feature film, a move many interpreted as a protest.
Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, said in November after the event that film industry professionals on both sides of the Straits should oppose such pro-independence acts and remarks.
He said the festival is a platform for film professionals across the Straits to communicate with each other, but some political forces made use of the occasion to create political trouble.
The suspension follows a recent travel policy change. The Ministry of Culture and Tourism announced last week that the issuance of permits for mainland individuals to travel to Taiwan will be suspended starting in August due to the current cross-Straits relations.
Ma said last week the Democratic Progressive Party's ""Taiwan independence"" secessionist activities led to the suspension of individual travel permits to Taiwan.
""They have been constantly fomenting hostility toward the mainland and creating confrontation across the Straits, which destroyed the foundation and conditions for such travel,"" he said.

Public clears protest debris left during chaotic weekend,"Hong Kong residents took to the streets during the weekend to clear roadblocks and debris left by rioters on major roads, after the most chaotic week since the series of violent protests erupted in June.
However, violent clashes continued in the vicinity of local universities.
On Sunday morning, a group of Hong Kong people arrived near Hong Kong Polytechnic University to clear barriers, piles of bricks and debris from the Chatham Road South. The road is near the Cross Harbour Tunnel, the city's busiest tunnel, linking Kowloon and the Hong Kong Island.
It was the second day that residents volunteered to clear debris left over from the rioting.
However, the volunteers were harassed and attacked by black-clad protesters gathered in the PolyU campus. Imitating police warnings, protesters demanded the residents leave or they would ""use force to disperse them"". They threw bricks from platforms and drove the volunteers away with rods.
Later, rioters attacked police officers with gasoline bombs, bows and arrows and metal balls.
During the melee, a police officer engaged in media liaison duties was shot in the calf with an arrow, police said.
Police severely condemned the violent acts and warned that anyone who stayed behind or assisted protesters could face rioting charges.
An anti-riot police officer was hit by metal balls on the visor of his helmet, but was not injured, police added.
Police advised the public to avoid the area because a large number of weapons, including flammable fluids, were stored on the campus.
On Saturday night, a spokesman for PolyU said several laboratories had been vandalized and some ""dangerous"" chemicals were stolen. The university reported the incident to the police, considering it a serious threat to public safety.
Hundreds of thousands of commuters who need to travel across Victoria Harbour have been seriously inconvenienced as traffic in the vicinity of the PolyU, including the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, has been paralyzed since Nov 11.
Radical protesters blocked roads and damaged traffic facilities. Tunnel tollbooths were repeatedly set on fire. On Friday night, the Cross Harbour Tunnel Administration Building was broken into. Its power supply was cut off and the fire alarm system damaged.
It was not the only Hong Kong district paralyzed by radicals this week. Residents of northern and eastern parts of the New Territories were stranded for six days due to the blockade of Tolo Highway and vandalism on the East Rail line.
Positive reactions 
The considerable disruptions sparked positive public reactions. A large group of people voluntarily cleared debris and wreckage left by rioters. Traffic on most thoroughfares, including Tolo Highway, gradually resumed on Saturday.
""Their heart-touching actions show their love for Hong Kong and inject positive energy into society,"" a Hong Kong government spokesman said in a news release late Saturday evening.
Hundreds of residents also cleared Pok Fu Lam Road near the University of Hong Kong, another base for rioters. However, a group of masked people clad in black disrupted the cleanup and firebombed the activity from an adjacent overpass. No one was hurt.
The government appealed to the public to be careful and strongly condemned rioters' dangerous acts.
The cleanups also saw participation of foreigners. Brian, a United States citizen working in the finance sector, brought his girlfriend with him.
He described protesters' acts as ""insane"" and said, ""They are turning people against themselves"".
Soldiers from the People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison, dressed in civilian clothing, joined a group of residents on Saturday afternoon clearing barricades set up by radicals outside the Kowloon East Barracks - near the Hong Kong Baptist University.
They were applauded.

Hong Kong unrest turns off visitors,"City's police denounce vandalism, will not tolerate violent behavior
The wanton destruction of property in Hong Kong by violent radicals on Sunday has ""scared"" and ""saddened"" people in the city.
In the 20th straight week of violent protests, rioters targeted Chinese mainland-linked shops, banks and bookstores in Kowloon, a densely populated area home to multiple businesses and transportation facilities.
Radicals pried open metal shutters of some shops, vandalized the premises and set fires. They also hurled gasoline bombs at the Tsim Sha Tsui police station and launched arson attacks in Mong Kok and Yau Ma Tei.
Residents and tourists shared their feelings with China Daily on Monday after the weekend unrest.
Walking down Nathan Road, one of the main thoroughfares in central Kowloon, China Daily reporters saw many cleaners sweeping up broken glass and scrubbing graffiti from walls and windows on Monday morning. There were few tourists to be seen.
Almost all traffic lights along the six-lane road were out of service, and traffic was chaotic, with pedestrians and vehicles vying to move ahead.
With extensive damage to three major subway stations - Mong Kok, Yau Ma Tei and Tsim Sha Tsui - many passengers, both morning commuters and tourists, had to try their luck at finding station entrances that were still open on Monday. Passengers had to line up to exit Tsim Sha Tsui station, as only four of 11 entrances remained functional.
Australian tourist Sophie Norr said she had to walk from Tsim Sha Tsui to Jordan after failing to find any passable entrances at Tsim Sha Tsui.
Norr, 20, said she was ""scared"" to see rampaging protesters, and that she had scrapped her plans to tour the city on Sunday. She described the acts of trashing subway entrances and facilities as ""insane"" and felt sorry for those tasked with carrying out repairs.
Unable to open for business on Monday was a flagship store of Xiaomi, a Chinese mainland tech company, that was almost burned down over the weekend by protesters. Branches of many banks were still undergoing repairs and were only able to offer limited services Monday morning.
Alex Mo, a 30-year-old who works in finance, took the initiative to take down posters put up by demonstrators on his way to work. Mo said he was ""furious and saddened"" to see the extensive damage done by violent radicals. He doubted that vandalizing shops had anything to do with the quest for democracy and freedom. ""They are thugs,"" Mo said.
His opinion was echoed by a clerk in her fifties who disapproved of damaging shops due to anti-China sentiment.
""If you don't like made-in-China products, you can throw what you have at home away as almost everything is made in China now. But you have no right to break into other people's shops,"" she said. ""After all, we all live in the same place. Hong Kong is our home, beautiful and neat. Seeing what it has become, nobody is happy,"" she said.
The Hong Kong Police denounced the vandalism. In a statement early Monday, the police said no violent behavior would be tolerated.

Military official slams attacks on govt body in HK as 'intolerable',"The violent attacks over the weekend in Hong Kong against the central government institution have challenged the principle of ""one country, two systems"" and are intolerable, the Ministry of National Defense said on Wednesday.
Speaking in Beijing, ministry spokesman Wu Qian said authorities have been following the situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region closely and are paying particular attention to the siege of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong SAR - the central government's top representative institution in the city - that rapidly turned violent on Sunday.
The protests have challenged the central government's authority, the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle, and the actions are ""absolutely intolerable"", Wu said.
Hong Kong, as the Pearl of the Orient, cannot be tainted, Wu said at the news conference.
When asked whether the People's Liberation Army will be deployed to the SAR to pacify the city's chaos, Wu referenced the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Garrisoning of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
According to Article 14, pursuant to the provisions of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR, the SAR government may, when necessary, ask the central government for assistance from the PLA Hong Kong Garrison in the maintenance of public order or in disaster relief.
The PLA Hong Kong Garrison has powers as stated in the laws of the HKSAR when rendering assistance.
The law of the PRC on the Garrisoning of the HKSAR stipulates that troops immediately return to their station upon completion of tasks.
Since mid-June, Hong Kong has seen a series of protests against the now-suspended extradition bill. They often turn violent later in the night, and the extent of violence has been escalating recently.
The latest event involved vandalism of the Liaison Office on Sunday in which the national emblem was defaced.

Anti-China bias reinforced by US social media giants,"When Nathan Rich first came to China in early 2012 as director of technology for a US visual effects company, he found everything was different. The food was foreign to him, the language was unfamiliar, and even the scenery was strange.
Now he challenges the questionable Western bias against China on social media platforms. He has about 450,000 subscribers on YouTube and his videos normally get about 100,000 views within 24 hours of being published.
This might not seem to be a great achievement among You-Tubers considering over 8,000 YouTube channels have more than 1 million subscribers as of 2019. However, it is remarkable for a channel that is distinctive for its China-friendly content.
Rich says that saying something positive about China on YouTube is far from easy. Especially since, after monitoring his viewing stats, Rich began to suspect that the tech company was intentionally demonetizing his videos, removing his subscribers and reducing the likes per video.
The ""impartial"" algorithms of YouTube
Rich explained how YouTube could be censoring his channel. A clip showed that his real subscriber count was ""mysteriously"" kept under 1,000, no matter how many people clicked the ""subscribe"" button. His videos got demonetized before release, on being published or during peak viewing.
By demonetizing a video, the platform strips the video of the opportunity to make money. It also works as a ""de-ranking"" mechanism, making channels less visible to viewers.
Seeking an explanation, Rich went into a flurry of back-and-forth emails with You-Tube. While he offered a large amount of evidence to verify that his followers are real people, rather than bots, Rich says YouTube made it clear that ""they know that they're real people, but they're just going to remove their count anyway"".
Nathan Rich is not the first video creator to accuse YouTube of arbitrary demonetization. With a growing number of complaints about its practice, YouTube updated its policies. A YouTube spokesperson told Wired Magazine that the company updated its algorithms and human moderators are sent to help streamline the efficiency of the automated flagging system for material that is deemed censorable if ""inappropriate or offensive to some audiences"". But the vagueness of that position means problems in censorship come with the territory.
That being said, the company removed more than 17,000 channels between April and June for violating its rules. But as Rebecca Lewis, an online extremism researcher at Data & Society, told Wired magazine, ""It's giving us the numbers without focusing on the story behind those numbers.""
Censorship across social media platforms
YouTube is not the only social media giant that arbitrarily censors users. Twitter and Facebook also do it. Twitter announced in August it had identified and removed accounts originating in China that ""were deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in the special administrative region, including undermining the legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement"". The claim was a unilateral allegation against Twitter users expressing their opinions on the escalating violence in Hong Kong. What's worse, the company's announcement only fueled the radicalism that makes use of the platform to sow discord among Hong Kong residents, especially young people.
Chinese media accounts were among those Twitter claimed were spreading disinformation. But if Twitter was taking the stance that state-backed media are untrustworthy, its ban should extend to media backed by the US government such as Voice of America and Radio Free Asia. Supervised by the US Agency for Global Media, these outlets receive 100 percent of their funding from the US government.
While Twitter, Facebook and YouTube profess their commitment to enabling the sharing of diverse ideas, they are censoring people and de facto policing the internet for the US government.
While pro-China voices are silenced on these platforms, anti-China content is dismissed as harmless if not intentionally given additional weight. In an analysis of 1.1 million Twitter posts, Oxford researchers Gillian Bolsover and Philip Howard found there was no evidence of pro-Chinese state automation on the platform. Instead, automated messages on Twitter were associated with anti-Chinese state perspectives and published in simplified Mandarin, presumably aimed at diasporic Chinese communities and mainland users.
Nathan Rich published a series of Hong Kong videos on YouTube and he claims that all of them were restricted to some extent. But what upset him most was that YouTube had boosted pro-separatist videos in their rankings. When it comes to YouTubers of comparable stature, those with anti-China views are favored by the supposedly ""neutral"" search algorithm by the platform, he says.
YouTube keeps its algorithms hidden from public view, but reports about how the company tweaks its algorithms to change the search results keep emerging. US conservative media Breitbart News accused YouTube of manipulating search results for gun control activist David Hogg and videos on abortion. While The Guardian did a broad study of over 8,000 You-Tube videos and concluded the YouTube recommendation process led to ""an unmistakable pattern of coordinated social media amplification"" of divisive clips and conspiracy videos.
Can people move away from YouTube?
What if China-friendly content creators moved away from YouTube, Twitter and Facebook? Is that possible?
Despite the privacy problems and questionable data practices, the social media titans such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter enjoy extensive popularity among Western audiences and remain the fastest and easiest way to reach people compared with traditional media outlets. According to a global ranking system, YouTube is the second most-visited site in the world, behind Google, which owns the platform. The video-viewing platform has over 2 billion monthly active users. Although 73 percent of US adults use YouTube, 80 percent of its users are from outside the US. But the dominant position of the US social media titans is accompanied by the lack of competition in the industry. YouTube has no peers in digital video advertising. Advertising revenues from digital videos totaled $16.3 billion in the US market last year. And YouTube accounted for the majority of that, according to Bloomberg.
In the business ecology of YouTube, its popularity lures more creators, media companies and tech firms onto the service, thus creating more ad space. This in turn enables YouTube to control ad prices and collect data about viewers, squeezing out any competitors.
Western media outlets are well known for offering a one-sided story about China. Chinese media are deemed as untruthful, and people who voice support for Chinese government are outright propagandists. The ""China is evil"" narrative enjoys popularity as it reaffirms the Western stereotypes of China. And with their monopolistic presence, YouTube and Google seem happy to endorse it by trying to make sure that the only information people can find is from anti-Chinese sources.
For pro-China content creators, going to another platform with comparable coverage and potential is thus far a pipedream. But if there is really no alternative, the question should be why YouTube with a virtual monopoly on video sharing, among many others, is not more thoroughly regulated.

There can be no lawless land in HK - that includes university campuses,"The subversives in Hong Kong have stepped up their crusade to paralyze the city with a ""blossom everywhere"" campaign of violence and vandalism across the city.
That flowery phrase hides the malice driving their actions.
Acts such as firebombing the inside of subway trains with passengers on board; throwing objects onto rail tracks to stop running trains; dropping sharp or heavy objects on moving vehicles from overhead walkways; setting fires inside road tunnels; throwing Molotov cocktails at buses loaded with passengers, including school pupils and elderly people; beating up drivers and passengers who try to remove roadblocks; and even dousing a man with a flammable liquid and setting him ablaze demonstrate the rioters have lost both their humanity and reason.
The violent hysteria of the troublemakers has brought the city to ""the brink of total collapse"", the police have warned, with their ""insanity"" forcing schools and shopping malls to close, as well as forcing the shutdown of large parts of the transport network.
Hong Kong's Education Bureau suspended classes at primary and secondary schools on Thursday because of the risks posed to children's safety, describing the situation in the city as ""chilling"". It called for schoolchildren to stay at home, ""and not to participate in illegal activities"".
Many of the masked people taking part in the protests are thought to be high school and university students. And these self-styled urban guerrillas have sought to turn Hong Kong's three university campuses into ""revolutionary bases"" from where they can launch their attacks on nearby traffic and transport arteries.
A social media post widely circulated among protester groups called for reinforcements to rally to the university campuses, saying the campuses are the ""most important battlegrounds, which must not be lost"".
It is not that these self-anointed rebels have any love for these seats of learning. They merely consider the campuses safe havens from police enforcement actions because of an established practice that requires police officers to notify the school management before they enter a campus to execute their duty.
This is a courtesy that should no longer be practiced given that under the Public Order Ordinance, police can enter any premises, with reasonable force if necessary, to stop or disperse a public gathering, other than a religious one, if they reasonably believe it could cause or lead to a breach of the peace.
""Nowhere in Hong Kong is lawless land,"" a police spokesman said, explaining the police had raided Chinese University of Hong Kong, because it was being used as a factory to make gasoline bombs.
The black-clad rioters need to be reminded: Campuses can never be safe havens for criminals."
Cathay Pacific warned by regulator,"The Civil Aviation Administration of China on Friday issued a warning to Cathay Pacific Airways in Hong Kong for a number of recently exposed safety and security risks.
The administration said some flight personnel of Cathay Pacific had participated in violent acts and were charged for related crimes, but they were not being banned from aviation activities. Some passengers' information has also been maliciously leaked.
Such practices have shown that there have been hidden dangers to aviation safety and security, and there are increased aviation risks from Hong Kong to the mainland, the regulator said in a statement.
The administration required Cathay Pacific to stop all its staff who have participated and supported illegal protests and violent activities in Hong Kong - as well as those with records of extreme behavior - from flying mainland-related flights or performing other duties related to mainland aviation activities beginning Saturday.
From Sunday, Cathay Pacific should report the identities of all crew members who are aboard flights to the Chinese mainland, or over the mainland, to mainland civil aviation authorities, the regulator said.
The airliner is also required to submit a plan to intensify its internal management and improve aviation safety and security to mainland authorities by next Thursday.
How Cathay Pacific implements the requirements will affect the handling of such issues in the future, the administration added.

Good governance key to build fairer society,"Editor's note: The decisions taken by the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th Communist Party of China Central Committee, which concluded recently, will have a far-reaching impact on society. Two experts share their views on the issue with China Daily's Yao Yuxin: Excerpts follow:
Diversity in the concept of modernization welcome
For me, modernization of governance in China means building a more efficient bureaucratic system and government services meeting people's needs. But in a society as complex as China, it's a big challenge to satisfy all the people, as they have increasingly higher expectations. The problem is not new, but it is more difficult to solve it under the present conditions.
China has established a mechanism to receive people's feedback on public services in order to improve them. And although technology and social media have played a big part in smoothing the communication channel, two problems remains to be addressed.
Given the huge flow of information, the government needs to properly understand and interpret the feedback. And second, the government has to further adjust its role, as there is a big space for NGOs and civil society to take part in social affairs. After all, they are allies of the government and can help it improve its efficiency.
Modernization does not mean Westernization. In fact, there's no fixed model for modernization. As people's lifestyles become increasingly similar, they are creating identity challenges in many countries - for instance, how can a society maintain its cultural identity while embracing globalization.
In this context, modernization with Chinese characteristics will help build a society which offers people alternatives and different paths to development.
The United States is very proud of American values and wants everyone to believe in those values. In contrast, China is developing the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics which would be fair and inclusive.
And since the US' demands and China's designs are not truly complementary, it's not easy to end the conflicts between them. Still, if we respect diversity, we should welcome the emergence of a power that is different from its Western counterparts and more suitable and appealing to a pluralistic world.
China has been playing an increasingly important role in regional and global affairs because it welcomes diversity in international relations. As such, the US and China should embrace their own values while respecting mutual interest and diversity. But they will take some time to work out how to do so.
Kerry Brown, director of the Lau China Institute at King's College in London
'One country' the basis of 'two systems'
Focusing on how to improve the national governance system and governance capacity, the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th Communist Party of China Central Committee highlighted five tasks for optimizing the ""one country, two systems"" in the Hong Kong (and Macao) Special Administrative Region.
The violent protests in Hong Kong over the past more than five months have exposed some loopholes in the SAR's legislation and the lack of strict law enforcement that have emboldened the protesters to continue unleashing violence and threatening national security. The violent protesters have held the city to ransom, vandalizing public property, and attacking police officers and ordinary residents alike because of weak law enforcement.
As the fourth plenum said, for national security, Hong Kong and Macao should be governed in accordance with China's Constitution and the Basic Law of the SARs, while the central government should back the SARs to strengthen their law enforcement. Actually, both the central and SAR governments have the responsibility to govern Hong Kong. And that is the meaning of the ""one country, two systems"".
The central government has introduced a number of policies to boost the integrated development of the Chinese mainland and the SARs, including the proposed Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. But some Hong Kong residents' lack of understanding about the motherland's progress has caused unnecessary controversaries.
No wonder the plenary session said that measures should be taken to properly educate the SAR residents about the importance of the rule of law, and China's sovereignty, Chinese history and civilization, so they can see the full picture and better understand the importance of the motherland.
The violent protests will prompt Hong Kong society to reach a wider consensus on the importance of the central government in maintaining peace in Hong Kong. Also, some Hong Kong media outlets should stop misguiding the protesters, and realize that the central government supports Hong Kong's economic and social development. More important, they should realize that ""one country"" is the very foundation of the ""two systems"".
Wang Zhenmin, director of the Center for Hong Kong and Macao Studies, Tsinghua University
The views do not necessarily represent those of China Daily."
"Continuing, rising violence in HK will only invite stronger response","All flights in and out of Hong Kong, except those departure flights that had completed the check-in process and arrival flights that were already heading to Hong Kong, were canceled on Monday after demonstrators descended on the city's airport to denounce what they claim is police violence.
Demonstrators in the special administrative region have been decrying what they say are heavy-handed police tactics. Yet the police actions are in response to serious public order challenges and violent crimes.
Demonstrators have not only wantonly destroyed public property and disrupted traffic in some major thoroughfares with their antics, disrupting daily life for everyone in the SAR, but the more radical among them have also escalated the violence. On the weekend, ""flash mobs"" attacked police officers in various districts of the city with bricks, iron bars and sharp objects.
More worryingly, as the authorities noted, petrol bombs were used for the first time. Such extreme violence may indicate more sinister forces are at work that may represent a threat to national security.
Yang Guang, spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said on Monday afternoon that the use of such weapons by radical protesters in attacking police officers in the past few days shows signs the demonstrations may be evolving in the direction of terrorism.
Should that be the case, the central authorities will have to act. Hong Kong law states that the PLA troops stationed in the SAR cannot interfere in local affairs, but it does allow for their deployment at the request of the SAR government to ""maintain public order"". The Basic Law also stipulates that should the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress decide the turmoil endangers national security and is beyond the control of the SAR government, it can issue an order applying the relevant national laws in the SAR.
No matter whether terrorism or other threats, the central government takes a proactive approach to maintaining social stability and law and order. It has offered its full support to the SAR authorities, urging them to take decisive measures to quell any destabilizing forces. The central authorities will not sit back with folded arms should the SAR need assistance.
On its part, the Hong Kong Police Force has sought to learn from the experiences of developed countries that have been rocked by rioting, learning from their tactics. On Monday, it displayed water canon that could be employed if the violence continues.
The authorities have exercised restraint so far, it is to be hoped these more aggressive tactics are not needed."
HK chief vows reform of governance,"Top executive of SAR says changes will help ensure variety of voices are heard
Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, vowed on Tuesday that her government would reform its governance style to ensure different voices are heard and addressed.
The pledge was made after Lam confirmed that an unpopular extradition amendment proposal that has been the subject of controversy is ""dead"", without any plan to restart it, and attributed the government's ""complete failure"" to amend the city's extradition law to her administration's deficiency in gauging public sentiment.
Speaking before a weekly meeting with her policy advisers at the Executive Council, the Hong Kong leader said her administration will continue to serve the city, and she expressed hope that the community will give her and her team a chance to mend the rift and take the city forward through ""a new governance style"".
To better address different views from people of various backgrounds in the community, Lam said the government will reform the existing consultative machinery and build a more open platform to facilitate dialogue with people from diverse backgrounds.
Lam herself will take the first step in this endeavor, saying she is ready to conduct open dialogues with university students. But she said she hoped the communication would take place without any prerequisites.
Other measures include a major change in the constitution and operation of the Youth Development Commission, an advisory body to the government on youth work, headed by Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung with some 40 members from various sectors in the city, Lam said.
Lam also said she has asked principal government officials to review any potentially controversial policies to see whether more public consultation is needed.
From her administration team to the Executive Council, Lam pledged that a more down-to-earth approach will be taken to better grasp public opinion and concerns.
Lam's remarks came after a series of large protests against the government's proposed extradition bill, with some having turned into violent clashes with the police and, in one case, the vandalizing of the SAR's legislature chambers.
""Saddened and shocked"" by the unrest, Lam called on people with different views to express themselves in a peaceful and orderly manner.
She stressed that granting amnesty to people arrested during the protests, as some have requested, would be against the rule of law in Hong Kong and would deviate from the Basic Law, which stipulates that prosecutorial decisions of the Department of Justice must be free from any interference.
Dozens of protestors have been arrested since mid-June on charges including unlawful assembly, assaulting a police officer and in crimes related to rioting.
Ip Kwok-him, member of the Executive Council, affirmed Lam's pledge to listen to more diverse voices, saying it will ensure better governance and help eliminate misunderstanding and defuse conflict in the community.
Kenneth Leung Yuk-wai, member of the Youth Development Commission, welcomed Lam's decision to reform the commission and conduct open dialogues with students, calling it an ""olive branch"".
He said he thought it will help the government to better address young people's concerns.

Top US senator's 'slander sends wrong signal to violent radicals',"Official: Washington ignoring facts, defaming central, SAR governments
A spokesperson for the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region denounced on Tuesday remarks made by US Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ""as groundless slander that sends a terribly wrong signal to violent radicals"".
It was reported that McConnell said on Monday that any violent crackdown on protests in Hong Kong would be ""completely unacceptable"". He wrote in a tweet that ""the people of Hong Kong are bravely standing up to the Chinese Communist Party as Beijing tries to encroach on their autonomy and freedom"".
The spokesperson said in a statement that some United States senators are ignoring facts, calling white black and defaming the central and the SAR governments.
China is strongly dissatisfied with, and firmly opposed to, such comments, the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson said a handful of radical protesters are continuously intensifying their extreme behavior, attacking police in very dangerous and cruel ways and brutally trampling on the rule of law and undermining social order in Hong Kong.
Their activities have seriously threatened local residents' lives, challenged Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and challenged the ""one country, two systems"" principle, according to the statement.
The spokesperson added that while the US severely punishes those who attack police within its borders, it chose to deliberately ignore the same thing happening in Hong Kong and slandered the Hong Kong police's civilized law enforcement as ""repression"" of peaceful protests.
This will only help the world to see more clearly how arrogant, biased, hypocritical, ruthless, selfish and bossy the US is, the spokesperson added.
""Is it true that a Hong Kong that descends to 'a place of violence' is what they want to see and is it the autonomy and freedom that they want?""
China strongly urges US politicians to observe international law and basic norms governing international relations and to respect the wishes of the majority of Hong Kong residents to fight against violence, protect the rule of law and support the police, the spokesperson said.
China urges them to know their place, immediately make a clear break with the violent radicals and stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs, the spokesperson added.

HK education failing its youth,"That a 12-year-old boy was among the 36 detained for an attack on police officers in Hong Kong on Sunday has drawn much attention. And he is only one of the many juveniles that have been involved in the unrest and rioting that have plagued the special administrative region over the past two months.
The involvement of so many adolescents born after Hong Kong's return to its motherland in 1997 raises a serious question that concerns the future of the city more than the social turbulence itself - what's wrong with Hong Kong's education system?
A glimpse of the primary and middle school textbooks of the SAR shows how ""special"" it is - hard-line dissidents, who are among the authors, editors and compilers of some of the textbooks, have filled them with their personal political views.
These authors feel no qualms about putting distorting spectacles on the noses of students. Torrents of words beautify Western civilization and Hong Kong's colonial history, while demonizing the Chinese mainland. They never mention that the West's rise was on the backs of peoples subjugated by force of arms, or what the mainland has accomplished in its transformation from imperialism and feudalism.
Some liberal education textbooks openly distort the ""one country, two systems"" policy, and incite students to insurrection. In this way, these authors betray the purpose of education, which is to help young people to know about the world, and cultivate their critical and independent thinking.
That such kind of liberal education has been compulsory since 2009 explains why young people in the SAR are vulnerable to secessionist and radical ideas, and can so easily be led astray. No textbooks are perfect, as by their very nature they have to condense and simplify, but they should not be condoning or encouraging lawbreaking behavior.
One of the functions of an education system is to teach young people to be good citizens, the Hong Kong education system is failing in that purpose, as young people are unquestioningly challenging the government and the law, without any regard for the future.
Before waving the Stars and Stripes and the Union Jack in their protests on Chinese soil, Hong Kong youths would do better to first learn how to use their own eyes to see the world and their own minds to understand it. Until there are some substantial changes in Hong Kong's education, its youth won't be able to appreciate their true identity.

West's black hands stir HK turmoil,"If the violent acts perpetrated by some radical protesters in Hong Kong happened in any of the Western countries condoning them, the protests would have been instantly condemned and squashed.
Instead Western politicians and media with an anti-China agenda are conniving with the perpetrators by trying to blur the lines between those for whom freedom of expression is simply the undermining of law and order and those who have taken to the streets peacefully for a multitude of reasons.
It is because Western politicians and media are so eagerly willing to portray their acts in a false light that some in Hong Kong have been emboldened to violate the law with ever more egregious acts of violence. And it is the collusion of these forces with anti-China troublemakers in the SAR that has led to the persistence of the violent disturbances in the city.
While the central government has been patient, aware that there are issues that have come to a head and grievances about future livelihoods that need to be aired, it will by no means allow the chaos to continue indefinitely as it is taking a heavy toll on Hong Kong's rule of law.
Its restraint is out of consideration for the future of Hong Kong and the principle of ""one country, two systems"" but that does not mean it will allow the city to be held to ransom by those, who in their pursuit of media coverage as testimony to their ""suffering"", are willing to continually escalate their violence as badge and banner of their rebelliousness.
Simply because it is spectacle does not give the violence validity. Instead, without due cause, the spectacle simply becomes ever more voracious for sensationalism to justify itself. Should the SAR government require assistance from the central government to restore order, then such help will be forthcoming.
Like any society, Hong Kong's is diverse and people have many different demands. That so many people have been willing to take to the streets shows it is imperative that there is a public channel for people to express their views and make rational appeals. The dialogue platform that the SAR government chief Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has introduced to strengthen communication with all sectors of SAR society will hopefully prove a meaningful trial in the right direction.
What Hong Kong is experiencing is its growing pains as it enters a new era. But with a rising mainland as its steadfast backer, once the city restores calm and stability, it will continue to prosper."
HK officials condemn multiple violent incidents,"Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor sternly denounced on Monday what she called the unprecedented violence in the city on Sunday, saying violence will never be a solution but will only breed more violence.
Lam was condemning the violence during the siege of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR in Sai Wan, Hong Kong Island - Beijing's top representative authority in the city - and the attacks in Yuen Long in the New Territories on Sunday night.
Lam and all principal officials of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government and the commissioner of police met with the media on Monday afternoon.
She said such violent acts are vicious and have caused citywide indignation. She also promised punishment for anyone involved in such acts.
A peaceful protest against the now-suspended extradition amendment bill on Sunday afternoon turned ugly at night as radical protesters besieged the Liaison Office.
They defaced the national emblem mounted at the entrance of the office and painted offensive graffiti on the office's exterior.
Lam said the vandalism is in blatant defiance of the nation's sovereignty and an open challenge to the ""one country, two systems"" principle. It has caused great harm to the SAR, which is governed under the principle, and it hurt the sentiments of people in Hong Kong and on the Chinese mainland.
Lam also strongly denounced the ""astonishing and outrageous"" attacks in Yuen Long in the New Territories. Late on Sunday night, attackers in white shirts, some wearing masks, assaulted bystanders and commuters at the Yuen Long subway station with bamboo sticks and metal poles. They said they were targeting radical protesters who have disrupted local order.
The attackers completely disregarded law and order as they indiscriminately assaulted innocent people, she said, adding that what they did was appalling and totally unacceptable. She requested that the police chief conduct an extensive and in-depth investigation into the incidents and punish those who violated the law.
The SAR government has zero tolerance for any kind of violence at any time, anywhere and toward anyone.
Commissioner of Police Lo Wai-chung pledged that the police investigation will begin immediately, and the force will pursue offenders at all costs in order to bring them to justice.
He also dismissed allegations that the police force acted leniently when facing the violent attackers at the Yuen Long subway station. The police force is against any kind of violence, Lo stressed.
Wang Zhimin, director of the Liaison Office, made the ""strongest condemnation"" of the vandalizing of the office on Sunday night.
Saying that Hong Kong has seen a series of radical protests that exceeded the boundaries of peaceful demonstration, Wang said these acts have challenged the city's rule of law and seriously undermined the fundamental interests of Hong Kong residents.
He said he believed the Hong Kong government and its law-enforcement bodies will punish those responsible according to the law.
Tung Chee-hwa, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said he was saddened by the desecration of the national emblem.
Tung said a small fraction of the community has taken advantage of an inclusive society and deliberately sabotaged Hong Kong's economy and social order in an attempt to undermine relations between the central government and the SAR.
More than 20 pro-establishment lawmakers issued a joint condemnation on Monday of the Liaison Office attack and the Yuen Long violence.
China Daily"
"Beijing decries violence, blows to HK reputation","The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday criticized violence during recent protests in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, saying it tainted the city's image, seriously challenged the rule of law and jeopardized the city's security, stability and public order.
At a news briefing in Beijing, ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying also decried attempts of the city's nongovernmental Civil Human Rights Front to suggest 61 foreign countries and regions issue travel alerts for Hong Kong.
Such attempts are by nature colluding with foreign forces to interfere in China's internal affairs, Hua said. She reiterated that any such interference is intolerable.
Hua's statements came on the same day thousands of black-clad protesters occupied the arrival hall at Hong Kong International Airport, the world's eighth-busiest airport, to stage a massive sit-in protest against the now-suspended extradition amendment bill. Aside from chanting slogans attacking the SAR government, protesters also distributed flyers inside the airport.
Hong Kong is at a risk for another violent protest on Saturday. A planned rally, in response to attacks at Yuen Long metro station on July 21, when white-clad people assaulted commuters and passersby indiscriminately, was rejected by the city's police. However, there is concern that protesters will gather anyway.
Ireland had changed its travel status for Hong Kong to advise a ""high degree of caution"", while Singapore, Japan and South Korea called on its citizens to avoid areas where public gatherings are taking place and to follow local authorities' advice.
The HKSAR's Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung warned against taking part in the Saturday rally, as those joining in might be arrested for illegal assembly, punishable by heavy fines and imprisonment. ""Whether there will be a procession or not, we cannot rule out the possibility of a large number of people turning up. ... But we sincerely wish that the participants would never resort to violence when expressing their discontent and pay due respect to the public order and people's life in Yuen Long,"" Cheung said.
Different sectors also appealed to the public, especially to young people, not to participate in any illegal assembly and never turn to violence.
Many principals of middle schools and university heads signed statements calling for students to avoid the Yuen Long protest.
The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce called on all sectors to clearly draw the line with violent protesters to protect the rule of law.
According to the Public Order Ordinance, any person who convenes, holds, organizes, forms or collects an illegal assembly, or assists or is concerned in doing so, will face the maximum penalty of a HK$5,000 ($640) fine and imprisonment for five years.

Lam says tough times ahead for HK,"Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, cautioned on Tuesday that all sectors of the city will face a ""chilly winter"", as protracted violence has taken a heavy toll on the city's economy and people's livelihoods.
Before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lam told reporters that the social unrest that has lasted for more than four months has created far-reaching societal effects.
Hong Kong is in ""a very dangerous situation"" now, she said, vowing to stem violence with the utmost resolution.
Attacks by rioters brought the city's railway network to an unprecedented standstill on Friday night and through Saturday.
As of Tuesday, MTR, the city's rail operator, provided only limited subway service, and transportation remained chaotic for a fifth consecutive day.
The continued violence also has hit the special administrative region's service industries, one of its economic pillars and the source of many grassroots jobs.
Retail, food and beverage, hospitality and tourism sectors have been particularly hard hit.
Fearing damage, many shopping malls have closed early in recent days. Retail sales saw a 25 percent year-on-year drop in August. Lam also said an Executive Council member from the food and beverage sector has said that mass layoffs, even shutdowns, are expected in local restaurants.
Tourists visiting Hong Kong in August, the usual peak season, dropped by 40 percent year-on-year. During the nation's Golden Week holiday from Oct 1 to Monday, also a peak time for tourism, visitors in Hong Kong were half the number recorded in the previous year.
Lam said the HKSAR government will cut fees and rents for affected industries and provide tax waivers and unemployment allowances to affected residents.
She also called for more supportive measures, especially from commercial property owners and developers, for hard-hit tenants.
Lam expressed hope that Legislative Council meetings will resume as scheduled on Oct 16 to deliberate stalled bills, including livelihood-related projects worth more than HK$100 billion ($13 billion).
On Tuesday, the LegCo announced that work to repair large-scale vandalism by rioters on July 1 is almost finished.
The damage, which extensively affected people's livelihoods and daily lives, also drew opposition from local residents.
A Hong Kong resident surnamed Lau, 45, who works in the service industry, said Hong Kong's tourism sector has taken a hit from the continuation of violent protests. She said the drop in tourist numbers has resulted in one out of four newsstands shutting down on a street where a friend of hers makes a living.
Most owners of the newsstands are in their 60s or 70s, which means it is hard for them to find a different job to support themselves, she said. While Lau said her friend has been able to keep his business afloat, the friend's income has dwindled, providing just enough to eke out a living.
Another resident surnamed Xu, who owns a business in the food and beverage industry, said his business earnings have been severely affected in recent months.
His company used to have monthly revenue of HK$4 million, but that has dropped to less than HK$1 million. Xu said most companies in the industry are seeing expenses exceed income.
The pressure from utility bills and rent has always been considerable in Hong Kong, but it now has become much worse, he said.

HK colonial nostalgia dismissed,"Young protesters don't realize that city is more democratic now, experts say
Amid the ongoing chaos on Hong Kong's streets, the United Kingdom and United States flags have become common symbols of defiance.
Protesters are heard singing the UK's national anthem, God Save the Queen, and the US' The Star-Spangled Banner. The aim in either case appears to be to draw the attention of British and US officialdom to the anti-government campaign.
Many who possess British National (Overseas) passports are even demanding the UK grant them full British citizenship.
One of Hong Kong's most prominent activists, Joshua Wong Chifung, testified in Washington before the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China, urging US lawmakers to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019. It was passed by the US House of Representatives on Tuesday and awaits action by the US Senate. The legislation, if passed by the Senate, would require the US president's signature before taking effect.
In an article published by the South China Morning Post on Sept 23, Mike Rowse, the CEO of Treloar Enterprises, wrote that it is fanciful in the extreme to suppose the US would throw open its doors to large numbers of migrants from Hong Kong.
Rowse, former director-general of InvestHK, a department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government, said, ""It is time for some Hong Kong residents to forget their dreams that outsiders are going to ride in on white steeds and solve all their problems.
""The reality is, we are part of China, now and forevermore. The Basic Law gives us all that we realistically could want,"" said Rowse, who has lived in Hong Kong since 1972. He became the first foreigner from Hong Kong to become a naturalized citizen of China after the handover in 1997.
""Our best course of action is to cherish it, and nourish it. If we run into difficulties, the only capital city worth visiting is our own, in Beijing, not Washington, not London or Berlin or Ottawa or Canberra.""
Among some, there nonetheless remains a yearning for Hong Kong's days under British colonial rule.
However, Peter Bentley, a Hong Kong permanent resident of British origin who has lived in the city for nearly 40 years, said, ""During the British colonial period, which lasted for about 150 years, Britain did nothing to introduce democracy to Hong Kong.""
He added that the British government ignored calls for direct elections after World War II.
Mark Aitchison Young, governor of the colony between 1941 and 1947, proposed political reform in Hong Kong in 1946. He called for the establishment of a municipal council comprising a majority elected from among the public at large. The proposal was shelved in 1952 under Young's successor, Alexander Grantham.
""Actually, Hong Kong is much more democratic now than it was when the British were here,"" Bentley said. ""Now things have actually got better in Hong Kong. We have more direct elections, we have geographical constituencies, we have local district council elections which are all one man, one vote.""
Lau Siu-kai, vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, a leading think tank, said the protesters were not really calling for the return of colonial rule.
""It's more like a tactic,"" Lau said. ""They whitewashed the colonial governance to smear the current administration. This is to pressure the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the central government to meet their demands.""
Lau said the colonial era was not as good as some claim, whether considering democracy, freedom or the rule of law.
During the greater part of the colonial era, neither the governors nor the members of the Legislative Council were elected by the public. Criticizing the government would lead to stern consequences. There also was racial discrimination, with even the courts favoring Caucasians, Lau said.
Some Hong Kong people give British colonial rule the credit for the city's democracy and freedom. However, Lau said, it was not the British colonial government, but the ""one country, two systems"" policy that guaranteed the democratic rights and freedoms of Hong Kong people.
Lau called for more efforts to help young people in Hong Kong gain a clearer understanding of the relationship between the special administrative region and the motherland. ""A good relationship is never a zero-sum game, but always a win-win situation,"" he said.
Daniel de Blocq van Scheltinga, an adviser on China-related matters to both the private and public sectors, said attempts by the protesters to drag the US and British governments into their orbit were becoming absurd.
""This must be the only occasion in post-colonial history where 22 years after the ending of colonial rule, people are waving the old colonial flags while demonstrating, and acting as if a return to colonial rule would be in the interest of Hong Kong people,"" said Scheltinga, who has lived in Hong Kong for over 18 years.
""Such a harebrained idea cannot be excused by the fact that most of the protesters are too young to have real experience of the British colonial administration, under which 'democracy' was a dirty word.""
The fact that the demonstrations are possible in Hong Kong, and even tolerated despite the protesters lacking permits, was ample proof that the rights guaranteed under the Basic Law were being upheld, Scheltinga said.
It is not difficult to see the remains of British influence in the city, although it has long been handed over to China. English is still widely spoken in Hong Kong and, alongside Cantonese, is one of the city's two official languages.
The city has numerous streets named after British public figures and landmarks. Many of these streets share their name with streets in London. For example, Queen Victoria Street, named after the British monarch who reigned from 1837 to 1901, is a one-way street in Hong Kong's Central district and also a well-known street in London.
Hong Kong follows English common law, in which judgments and legislation together form the law. Education today is still largely modeled on the English system.
Francis Lui Ting-ming, professor emeritus of economics and director of the Center for Economic Development at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said the protesters, most of whom have not themselves experienced British colonial rule, glorify it for political purposes.
Since childhood, they have received a defective liberal education, which has been widely blamed for defaming China, Lui said.
He acknowledged deep-seated social problems related to quality of life in Hong Kong, especially skyrocketing housing prices. He said these have hurt young people's confidence in the future, and that with such frustration, they have what he called an unwarranted nostalgia for the colonial era.
Lui urged the government to reform liberal education to help young people get a comprehensive and objective picture of the nation.
In addition, to rebuild confidence, he called for efforts to improve young people's quality of life.
Paul Yeung, a youth political commentator in Hong Kong, cautioned about the negative impacts of such a yearning for colonial rule, which he said has to some degree been overrated and reflects a misunderstanding of some Western values.
Yeung said that in recent years, some ideas, such as democracy, freedom and human rights, which are often highly regarded in Western countries, have become mainstream values of Hong Kong society.
He said he is worried that an emphasis on those values has left little room for other values to exist in the society. Some people holding these values have even attacked others who have views that are different from theirs, he added.
Another factor is that some young people's understanding of these values is superficial, Yeung said, adding that they don't realize democracy has flaws and limits on freedom.
Yeung also said pro-Western sentiments are against China and have fueled separatist concepts in Hong Kong such as ""self-determination"" and ""independence"".
A key reason behind such phenomena is a lack of national identity, he said, calling for more endeavors to strengthen Hong Kong people's sense of national identity.
Unlike their mainland compatriots, many Hong Kong people, due to historical reasons, lack memories of developing with the mainland since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, said Yeung, so maybe it is harder for them to share the sense of pride.
Efforts should be made to enable Hong Kong people to see a broader picture of the country and participate in its development, Yeung added.
Meanwhile, protesters have continued taking to the streets, with radicals resorting to violence, even though the extradition law amendment bill that prompted the initial protests has been withdrawn.
To further deter violence, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region enacted a ban on masks in the city on Oct 5, which makes it illegal for people to wear masks at public assemblies for the purpose of hiding their identity. Violators may face imprisonment of up to one year and a fine of HK$25,000 ($3,190).
At least 90 people have been arrested for violating the new law since it came into effect, according to Hong Kong police.

British hypocrisy evident in HK report,"A parliamentary report released on Monday once again exposed Britain's inclination to interfere in the affairs of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region by professing concern about the rule of law being undermined in the SAR by the ""dangerous erosion"" of the ""one country, two systems"" framework and the independence of the judiciary.
The House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee expressed concern that continuing participation by British judges in Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal could lead the United Kingdom to ""inadvertently appear complicit in supporting and participating in a system that is undermining the rule of law"".
In response, the HKSAR government issued a statement on Wednesday vehemently rejecting the allegations, pointing out that Hong Kong has its own legal system and exercises independent judicial power, including the power of final adjudication, through its own courts.
Stressing that the principle of ""one country, two systems"" is being fully and successfully implemented, the statement said that the SAR's judicial independence is constitutionally protected, as are the fundamental rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents, including freedom of speech and the right of peaceful assembly, ""which are routinely exercised"".
This is not the first time that Britain has made unwarranted remarks about Hong Kong affairs since the protests erupted in Hong Kong in June. It should remember that it no longer has sovereignty, jurisdiction or right of ""supervision"" over Hong Kong. Its remarks are at best discourteous, worse malicious.
It is such encouragement, overt and covert, from foreign countries that has to a large extent emboldened the anti-government protesters in Hong Kong to resort to the violent acts that have brought chaos and disorder to this Chinese city.
If the violence continues, Hong Kong's reputation as a good place to do business will be irrevocably damaged, which will serve no one's interests, including those of Western countries.
It is high time that those who are lending their backing to the protesters in Hong Kong under the excuse of democracy and freedom of speech listened to mainstream public opinion in Hong Kong and lent their voices to calls for an end to the violence and the restoring of law and order in the city.
Britain should accept that Hong Kong is not its ""responsibility"" anymore. If it wants to fulfill what it calls its ""moral obligation"" to the city, it should make it clear that independence is not a realistic option for Hong Kong and that the ""one country, two systems"" framework is the guarantee for the high degree of autonomy it enjoys.
And if, as it says, it is deeply concerned by the events in Hong Kong over the last six months, it should be backing the SAR government's efforts to end the storm of unrest. Instead, Britain continues to incite the violence that is undermining confidence in Hong Kong's rule of law, which has been the foundation for its status as a world city."
Signs of 'terrorism' seen in HK unrest,"149 arrested as unlawful protests continue, violent acts spread over weekend in SAR
Violence has escalated to a point that smacks of terrorism in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China's top authority on the city's affairs warned on Monday.
In Beijing, Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said radical protesters have repeatedly attacked police officers in the past few days and have committed serious violent crimes. Such violence has begun to show the ""first signs of terrorism"", Yang said.
Yang strongly condemned protesters who threw gasoline bombs at police officers on Sunday night.
A very small number of rioters hurled the bombs at police officers at police stations in Cheung Sha Wan, Tsim Sha Tsui and Wan Chai on Sunday night. A police officer was hit by one such bomb thrown by a protester in Tsim Sha Tsui, causing burns to his legs.
An initial diagnosis showed that the officer suffered second-degree burns on 10 percent of his left leg, and first-degree burns on 3 percent of his right leg.
""We express our strong indignation and condemnation of this sinister, reckless and serious crime,"" Yang said.
Such violent acts have brutally violated the rule of law and social order in Hong Kong, seriously threatened the lives of Hong Kong citizens and challenged Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, he added. Such acts must be ""resolutely cracked down upon"" in accordance with the law, and the affairs office firmly supports Hong Kong police enforcing the law and bringing criminals to justice as soon as possible.
The central government's liaison office in Hong Kong also issued a serious condemnation of violent lawbreakers.
""There is no place in the world that would tolerate such atrocious, violent acts. Hong Kong will slide into the abyss if such acts of terror are allowed,"" the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong SAR said in a statement.
The most urgent and common aspiration of the Hong Kong public is to end violence and restore peace and order, the liaison office added.
The past weekend saw illegal protests on Hong Kong Island, in Kowloon and the New Territories, as protesters adopted hit-and-run tactics.
A total of 149 people were arrested for taking part in the illegal protests and suspicion of committing violent acts over the weekend, according to the police.
Fifteen of them were classified as ""extreme violent rioters"". They were arrested in relation to the protests in Causeway Bay on Sunday night. Police said they classified the 15 suspects because they had allegedly used ""lethal weapons"".
Deputy Police Commissioner Chris Tang Ping-keung said the police have zero tolerance for violence.
Meanwhile, around 4 pm on Monday, Airport Authority Hong Kong canceled the day's remaining flights after thousands of protesters swarmed the main terminal building for a fourth day, the biggest disruption yet to the major aviation hub since demonstrations began in early June.
The cancellations came after operations at Hong Kong International Airport had become ""seriously disrupted"" by the sit-in, the authority said.
On the same day, Hong Kong's Secretary for Transport and Housing Frank Chan Fan said in a news conference that the unlawful assembly will lead to enormous losses, damaging the economy and the livelihoods of airport staff, he said.

Rational and calm discussion on Hong Kong extradition bill urged,"Core administrative and business areas of city partially reopened after rioting
Calls for calm and rational discussions on Hong Kong's extradition bill were made on Thursday, after the city experienced chaos and economic losses due to Wednesday's protest-turned-riot.
The appeals came after tens of thousands of demonstrators paralyzed Hong Kong's core administrative and business area to halt deliberation of the extradition bill in the Legislative Council. During the protest, there were several violent clashes between radical demonstrators and riot police.
In a televised speech on Wednesday night, HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor called the protest ""a blatant, organized riot"".
The rioting left 22 police officers and 81 protestors injured. Eleven demonstrators have been arrested for unlawful assembly, assaulting the police, disorderly conduct in a public place and other rioting-related crimes, according to police.
After being paralyzed for all of Wednesday, traffic in Admiralty - the area where the SAR government headquarters, the Legislative Council and many international financial institutions are located - partially resumed on Thursday, with plastic bags, water bottles and umbrellas scattered on the roadway.
The government headquarters will remain closed on Friday due to security concerns.
The scheduled second reading of the government's extradition bill has been postponed to next week at the soonest.
Hong Kong stocks dropped for a second consecutive trading session on Thursday, with market sentiment weighed down by fear that tensions between protesters and police remain high after the city's violent demonstrations.
After an almost 500-point tumble in the morning session, the city's Hang Seng Index cut its losses later in the afternoon and closed down by 0.05 percent, or 13.7 points, to 27,294.
Legislator Wong Ting-kwong, who represents the import and export sector in Legislative Council, called on Hong Kong to return to order soon, saying it will help address the international community's concern over its business environment.
Responding to worries over Hong Kong's stability and judicial independence, Wong said most of them were generated by a lack of understanding of Hong Kong society. He added that the demonstrators' violent methods were threatening public safety.
Wong called on the government to better explain the issue to the public. ""As social stability is restored, I'm confident that international concerns will be allayed accordingly,"" Wong said.
While strongly condemning violent acts by some demonstrators, Commissioner of Police Lo Waichung said the police sincerely hope the public can express their opinions in a peaceful, orderly and lawful manner.
Saddened by the violent conflicts on Wednesday, the Law Society of Hong Kong reiterated that the bill should be debated in a calm, rational and constructive manner, with a view to finding a suitable solution for the benefit of Hong Kong as a whole.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the professional association for solicitors in Hong Kong stressed that the city is a civilized society with a diverse population, where engagement through rational debate has always been respected.
The Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong - the largest political party in the Legislative Council - urged opponents not to deteriorate the already chaotic situation in the council, nor to jeopardize its constitutional duties to scrutinize bills.
Noting that many protestors were of the younger generation, the party stressed that young people today will be the pillars of the city tomorrow. It called on them to stop tearing apart society through extreme behavior, and try to seek constructive measures to remedy the chaos.
In Beijing, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday stressed that it was unnecessary for some people to worry that amendments to Hong Kong's extradition law will affect the international community's confidence in the SAR.
Geng Shuang, spokesman of the ministry, noted that Hong Kong has been a stable and prosperous economy since the SAR's return to the motherland, while the ""one country, two systems"" principle and a high degree of autonomy are being successfully implemented.

G7 Summit once again displays faked unity,"The G7 Summit that ended in the French seaside city of Biarritz on Monday is the latest proof of how irrelevant the forum has become.
That was not a secret even before the summit when French President Emmanuel Macron decided to abandon the idea of having a joint communiqu¨¦ for the first time in the G7 Summit's 45-year history. The memory of US President Donald Trump on Air Force One ordering his representative in Canada not to sign the joint communiqu¨¦ last year must still be fresh.
The sharp differences among the leaders, especially between the US president and the rest, on everything from climate change and the Iran nuclear deal to trade and multilateralism, are known to all.
What's worse is a faked unity that the G7 leaders tried hard to present to the world, including a 260-word declaration. There was unity, though, when the G7 leaders chose to turn a blind eye to many critical issues in the world and not to challenge the US leader on major issues they strongly disagree on.
The declaration says that the G7 is committed to stabilizing the global economy, and promoting opening-up and fair trade. It does not mention the US administration's protectionism, unilateralism and disruptive behavior which are the real threat to global trade and economy today.
Macron did not touch upon that at all at the joint press conference with the US leader after the conclusion of the summit, perhaps in a bid to please the latter. But appeasing and pleasing the US leader is no guarantee that he won't slap punitive tariffs on European and Japanese cars and French wines.
On Iran, the declaration says the G7 leaders fully share two objectives: ensuring Iran never acquires nuclear weapons, and fostering peace and stability in the region. It does not say that the US withdrawing from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal and re-imposing sanctions on Iran are a major cause of the tensions in the Persian Gulf, rather the entire Middle East.
It is ironical that the countries which threw Libya into chaos in 2011 pretend in the declaration that they are the saviors, not the cause of the chaos in the country. There is no confession.
With nothing relevant to agree on, the declaration even reaffirms the existence and importance of the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 on Hong Kong, a reflection that some G7 countries still live in their colonial past. The declaration also says violence in Hong Kong should be avoided. But what we have seen so far is the excessive restraint exercised by Hong Kong police compared with the heavy-handedness and brutality exhibited by French and US police in cracking down on the ""Yellow Vest"" and Occupy Wall Street protesters.
It's a shame that there is no mention in the declaration of the environment or climate change and growing inequality, two major issues that Macron enlisted as key topics for the summit. There is absolutely no mention of the Paris climate accord. There was a pledge of a meager $20 million to support Brazil to fight the Amazon fires. But it was rejected by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
Meanwhile, the US president has sparked controversy in the US by suggesting his own Miami resort as the venue for next year's G7 Summit. But with no substance coming out of the Biarritz G7 Summit, there is really no need to keep the G7 alive, which has been on life support for some time now. G20 is a much more viable forum for the world today.

Mainland airlines step up efforts to aid inconvenienced passengers,"China's civil aviation authority and airlines have been sparing no efforts in accommodating passengers in Hong Kong affected by flight cancellations.
Hong Kong International Airport was forced to suspend all check-ins for departing flights for a second straight day on Tuesday afternoon as protesters returned and brought chaos to the airport, hours after it resumed a limited number of flights in the morning.
The Civil Aviation Administration of China said that efforts will be made to increase the transfer capacity of airports in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to avoid disruption to trips between the mainland and Hong Kong following recent disruptions at the special administration region's airport.
It will enhance flight capacity as well as provide easier access for passengers to reschedule or refund tickets, the administration said on Monday.
Mainland airlines such as Air China, China Eastern and China Southern, all stepped up their efforts to handle inconvenienced passengers. The airlines said Tuesday they will fully refund or help with ticket bookings for passengers affected by cancellations.
Air China, which canceled 22 flights on Monday and Tuesday, said it will arrange extra flights between Beijing and Shenzhen, Guangdong province, on Tuesday to cope with the passenger demand due to the protest at Hong Kong's airport.
The ongoing situation has disrupted travel plans for many passengers and caused inconvenience.
Passengers also expressed deep concerns about their recent trips to Hong Kong amid a massive backlog of flights.
Huang Yanheng, 29, who works at a consulting company in Beijing, plans to travel to Indonesia next week and needs to transfer in Hong Kong.
""I planned the trip almost half a year ago but the woes at the airport still remain. Therefore I had to cancel my trip,"" he said, adding that he will try to avoid nonessential travel to Hong Kong.

HK educators decry protesters' use of students,"Hong Kong's educators on Thursday expressed concern over secondary school students' participation in political assemblies, warning that it is a worrying sign for these juveniles in developing their sense of values.
Their remarks came as hundreds of secondary school students, together with some teachers and parents, rallied at Edinburgh Place in Central by Victoria Harbor in opposition to the now-shelved extradition amendment bill. Some of the participants at the assembly held signs encouraging participation in strikes that protesters plan on every Monday starting Sept 2, the first day of 2019/20 academic year.
Ho Hon-kuen, principal of Elegantia College, a local secondary school, called the assembly a one-sided event, instead of a discussion including different views.
One of the demands made by protesters this summer in the special administrative region - that the government release all lawbreakers arrested during protests - is ""very dangerous"" and goes against the city's longtime core value, the rule of law, Ho said.
Ho warned that such rallies are harmful to secondary school students, who are the future of the city, in developing their value system and ability to think in a comprehensive and diversified manner.
Ho, who also is chairman of Education Convergence, a leading association of local educators, also said it's unreasonable to stage a boycott based on a political stance in secondary schools. No one in the secondary education system, including students, teachers and school officials, should be pulled into any political dispute.
He said he hoped organizers would show some sympathy given the academic pressure on students and teachers.
Wong Kwan-yu, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers, said secondary school students should not be involved in political activities, as these juveniles are not mature enough to handle and comprehend complicated political issues.
Wong warned that their participation in the assembly on Thursday afternoon is a warning sign for the education sector and their parents.
These students could be easily incited, Wong said. Peaceful assemblies and strikes are usually the first step for anti-government protesters to incite immature students into making further moves, he cautioned.
But he said there are some common practices at secondary schools to manage students who are absent from classes. Parents have to submit an application if their children are not able to attend school, and the school will review whether the absence is reasonable.
On Tuesday, Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung reiterated that the Education Bureau is against any form of strike.
No one is allowed to use school as a place to express political demands, nor to draw innocent, underage students into a political vortex and use them as a means to increase the momentum and pressure against the government, Yueng said.
Yuen Long protest
Separately, MTR Corp - Hong Kong's subway operator - expressed regret over illegal acts by protesters at the Yuen Long MTR station on Wednesday night.
In a statement issued in the early hours of Thursday morning, it said that the vandalism that occurred was unacceptable and that it had filed a report with police in connection with the incident.
During the protest, two men were arrested for unlawful assembly outside Yuen Long Station, the police said on Thursday. More than 1,000 protesters had gathered inside and outside the Yuen Long MTR station late on Wednesday.
The protests expressed anger about an attack on commuters at the station on July 21.
Police dispersed the illegal assembly after repeated warnings were ignored, officials said. The protesters then retreated into the station and confronted the police.
The protesters used stickers to block the card readers at subway gates so commuters could not use their transit cards to get out of the station, according to a 31-year-old Yuen Long resident and commuter who identified himself as Chen. He and other passengers left the station through a security exit, as normal exits were blocked by protesters resisting the police.
A resident named Lilly Wang said she took the bus after hearing of the situation at Yuen Long Station. But the bus was stopped near Long Ping Station - 1.4 kilometers from Yuen Long Station - because roads were blocked. She spent another 20 minutes walking home.
The chaos has affected Yuen Long residents' daily lives, Wang said.
Shops along the street that usually are open until midnight were closed. Subway service to Yuen Long Station resumed on Thursday morning, but damage could still be seen at the station, Wang said.
Firefighting equipment such as hoses and extinguishers were taken out and used by protesters. Newspaper boxes and rubbish bins were knocked over. Graffiti on the walls had been temporarily covered with boards.
On July 21, at least 45 people had been injured when a mob in white shirts stormed Yuen Long Station. Twenty-eight people have been arrested in the incident.
Among them, two men were charged with rioting on Thursday for alleged participation in the July attack. They are set to appear at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts on Friday, according to police.

Scholar: Hong Kong's future in the balance,"The demonstrators in Hong Kong risk jeopardizing the special administrative region's future as a vital hub in one of the most dynamic regions in the world, according to a leading China commentator.
Martin Jacques, author of When China Rules the World: The End of the Western World and the Birth of a New Global Order and a senior fellow at Cambridge University, said Hong Kong's position in the Greater Bay Area - a megalopolis which also comprises the Macao SAR, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and seven other Guangdong province cities - offers it immense opportunities.
""The opportunities are vast, and Hong Kong needs to be part of it. This is going to be the most dynamic regional economy in the world,"" Jacques said.
Beijing intends for Hong Kong to be the financial and trade center of the Greater Bay Area, which will be a technology and innovation center where 70 million people live. The development plan for the area was published by the State Council in February.
Jacques believes this is where the future of Hong Kong and also of many of those demonstrating should lie.
""The future of Hong Kong is as part of southern China. That is where it is, and that is what it is and that is what it has to embrace. The people need to think strategically about this and not defensively,"" he said.
Jacques believes that the demonstrators fail to understand this and that they cling to some false notion that vestiges of colonial rule offered them a better future.
""What I fear about these demonstrators is that they are nihilistic. What do they offer Hong Kong? They actually offer it destruction. They walk around with Union Jacks and American flags. Just what do they think they are doing?"" he said.
Jacques said he fully supported the face mask ban imposed by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor on Friday.
""The ban on face masks is entirely appropriate and overdue. Demonstrators should be accountable for their own actions,"" Jacques said.
He said Hong Kong and central government authorities have shown ""considerable restraint"" in handling the violence of the demonstrators, whose actions would not have been tolerated in the Western countries that somehow champion them.
The 217 environmental protesters arrested this week at the Extinction Rebellion attempted to close down London's streets. This is an example of how United Kingdom authorities deal with such issues, Jacques added.
""What if the Extinction Rebellion tried to close Heathrow, as the Hong Kong demonstrators did at Hong Kong International Airport? The British would have sent in a strong force and arrested them all. You cannot tolerate a nerve center of your country being disrupted like that,"" he said.
Jacques, who lived in Hong Kong from 1998 - just a year after the handover from the British - until 2001, said there is a tendency for some in Hong Kong to look westward rather than northward to the Chinese mainland, where their future lies.
""I found many in Hong Kong extremely ignorant about China and even looked down on people from the mainland because 20 years ago they were much richer,"" he said.
Hong Kong's GDP in proportion to the Chinese mainland has slumped from a peak of 27 percent in 1993 to less than 3 percent now.
Jacques believes that the Chinese mainland is being blamed for problems that are actually Hong Kong's own doing.
""Inequality of income and wealth in Hong Kong, which was always sky high, has got worse,"" he said.
He also believes the economy is in stasis, relying heavily on trade and financial services and not embracing technology like the Chinese mainland or similar-sized economies such as Singapore have done.
""While the Chinese mainland has kept reinventing itself, Hong Kong hasn't managed to do that. I mean, basically, what is Hong Kong? It is a financial center, it is tourism and it is a property market,"" he said.
He blames some of this lack of modernization on the British colonial legacy.
""The British legacy is not one of science and technology but of financial services speculation.
Jacques believes the model of ""one country, two systems"" established under the Basic Law of Hong Kong, is one that serves the SAR well and could not have been adopted by a typical Western state.
""China is not in its bones a nation state, but a civilization state. China has always had to accept a great deal of diversity across the country. Nation states such as in the West, where there is much greater homogeneity, would not be able to tolerate that difference,"" he said.
Jacques said the system has worked well because it allows for the flexibility for both Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland to evolve.
""It is not one country on one hand and two systems on the other. It has its own dynamism where the two are in constant interplay, where the situation is not one of stasis.""
Jacques finds it difficult to comprehend how Western media have covered the demonstrations in Hong Kong.
""The Western mentality has been 'three cheers' to the demonstrators, some of which have been really violent. They are like urban guerrillas. How can you support that behavior and have that attitude?"" he said.
""I am not saying that you shouldn't hear them. A significant proportion are young people, so you have got to listen to them. You don't, however, have to agree with them.""
Jacques believes the demonstrations are potentially hugely damaging for Hong Kong with the huge potential the Chinese mainland represents.
One of the next global megatrends over the next 20 years will be the opening-up of China's financial and capital markets, in which the SAR could have a major role.
""It is disastrous for Hong Kong. Shanghai will be the most important financial center for that, but China will need several financial centers and Hong Kong must be part of that - that and its role in southern China's development, where the potential is enormous, should be its future,"" he said.

Clothing brand must come clean on HK 'strike',"ON MONDAY, demonstrators in Hong Kong called for a ""strike"", asking schools, shops, and factories to close for one day in ""protest"" against the local government. Their call elicited little response from Hong Kong residents, but some outlets of clothing brand Zara kept their shutters down. China Daily writer Zhang Zhouxiang comments:
Some photographs on social media networks show some Zara outlets were closed on Monday, prompting some people to reportedly ask Zara to explain why they were closed.
Zara issued a ""statement"" on Monday night via its micro blog account, saying it has always supported the territorial integrity of China and the ""one country, two systems"", and ""never supported any strike"". So why were some of its outlets closed?
The common interests of the residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region lie in maintaining social order and the rule of law, and helping the SAR prosper. The ""strike"" call was aimed at disturbing Hong Kong's social order and harming the city's economy. That's why the majority of Hong Kong residents and businesses rejected the ""strike"" call.
But since its outlets were closed, people might get the impression that Zara supports the demonstrators, and many of them may choose to boycott the brand, causing Zara heavy losses.
In response to Zara's ""statement"" on its micro blog, which is mainly in the Chinese language, one netizen said: ""Please make a statement in English, on Twitter and Facebook."" If the clothing brand issues a statement only in Chinese, some consumers might think it has done so to please Chinese consumers, not out of sincerity.
If Zara really wants to win back the trust of Chinese consumers, it should issue a statement on other social media platforms in English saying it does not support the Hong Kong insurrectionists.

US officials urged to stop meddling in HK affairs,"China asked the United States on Thursday to clarify media reports about a US official's meeting with major ""Hong Kong independence"" activists, urging it to stop sending ""wrong signals"" to the violent lawbreakers in the country's special administrative region.
The Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region urgently summoned a senior official at the US Consulate General, urging US officials to immediately make a clean break from anti-China forces who stir up trouble in Hong Kong, to refrain from meddling in Hong Kong affairs and to avoid going further down the wrong path, according to a statement on the office's website.
Julie Eadeh, a political counselor at the US Consulate General in Hong Kong, was reported to have met Hong Kong separatist leaders in a hotel in Hong Kong on Tuesday. They include Joshua Wong Chi-fung, one of the leaders of the 2014 Occupy Movement.
China is firm in upholding national sovereignty and security and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and in opposing any interference in Hong Kong affairs by any country, organization or individual in whatever form, the statement said.
""We strongly urge the members of the US Consulate General in Hong Kong to abide by international law and basic norms governing international relations, including the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, and observe their obligations as consular personnel,"" the statement said.
The US government stepped up its warnings to US travelers to Hong Kong on Wednesday by updating its travel advisory to Level 2, which urges travelers to ""exercise increased caution"" while in Hong Kong.
Lau Siu-kai, vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies - the nation's leading Hong Kong affairs think tank - said the move is a way to contain China by destabilizing Hong Kong.
The new travel advisory issued by the US will cause another blow to Hong Kong's economy, which has already been seriously dented by the recent mayhem in which the US also played a role, Lau said.
Brave Chan Yung, a Hong Kong deputy to the National People's Congress, the nation's top legislature, refuted the ""evil"" US agenda to undermine Hong Kong's stability for its own interests.
News reports and historical records have revealed that the US has been behind Hong Kong's recent unrest and many other ""color revolutions"" around the world, Chan said.
Local tourism industry leaders also voiced their anger against the travel alert.
Lam Chi-ting, general secretary of the Federation of Hong Kong Trade Unions in Tourism - the tourism industry branch of the city's largest labor union - said the US move is an attempt to hammer Hong Kong's tourism industry, which is one of Hong Kong's major economic sectors, and further restrain the development of China.
Tourism is a fragile business sector and is easily affected by external factors such as social instability. As more than 800,000 people are employed in the tourism and retailing industry, if the industry crashed in Hong Kong, related sectors would be affected, damaging the special administrative region's whole economy, Lam said.
He added that although Western tourists make up less than 10 percent of Hong Kong's tourism market, the US move to raise the travel advisory for Hong Kong will dampen global sentiment to travel to the city and other Western countries may follow suit.
In July, roughly a month after the protests began, the number of tour groups traveling to Hong Kong has slumped amid the city's violent clashes and mass rallies. Tours from the Chinese mainland, which account for about three-fourths of Hong Kong's tourism market, dropped by 40 percent, according to Lam.
From last month, tour groups from Southeast Asia have fallen around 85 percent. There have been no new bookings for tour groups in September, according to Ricky Tse Kam-ting, founding president of the Hong Kong Inbound Tour Operators Association.
Also on Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying urged New Zealand officials to abandon their dual standards and stop condoning separatist acts of ""Hong Kong Independence"" activists in the name of free speech.

Ex-colonial governor's HK comments blasted,"A statement from a person identified as the principal official in the Office of the Commissioner of the Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region rebuffed former British governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten and urged him to respect the facts, know his place and stop telling blatant lies and putting on ridiculous performances.
""Time keeps moving on, but Mr Patten has stood pat, indulging in the faded glory of colonialism and refusing to face the reality that it has been 22 years since Hong Kong's return to its motherland,"" the unnamed official said in the statement on Saturday.
Responding to Patten's remarks about Hong Kong in an earlier media report, the official said that it is shameless and absurd for Patten, who was not democratically elected, to picture himself as a ""guardian"" of human rights and freedoms.
In a signed article published in the Financial Times on Friday, Patten wrote that ""the UK has every right to discuss with China what is happening in its former colony"", and ""freedom of speech has been whittled away"" in Hong Kong.
The statement said Hong Kong people didn't enjoy any freedom or democracy during the 150 years it was under British colonial rule. Instead, ""Hong Kong people, once 'second-class citizens' during the colonial period, have stood up as their own masters with unprecedented democratic rights and freedoms in accordance with law,"" it said.
Hong Kong now has an economy twice the size that of 1997 and has ranked as the world's most free economy for more than 20 consecutive years. Hong Kong ranked 16th for its rule of law in 2018, up from below 60th in 1996 under British rule, it said. ""These are facts that not even Mr Patten can deny,"" the statement concluded.
On July 1, Hong Kong and the international community witnessed violent protests against an extradition bill, including protesters storming and vandalizing the building of the city's legislature. Patten, however, ""turned a blind eye to the violent crime and tried every means to justify the offenders"", the statement said.
""Such condoning of violence is an assault on the rule of law in Hong Kong, in total disregard of the rights and security of the vast majority of Hong Kong residents. It shows not the least sense of justice or morality,"" the statement said. It also reiterated that the Sino-British Joint Declaration, often cited by Patten to pressure the Hong Kong SAR and China, became null when Hong Kong returned to the motherland on July 1, 1997.
The official criticized Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong, for ""overreaching himself and putting up desperate attempts to cause trouble for the Hong Kong SAR and China at large"" for years.
On Sunday afternoon, a group of demonstrators opposed to the now-suspended extradition bill launched a protest march from Tsim Sha Tsui to the West Kowloon high-speed rail station.
The bill, which was intended to plug legal loopholes in Hong Kong's handling of fugitives, was suspended by the government on June 15. In the weeks since, the city has seen its people divided over the issue, as well as protests that frequently involved violence.
The police have arrested a number of people in connection with the violence and other unlawful acts carried out during recent protests.
Secretary for Justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah said on Sunday in a blog post that comments and opinions expressed in the community would not affect the Department of Justice in discharging its prosecutorial duties.

HK dialogue will start in coming week,"Lam says variety of people to join talks on problems in session open to media
The much-awaited dialogue with the people of Hong Kong will have its first session next week, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, chief executive of the special administrative region, said on Tuesday.
Lam said that 100 to 200 people from all walks of life will be invited to next week's talks to discuss deep-rooted problems facing the city, and the meeting will be open to the media. She spoke at a normal news briefing before the weekly Executive Council meeting.
Lam added that the dialogue platform would also include other formats, including discussions with randomly selected representatives and in-depth dialogue with small groups of people from different backgrounds.
Amid the escalation of violent protests that have roiled the city for more than three months, Lam said she considers dialogue to be a key way for society to break the political impasse.
""Communication is better than confrontation,"" she said.
Lam also rebutted allegations that the police selectively arrested only anti-government protesters in recent scuffles while allowing pro-government vigilantes to go free. She stressed that the police force has always enforced the law in an impartial manner and made arrests in strict accordance with the law and based on the facts.
Anti-government protests continued despite the SAR government officially withdrawing the extradition bill. The past weekend saw radicals resorting to extreme acts of vandalism and assaulting people with different political views.
Moody's Investors Service downgraded the credit outlook of Hong Kong from ""stable"" to ""negative"" on Monday, citing doubts about whether Hong Kong can uphold ""one country, two systems"" as the city becomes more integrated with the mainland's economy.
Lam said the government regretted Moody's decision but conceded that the instability and social unrest in Hong Kong would inevitably undermine and adversely affect international perception of Hong Kong.
Hours before Lam spoke to reporters, a commuter train carrying passengers derailed near Hong Kong's Hung Hom station. Eight passengers received nonserious injuries in the incident, five of whom were treated at hospitals.
Two task forces will be set up to investigate the incident, one from the government's Electrical and Mechanical Services department and one from the MTR Corp, the city's sole railway operator.
Alfred Sit Wing-hang, director of Electrical and Mechanical Services, said the investigation into the ""extremely serious"" accident may take three to six months.
The initial investigation by MTR shows that three cracks were found on the track. It was not yet known whether the cracks caused the derailment, according to MTR.
The operator also said foreign experts would be invited to join its independent task force.
After inspecting the derailment scene, Secretary for Transport and Housing Frank Chan Fan told reporters that at present, they wouldn't rule out any possibility, including foul play or tampering. But he said neither could officials speculate on any particular cause until they have a comprehensive and thorough investigation in hand.
At press time, it was not known whether the railway station would be open on Wednesday.

"'Black terror' on rise in Hong Kong, official says","After another weekend of destructive unrest, officials and members of the public of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region condemned the violence that has dragged the city into chaos without a foreseeable end.
Hong Kong Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu said a ""black terror"" had taken hold over the past weekend as the violence became extraordinarily serious and terrorized the city, which ""completely undermined the city's rule of law"".
Lee made the remark at an interdepartmental news conference on Monday.
Some 100 gasoline bombs were hurled at police officers by violent radicals over the weekend. Many rioters set fires in different locations across the city. They attacked police officers with bricks and corrosive liquids. Such acts pose a serious threat to public security, Lee said.
Violent protesters attacked people whose views differ from their own, creating an atmosphere of ""black terror"" in Hong Kong, Lee said.
Authorities have referred to the term terrorism in commenting on the city's prolonged protests against the now-shelved extradition amendment bill.
In mid-August, a spokesman for the nation's top authority on the city's affairs - the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council - warned that violence has shown the ""first signs of terrorism"" in the SAR.
Facing such a severe situation, Lee urged the Hong Kong public to speak out against violence.
Finding an excuse for violence equals encouraging violence, Lee said. It will only push Hong Kong closer to the verge of losing control, he added.
Over the weekend, 159 people were detained on suspicion of committing various offenses, including possessing offensive weapons, taking part in an unauthorized assembly and obstructing or assaulting police officers, police said at a news conference on Monday.
Police said 1,117 arrests had been made in relation to the violent protests that started in June.
Radicals have brazenly subverted the rule of law and disrupted order, Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said.
The government and police will strictly follow up on all those illegal acts and bring the offenders to justice, Cheung pledged.
In another development, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang on Monday dismissed remarks from an EU official and urged the European Union to ""distinguish right from wrong"".
Geng was speaking at a news conference after EU diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini talked about the situation in Hong Kong on Friday.
The protests in Hong Kong have turned radical and violent and have challenged the rule of law and order in Hong Kong, Geng said, adding they have seriously threatened the lives and property of Hong Kong residents, and have violated the red line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
""If such serious and violent crimes happened in Europe, I believe no European country would just sit and ignore them,"" he said.
Also over the weekend, radical protesters paralyzed traffic and disrupted operations at Hong Kong International Airport, where 25 flights were canceled on Sunday, according to Secretary for Transport and Housing Frank Chan Fan.
And more than a third of the city's 90 subway stations were damaged.
Chan said it was ""absolutely unacceptable"" for radicals to ignore the court's interim injunction against protests at the airport and on the subway network.

Violence grips HK following relative calm,"For first time, police officer under assault by demonstrators fires service revolver
After a relatively calm week, Hong Kong devolved again into violent rioting this weekend with at one point on Sunday a police officer surrounded and being assaulted by protesters firing his service revolver.
It was the first time an officer had fired his sidearm in the violent protests, which have been a near daily occurrence since early June.
Despite heavy rain from Typhoon Bailu on Sunday afternoon, hundreds of protesters joined a procession in Tsuen Wan, in the southwestern New Territories. Because of the protest, subway operator MTR Corp temporarily closed the Kwai Fong, Tsuen Wan and Tsuen Wan West stations in the Tsuen Wan area in early afternoon.
After about 3 pm, radicals deviated from the approved route of the march and started blocking roads, paralyzing traffic. About 10 roads in the area were closed and over 70 bus routes suspended or diverted.
Rioters removed railings from roads and used water-filled barriers, bamboo sticks, traffic cones and other objects to set up barriers against the police.
They hurled gasoline bombs and bricks dug up from the pavement at police officers, also pointing laser beams at them. Police condemned the violence.
After repeated warnings, riot police used tear gas and used minimum force to disperse the protesters after 5 pm.
The police also deployed for the first time their new crowd control vehicle with a water cannon.
At about 7 pm, a China Daily photographer's camera lens was broken by a thrown brick. The crowd gradually dispersed after 7 pm. Police arrested some protesters.
As normalcy returned, with public transport service resuming in the eastern Kowloon district of Kwun Tong on Sunday, the scars of the previous day's violent clashes on the streets remained.
Railway service at various stations resumed along the Kwun Tong Line, including Kwun Tong, Ngau Tau Kok and Kowloon Bay stations, and most local stores reopened. Black, abusive graffiti scrawled on roads and walls of buildings were a grim reminder of Saturday's violence, which had shattered the previous weekend's relative calm.
In Kowloon Bay on Sunday, the scene of fierce clashes between demonstrators and police, a sea of refuse left by protesters - including broken umbrellas and dismantled barricades - had been cleared up by workers and stood piled on roadsides.
Some of the ""smart"" lampposts on Sheung Yuet Road vandalized on Saturday were now protected by traffic cones.
Black-clad, masked protesters had sawed off the new lampposts on Saturday. City officials said each ""smart"" lamppost cost about HK$140,000($17,850).
Residents were enraged. A security guard at a building on Tai Yip Street - the scene of violent rioting on Saturday - said the building and some nearby shops and garages were closed on Saturday, and some remained closed on Sunday.
""Some protesters put up roadblocks with metal barricades and bamboo poles on the streets, and we had to pull down the shutters for safety,"" the guard said.
In Kowloon Bay, Tso Tat-ming, a 60-year-old taxi driver, denounced radical protesters who resorted to violence to force the government to meet their demands.
He lamented that not only his business had suffered but also retail and tourism industries were badly hit. Tso said he had been earning about HK$5,000 to HK$6,000 less monthly recently.
""Some residents are scared seeing the protesters blocking main roads and tunnels with their guerilla-style tactics,"" he said, adding that some residents who had tried to reason with the protesters had been attacked.
""Hong Kong is my home. I hope you (radical protesters) don't put the city in jeopardy,"" Tso said.

Rioters target police and mainland brand stores,"Masked rioters went on a destructive rampage across Kowloon in Hong Kong on Sunday, zeroing in on police officers and stores with mainland links with wanton criminality and a range of weapons.
It was the 20th straight weekend of social unrest in Hong Kong.
A video recording showed a black-clad, masked person throwing a petrol bomb from a flyover in Prince Edward into a group of police officers below. A police officer was enveloped in flames but the fire was quickly extinguished.
At least two police stations in Kowloon - in Tsim Sha Tsui and Sham Shui Po - came under severe attack on Sunday afternoon. Mobs hurled over a dozen petrol bombs at the stations.
Around 6:30 pm, police deployed a remote-controlled bomb-disposal robot to detonate a paper box that was suspected of containing explosives. The box, with electric cables fastened around it, was placed on the road one block from the Sham Shui Po police station.
Before detonating the box, the police seized 42 petrol bombs and raw materials for creating paintballs from two vehicles in Tai Po. They did not rule out the possibility they were being prepared for use in the anti-government protests across Kowloon. Two men, age 31 and 34, were arrested at the scene, the police said.
Besides police officers, rioters also turned their ire on stores with mainland links. Household names like snack giant Best Mart 360, Xiaomi Hong Kong, Bank of China, Chung Hwa Book Company and Chinese medicine company Beijing Tong Ren Tang were among the vandalized shops.
Mobs pried open the shutter of Bank of China's Jordan branch and smashed counters. ATMs installed inside were trashed and burned.
The glass windows of a Chung Hwa Book Company bookstore were smashed. The flagship store of Xiaomi - a mainland electronics company - in Mong Kok, which was vandalized by rioters on Oct 4, was seriously damaged again. Rioters pried its shutters open.
An illegal procession on Sunday had West Kowloon Station as its destination. Thirty trains to and from the station were canceled.

China's sovereignty over Hong Kong sacrosanct,"Both the United Kingdom and the United States have expressed concerns about the protests in Hong Kong. But as usual they have chosen to view them through a prism of their own motives. Hence, they talk of freedom of speech and the right to peaceful assembly, while keeping silent on the escalating violence accompanying them.
The Hong Kong they see exists on an alternate timeline, no one viewing the situation objectively will doubt that the protests have now gone far beyond being peaceful assemblies.
And the freedom of expression they are vaunting in their attempts to widen the divide between the two systems has deluded some into thinking they will rule the roost in a separate country - although they might as well ask for the moon since China's sovereignty over Hong Kong is not open to debate.
The UK and the US have cleverly packaged their ulterior purpose in their rhetoric since day one.
And those willing to accept their gifts have been emboldened to plan and carry out the vandalizing of the legislative council of Hong Kong - a symbol of the special administrative region's rule of law. Then, after lying low for a bit, seeing the Hong Kong government's calm response to the rioting, it fortified their nerve; emboldening them enough to point their ambitions directly at Beijing by attacking the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong and defacing the national emblem.
The only stone that is still left unturned on their map of provocation is the barracks of the People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison.
But who knows, for these people are not acting on any noble motives, simply out of spite and hubris and their own allegiances. They have shown that they are willing to go to extreme lengths in their efforts to provoke an enraged response from Beijing.
The restrained response of the central government so far, which has been limited to condemnations of the rioting and calls for the UK and the US to keep their meddling hands out of Hong Kong affairs, clearly indicates it still views the protests as a domestic affair, although with outside interference.
As was the case after the ""Occupy Central"" protests, it will only be a matter of time for the rioters to be held accountable for their actions. The time that they have left for their ugly show - which has been an eye-opener for the whole world to judge for itself the hypocrisy of their appeals - is ticking down.
Neither the UK nor the US has been able to deny its association with the escalation of the situation in Hong Kong, which simply betrays their duplicity."
Peaceful global rallies reject HK 'independence' violence,"Demonstrators in London's Trafalgar Square chant 'one nation, one China'
Overseas Chinese and peace lovers rallied in various cities around the world over the weekend, calling for an end to the violence that has gripped China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in recent weeks.
On Saturday, hundreds of Chinese students and overseas Chinese in the United Kingdom gathered at London's Trafalgar Square to protest the ""independence demonstration"" in Hong Kong.
Demonstrators at London's landmark square waved Chinese flags, sang the Chinese national anthem and chanted ""no violence"" and ""one nation, one China"".
One said he came to express his support for Hong Kong and its police, and his objection to separatists.
The demonstration was organized after overseas students learned that some Hong Kong ""independence"" activists were planning a rally, said an overseas student who declined to be named.
""Many people here cannot see the truth we see. What they see is a purposeful message that is changed by some Western media, and they cannot see what is really happening in Hong Kong,"" he said.
Another student said, ""We only have one China. We do not allow and we will not tolerate any forces, or even some Western powers, to split our country.""
The demonstrations have spread to Australia, as students in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide have spilled over onto the streets of cities and university campuses calling for an end to violence in Hong Kong.
On Saturday, around 3,000 people who were mobilized through social media marched peacefully through the streets of Sydney.
Among banners that said ""Protect Hong Kong, fight against violence,"" one of the group's leaders, Tony Jiang, an Australian of Chinese descent, said ""We came here to stand against the violent riots and the decaying law and order in Hong Kong,"" Xinhua News Agency reported.
Chen Jingye, China's ambassador to Australia, issued a statement on Saturday calling the Hong Kong protesters' actions ""radical, violent and illegal"" and said they were determined to undermine the ""one country, two systems"" principle.
""Their behavior has grossly trampled on the rule of law and social order in Hong Kong, seriously threatened the local residents' lives and safety, severely jeopardized Hong Kong's prosperity and stability,"" Chen said.
He said event in Hong Kong was ""solely the internal affair of China"" and warned foreign governments to not support Hong Kong's radical protesters or interfere.
In the German cities of Berlin, Hamburg and Cologne, peace lovers spontaneously held rallies to show their solidarity and support for Hong Kong over the weekend. Calling for peace and non-violence, Chinese demonstrators chanted slogans such as ""We love Hong Kong, we love China"".
