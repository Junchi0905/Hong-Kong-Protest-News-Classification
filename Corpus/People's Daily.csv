HK chief Lam backs police force in rare media appearance ahead of planned protests,"Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor on Saturday backed the city's police force, saying officers are not fighting alone, as anti-government forces are planning more protests for the weekend.

 In two rare media appearances, on Saturday morning, since protests broke out in June, Lam said the city's police have used appropriate force based on the needs in handling violent protests and that the HKSAR government fully supports the police officers. She also appealed for confidence in the city to get out of the current impasse soon.

 Full support

 ""We will not let the police force fight alone,"" she said in the interview with CRHK, noting that various government departments and leaders, including herself, all support the police force.

 Even though many have praised the city's police force for its professionalism and restraint in response to violent protesters, who constantly attacked officers both physically and verbally, there are also accusations of the so-called police brutality.

 Responding to the accusations, Lam said it was necessary for the police to use appropriate force in their law enforcement work and that accusations against police officers should be based on investigations rather than certain video footage.

 When an audience called-in during the program on RTHK and said with a shaking voice that his heart is broken seeing the society torn apart, Lam was also emotional.

 ""These events have made many people sad and raised doubts, including myself,"" she said but ""we all should have confidence and I hope we could get out of the current difficult situation as soon as possible.""

 The chief executive added that the decision of Chan Tong Kai to turn himself in, to Taiwan authorities, for his alleged involvement in the murder of his girlfriend on the island, is a relief and hopes it could bring an end to the case.

 Chan's case led the HKSAR government to propose a since-withdrawn extradition bill, which triggered the unrest, though protesters have made several other demands, including universal suffrage and probe into alleged police brutality, which some believe to be politically motivated and unrealistic.

 More protests

 However, even as Lam urged the Hong Kong society to end violence and start rebuilding the city, some continue to plan major protests for the weekend that police say could turn violent.

 Hong Kong police on Friday issued a letter of objection to a protest planned for Sunday, citing intelligence that predicts risks of violence and vandalism.

 Ho Yun-sing, district commander of Yau Tsim district police, told a press briefing on Friday that police have received intelligence about the possibility of violence stemming from the planned protest, including the use of offensive weapons such as petrol bombs and homemade explosives, thus endangering public security.

 He warned that participation in the planned protest would be deemed an ""unlawful act.""

 Organizers have appealed against the police decision on Saturday to a panel, the Appeal Board on Public Meetings and Processions, according to media reports.

 However, the HKSAR government is not taking any chances as it announced early closure of public facilities on Sunday in the vicinity of the planned protests.

 ""All facilities of Kowloon Park, the Hong Kong Cultural Centre, and the Hong Kong Space Museum in Yau Tsim Mong District will be closed at noon tomorrow to ensure the safety of venue users,"" the HKSAR Leisure and Cultural Services Department said on Saturday.

 The planned protests on Sunday followed a relatively calm week. On Friday night, some protesters formed a ""human chain"" in certain areas but there were no clashes reported. There were also no major protests planned for Saturday, unlike previous weekends - a sign of losing steam for the ill-intentioned political movement.

 However, the impact of the violent unrest over the past four months on the city's economy has started to show.

 The latest sign of the negative economic impact came as one of the city's oldest and largest trade expo had to make major adjustments to its time and prices due to the unrest.

 While the Hong Kong Brands and Products Expo will kick off on December 10 as planned, the length has been cut to 22 days from 24 days and the closing time has been changed to 6 pm instead of 10 pm, an organizer from the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong, said on Friday. The price for tickets was also cut to HK$8 from HK$12.

 ""Constantly escalating social events in Hong Kong over the past few months have seriously affected public transport network and posed an extremely huge challenge for holding any major outdoor expo,"" the association said, adding extra security personnel will be added to ensure security."
Violence takes its toll on Hong Kong tourism,"The recent protests in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) have taken a substantial toll on the city's tourism and economy, Hong Kong media sources have said.

 The number of tourists coming to Hong Kong has dropped substantially since the protests broke out. In the first five days of August, the figure declined by 31 percent year-on-year, followed by a 33.4-percent decrease over the next five days.

 Paul Chan Mo-po, financial secretary of Hong Kong SAR, said on Aug. 21 that it had fallen to 40 percent between August 11 and 15.

 Many hotels in Hong Kong lowered their prices to entice tourists. For example, it costs between 200 to 500 Hong Kong dollars to book a double room in the downtown area this coming Saturday, about half of the regular price.

 The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions is concerned about the possible job cuts in the tourist industry if the riots continue.

 Considering the plummeting occupancy rate and food-service income, the InterContinental Hotel on the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront sent an email to all employees asking them to take their annual or unpaid leave in August and September.

 The InterContinental Hotel is just one of the hotels to be affected by recent violence in the city. No matter whether we're talking about five-star hotels or cheaper hotels, the situation may continue to worsen, said an insider.

 On top of the blow to the tourism sector, Hong Kong's second-hand house market has also been hit hard. A 35-square-meter house in Fanling Town Center, one of the largest shopping arcades in Fanling, was recently sold for 4.8 million Hong Kong dollars, down 9 percent compared with the seller's asking price."
Hong Kong catering sector badly hit by violent protests,"Shops and restaurants in the Tsim Sha Tsui business district closed after a violent protest during a weekend in August which used to be the peak time for shoppers and diners. Photo: Chen Qingqing/GT

 The ongoing protests in Hong Kong have taken their toll on the city's catering industry, a local survey showed, and people in the sector said they have already felt the chill.

 The Eating Establishment Employees General Union of Hong Kong recently surveyed more than 500 restaurant employees and 90 percent of respondents said the restaurants they work for have been affected by the current social unrest in Hong Kong.

 A weakening global economy and a series of protests that have escalated to violent attacks since June have left many restaurant employees facing unprecedented challenges, according to a statement the union sent to the Global Times on Friday.

 The survey showed that 98 percent of respondents believed the protests were weighing on their businesses, and 47 percent said the revenue of their companies slumped more than 30 percent lately. The survey also found that 51 percent planned to cut jobs to tackle rising operational difficulties.

 The union said that during the past two months, it has handled dozens of cases of restaurant closures. These restaurants were located in various parts of the city and the closures involved more than 700 people and led to the losses of nearly millions of Hong Kong dollars.

 A businessman who runs a clay pot rice restaurant in Mong Kok told the Global Times that summer is usually the peak tourism season, and many tourists used to line up at his restaurant every night until 10 pm.

 ""It's very disappointing this year, you can see. We close the doors around 9 pm as we receive very few people every night now,"" he said.

 During the weekends, the restaurant has to shut its doors even earlier, as black-clad protesters come to the neighborhood and illegally occupy the streets, which has led to a series of intense standoffs with police.

 Xie Yanli works at a restaurant in Mong Kok. She has been a waitress for more than 10 years. She said that she has been affected due to the decline in business caused by the protests.

 In the past, customers would have to line up outside her restaurant at peak times, but now the average daily revenue of her restaurant is less than the lunch time earnings in the past.

 Xie told the Global Times that she used to take one day off per week, but now she has to take two or three days off given the uncertainties.

 ""Sluggish business across the industry has forced many people to leave, pushing up the unemployment rate. However, many youngsters do not realize this and do not value what they have got,"" Xie said.

 Hong Kong's economic growth is mainly driven by the services sector. As one of the pillars in the services sector, catering is facing an unemployment crisis due to the anti-government movement.

 From May to July, the unemployment rate in the restaurant business reached 5 percent, involving 12,900 people. This was much higher than the city's overall unemployment rate of 2.9 percent, making it the sector with the highest unemployment rate, the statement showed.

 The union said it considers the current situation to be the worst ever seen, and it called for the restoration of peace and normality.

 Moreover, the sweeping protests have also cast a shadow on other sectors such as retail.

 A man in his 50s has run a retail stall at Victoria Harbour for more than 10 years. He told the Global Times that most of the tourists he sees are from the Chinese mainland, but since the massive protests began in late June, few people are coming.

 He said that his daily sales have dropped nearly two thirds, from almost HK$2,000 ($255) to only about HK$700, 30 percent of which is his net income.

 ""We are the victims, but we cannot do anything about it,"" he said.

 A salesperson at a Chow Tai Fook store on Nathan Road, the main artery of the bustling Tsim Sha Tsui shopping area, told the Global Times that the store would definitely close earlier if there is a violent protest. The store normally closes at 10 pm."
Unrest-hit Hong Kong outlaws wearing masks in protests,"Chief Executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam attends a press conference in Hong Kong, south China, Oct. 4, 2019. HKSAR government on Friday established an anti-mask law in the latest drive to end the prolonged violence. Lam told the press conference that the government has invoked the power under the Emergency Regulations Ordinance and made a new regulation in the name of Prohibition on Face-Covering Regulation, to ""create a deterrent effect against masked, violent protesters and rioters."" The ban, designed to end violence and restore order, will come into effect on Friday midnight, Lam said. (Xinhua/Lui Siu Wai)

 HONG KONG, Oct. 4 (Xinhua) -- The government of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Friday established an anti-mask law in the latest drive to end the prolonged violence.

 HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam told a press conference that the government has invoked the power under the Emergency Regulations Ordinance and passed the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation to ""create a deterrent effect against masked, violent protesters and rioters.""

 The ban, designed to end violence and restore order, will come into effect on Saturday, Lam said.

 The move added Hong Kong to the list of countries and regions that have anti-mask legislations, including France, Canada and many states in the United States.

 Unrest has raged for more than three months in Hong Kong as radical protesters, often black-clad and masked, set fires on streets, vandalized public facilities including metro stations, and assaulted police, civilians and businesses.

 Lam said violence has escalated to a very alarming level in the past few days, causing numerous injuries, and ""leading Hong Kong to a chaotic and panic situation,"" with more participation of students.

 About 1,100 people have been injured in recent violent incidents, including over 300 law enforcers, according to Lam.

 Although the emergency ordinance has been invoked, Lam stressed that Hong Kong is not in a state of emergency. However, she stated Hong Kong is in extensive and serious public danger. ""It is essential for us to stop violence and restore calmness in society as soon as possible.""

 Elaborating on the new regulation, Secretary for Security John Lee said masks will be banned in assemblies and processions, authorized or not, as well as riots, and offenders are liable to imprisonment of up to one year and a fine as much as 25,000 Hong Kong dollars (nearly 3,200 U.S. dollars).

 People who have to wear a mask for special needs, including for medical, health and religious reasons, will be applicable to exemption clauses, according to the government gazette.

 Advocates for the ban said masks have been used by rioters to conceal identities and escape legal penalties in the drawn-out unrest, leading to a higher level of aggression on their part.

 ""Many police officers and residents were injured in the escalated violence, but the police could not bring all rioters to justice as most of them wore masks to hide identities,"" said Elsie Leung, former secretary for justice of the HKSAR government.

 ""It is the right thing that should be done,"" Leung said, adding that the introduction of the law is in line with the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance.

 Barrister Ronny Tong, a member of the HKSAR's Executive Council, said legal weapons are now needed to quell the mob violence, which escalated on Tuesday and resulted in a 18-year-old rioter being shot and injured while assaulting a police officer.

 Tong called for public understandings that the anti-mask law is not meant to encroach the freedoms of speech and assembly and has no impact on law-abiding citizens.

 The anti-mask law, as a piece of subsidiary legislation subject to a negative vetting, will be firstly established and then tabled in the Hong Kong Legislative Council (LegCo) for discussion. The meeting of the LegCo will be resumed on Oct. 16."
US interference in Hong Kong affairs intolerable,"A series of large-scale demonstrations have broken out in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) since June, and quite a number of them have gone far beyond peaceful protests, causing outrageous violence and disruptions.

 The radical demonstrators besieged and stormed into the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong SAR, vandalized facilities, and insulted the national flag and emblem, and the regional emblem of the Hong Kong SAR.

 The radical forces also attacked journalists and travelers, and assaulted police officers. The violent acts have severely undermined the rule of law, disrupted social order, and hurt Hong Kong’s economy and people’s well-being, as well as the city’s global image.

 Such vicious acts have blatantly challenged the authority of the central government, touched the bottom line of the principle of ""one country, two systems,"" and underestimated the strong determination of the 1.4 billion Chinese people, including the Hong Kong compatriots, to safeguard the country’s national unity and territory and sovereignty integrity.

 Some US politicians played a role behind the escalation of the Hong Kong violent incidents. They made irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong affairs, called white black and trampled on international rules and the conscience of mankind.

 They called the violent demonstrations in Hong Kong “a beautiful sight to behold”, described the violent crimes as efforts to pursue human rights and freedom, frequently met with anti-China rioters, lodged groundless accusations against the central government and the Hong Kong SAR government, incited violence and confrontation, and openly supported illegal forces.

 Such acts of meddling in Hong Kong affairs are flagrant interference in China’s internal affairs, an infringement of the international law and norms in international relations, and obvious hegemonism. It is exactly under the support of certain US politicians that the radical and opposition forces have grown more hostile.

 Hong Kong is a part of China and its fate is closely tied to its motherland. In the past 22 years since Hong Kong’s return to China, the “one country, two systems” framework has been widely acknowledged as a successful practice in Hong Kong. Last year, the gross domestic product in Hong Kong reached $360 billion, over twice of the 1996 figure. The number of visitors to Hong Kong soared to more than 65 million, over six times that of 1997.

 Hong Kong has been recognized as a global center of finance, trade and shipping. It ranks among the top in the world by various economic and social development indicators. With the construction of the Belt and Road Initiative and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, Hong Kong will embrace new development opportunities.

 Hong Kong’s future lies only with China, as British scholar Martin Jacques noted. China’s fast and sustained development has provided valuable opportunities, inexhaustible driving force and vast space for Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s future depends on fully and faithfully implementing the principle of “one country, two systems” and the Basic Law, actively participating in the country’s development and sharing the development outcomes.

 Stopping violence and restoring social order meets the expectation of people. Certain evil-minded people in the US played dirty tricks, but the fact will prove that their attempt to ruin China and roil Hong Kong will in no way succeed.

 The Chinese government and the Chinese people have the confidence and capability to firmly safeguard national sovereignty, security and unity and protect Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability. Any acts that challenge the bottom line of the “one country, two systems” principle will never be tolerated."
Hong Kong protests: The unseen truth ignored by biased media,"As violence erupted on a 12-consecutive weekend in Hong Kong, a picture showing a large group of journalists cornering a solitary police officer while indifferent to the nearby chaos went viral online, helping the public see the truth hidden behind biased cameras.

 Initially published by People’s Daily on its Sina Weibo on Aug. 24, the picture was taken right after thousands of protestors gathered in Kowloon, vandalizing smart lampposts, as well as attacking local police officers using iron bars and bricks.

 In the picture, a police officer was taking notice of the ongoing violent attacks at a street corner, holding his gun; while dozens of journalists, without paying the slightest attention to the nearby vandalism and mobs, surrounded the police officer and casted their flashlight only on him.

 Some Hong Kong media outlets later depicted the police officer as “the riot police officer who aims at protestors.” Ironically, as if coordinated, they all brushed aside or downplayed the mobs’ violent attacks.

 The picture is not the sole evidence of their biased reports on Hong Kong. Western media outlets, for instance, The Guardian, published an article on Aug. 24 about the latest violence in Hong Kong. Large-hearted on the mobs’ violence, the article used “HK riot police beat protestors” as its eye-catching headline, while to the similar protest that happened in Portland, US, on Aug. 17, media simply downplayed the fact that police in the US also arrested some protestors, adding that the protests led to “sporadic violence.”

 Due to biased media’s continuous efforts to tarnish the image of Hong Kong police, as well as underestimating the severity and truth of the mobs’ violence, Hong Kong police, once the heroes protecting the city’s security and stability, have become the prey of some unscrupulous media, with their justified moves criticized, and their family members threatened.

 During an interview with People’s Daily Online, Martin Jacques, a research fellow at Cambridge University, said that media outlets in the UK have been overwhelming pro-demonstrations and against both the HKSAR and the Chinese central government.

 “I think the Western attitude is definitely encouraging the opposition in Hong Kong, because I think the demonstrators are essentially their audience. The audience they have in mind are actually the western audience,” he said.

 Even the public in Hong Kong have arranged several protests in response to the media bias. According to Sing Tao Daily, many Hong Kong residents arranged rally on Aug.13, calling for unbiased reports from local media and stressing that media should be neutral in their reporting."
"Hong Kong's anti-mask law a necessary move for social stability, experts say","BEIJING, Oct. 5 (Xinhua) -- It is necessary for the government of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to establish on Friday an anti-mask law in its latest bid to end the prolonged violence, experts and overseas Chinese worldwide said.

 HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam confirmed that her government has invoked the power under the Emergency Regulations Ordinance and passed the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation. The ban, designed to end violence and restore order, will come into effect on Saturday.

 Hugh H. Mo, former deputy police commissioner of the New York City Police Department (NYPD), said such a move by the HKSAR government is necessary, adding that the purpose of the violent protesters in Hong Kong is to confront police, not to protest in peace, and these people would have been arrested if they were in New York.

 He also noted that many U.S. states have similar laws, and so does New York City.

 ""A certain part of the protesters deliberately commit unlawful actions. In such a case, it is the most beneficial for them to remain anonymous,"" Russian political analyst Yury Svetov said.

 ""If you hide your face, then you understand perfectly well that what you are going to commit is something illegal,"" he said, adding that the covering of faces to hide rioters' identity must be forbidden by law.

 Pierre Picquart, a China expert at the University of Paris VIII, said the face-covering rioters in Hong Kong have used violence to attack police, disrupted social order, and wreaked havoc on local businesses, enterprises and communities.

 He also said that it is always necessary in all countries worldwide to protect government bodies, citizens and public properties, and to maintain public order.

 Deng Zhuting, president of London Chinatown Chinese Association, said he firmly supports such a legislation, and believes that the HKSAR government can use the anti-mask legislation to end chaos and restore tranquility and prosperity in the city."
CE Carrie Lam says 'clear-cut no' to resignation talk,"HONG KONG - Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor firmly refuted Tuesday media reports hinting at her broaching the subject of possible resignation in a private conversation.

 Speaking to reporters ahead of the weekly meeting of her Executive Council, Lam said: ""From the beginning till now, I have never tendered my resignation to the Central People's Government.""

 Lam reaffirmed that she had never contemplated resigning as she took questions from reporters. ""Let me say it in a clear-cut manner: No,"" Lam said.

 In an unambiguous message, the CE said: ""In a private session, I just attempted to explain, as an individual, given the very difficult circumstances, it (resignation) might be an easy choice to make. But I told myself repeatedly in the last few months that I and my team should stay on to help Hong Kong in a very difficult situation and serve the people of Hong Kong. That remains my position.""

 The CE began her press meet by urging protesters to desist from disrupting train services.

 During the past weekend, riotous mobs vandalized the city’s public transportation systems, and the traffic around the airport and Tung Chung was put to a standstill.

 While appealing to protesters not to sabotage railways, Lam thanked MTR staff for resuming the metro services shortly after the illegal acts of vandalism.

 She apologized to travelers affected by protests, asking them to keep visiting Hong Kong and continuing to do their businesses in the Asian financial hub.

 Thanking teachers for their hard work, the CE said the start of the new school year had been smooth despite the turbulence over summer.

 She said Hong Kong is confronted with an economic downturn, and therefore it is time to put aside disputes and work together to save Hong Kong out of the current predicament."
Hong Kong riots wouldn't take place without Western support: Russian expert,"The violent protests in Hong Kong are, in essence, a continuation of pressure on China exerted by certain Western countries, Grigory Trofimchuk, a Russian expert in the field of foreign policy, defense and security, said in a recent interview with People's Daily Online.

 Trofimchuk believes that the riots taking place in Hong Kong began with protectionism provoked by the United States a few years ago. In his opinion, the purpose of certain western countries to support Hong Kong violence is to test China's reaction and provoke the Chinese government into making a harsh response.

 However, the Chinese government has responded to the riots appropriately within the framework of the law, curbing the momentum of destructive provocation.

 The violent behavior of the rioters, including attacking police stations and police officers on August 24, is proof that the agenda of those who wanted to destabilize Hong Kong will not succeed, Trofimchuk said.

 Because of this, radical forces chose to escalate the violence by attacking reporters to garner more extensive attention from international media, he added.

 The Chinese government allows people in Hong Kong to express their opinions under the framework of the law. As the rioters have caused chaos in Hong Kong and undermined the city's stability, the police must take action to end violence.

 The Hong Kong violence wouldn't happen without the support of Western countries, Trofimchuk said. Such large-scale actions are inseparable from careful organization, unified requirements and long-term financial support."
"Over 470,000 people in Hong Kong say ""no"" to violence","People from all walks of life take part in a rally to voice their opposition to violence and call for restoring social order, expressing the people's common will to protect and save the city at Tamar Park in south China's Hong Kong, Aug. 17, 2019. (Xinhua/Lui Siu Wai) 

 HONG KONG, Aug. 17 (Xinhua) -- ""Anti-violence!"", ""Save Hong Kong!"" Over 470,000 people gathered on Saturday in a rally held at Tamar Park, Admiralty of Hong Kong, to voice out their demand for peace and stability in Hong Kong.

 At around 4 p.m. local time, the metro station near Tamar Park was swarming with people. An hour later, the rally started as the Chinese national anthem was ringing out.

 Waving the Chinese national flag and the flag of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and holding signs written with slogans including ""Stop Riots"", ""Anti-violence"" and ""Save Hong Kong"", the crowd was enthusiastic and impassioned despite the rain. They chanted the slogans to express their views.

 At the beginning of the rally, a video was played, featuring a recording of a policeman's wife who spoke, choking back sobs, of how violent protesters stormed the police stations and attacked the police. She appealed to the public to support the police and Hong Kong during this difficult time. ""Police, keep it up!"", ""Save Hong Kong!"" the crowd cried out at the end of the video.

 Tam Yiu-chung, a member of the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress, called upon people from all walks of life to firmly oppose violence.

 The national flag and emblem represent the dignity of the country, and those who insult the national flag and emblem are turning themselves into enemies of the people in the whole country, Tam added.

 Rebuking the recent illegal assemblies and violent acts at Hong Kong International Airport as ""the ugliest riot in the world"", Maria Tam Wai-chu deputy director of the National People's Congress Standing Committee Basic Law Committee from Hong Kong, stressed that everyone should respect the freedoms of others and the exercise of freedom does not include wanton destruction of public properties or obstruction of public transport.

 Wong Kam-leung, chairman of Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers, said that the violence in Hong Kong has been escalating over the past two months and he was distressed to see young people using force and violating laws.

 He called on the young people to ""stop and think twice"" before engaging in violent or illegal acts.

 A 57-year-old gardener surnamed Chan said sometimes she could not go to work because radical demonstrators disrupted the traffic, ""which was very annoying.""

 ""Hong Kong has always been a peaceful society. I hope the extremist radicals stop violent acts so that people can return to peaceful life,"" she said.

 A finance professional surnamed Lee said his business has been badly hit by the illegal demonstrations since many of his clients are too concerned to invest in Hong Kong.

 ""The common aspiration of the overwhelming majority of people in Hong Kong is that the violence and chaos will stop soon. Our community has been torn apart and can not afford any more of it,"" he said. ""We urge the demonstrators and mobs to stop it immediately; otherwise, the whole community has to pay for the consequences.""

 A local resident, Wendy, a mother of a young boy, told the reporter that her life was largely affected by the violent protests going on in the recent two months.

 ""For the sake of our future generations and Hong Kong getting back on track, we refuse to be in silence, we must let the world hear our voice,"" she said firmly.

 The assembly ended at around 6 p.m. local time, with the participants singing the chorus Below the Lion Rock, a famous song in Hong Kong that represents the spirit of unity and hard-working."
Pence's Hong Kong threat will not intimidate China,"On Monday, US Vice President Mike Pence said in a speech that if Beijing wants a deal with the United States it must honor its commitments, including China’s commitment in 1984 to respect the integrity of Hong Kong’s laws through the Sino-British Joint Declaration. He also said that it would be harder for Washington to make a trade deal with Beijing if there was violence in Hong Kong. His speech was another cheap attempt to force China’s hand.

 Recently, US officials have stepped up their attacks on China and tried to link the trade talks to the protests in Hong Kong, but Pence’s speech was the clearest and most arrogant attempt to conflate the two issues.

 Hong Kong affairs are China’s internal affairs. Put simply, this means that the United States should not poke its nose into Hong Kong affairs. It also means that Pence does not get to dictate to China how it should solve the current problem in Hong Kong.

 Under the Trump administration, the United States has been ramping up the pressure on China. The administration launched a trade war against China last year and keeps escalating the trade war by imposing additional tariffs. The administration also has taken aim at Huawei and other Chinese tech giants to maximize American technological power.

 The pressure campaign clearly is not working. Despite the pressure, China’s economy continues to grow, and the trade war with China has only pushed China to be more self-reliant and to focus more on technological innovation. In other words, the pressure campaign is making China stronger, not weaker.

 Anti-China hardliners in the United States like Pence probably realize at this point that their strategy is a failure, but this has not stopped them from ratcheting up the pressure. However, with limited options available, they are resorting to other means, including linking the current problem in Hong Kong to the trade talks.

 There are deep divisions among the American people on how to respond to China’s rise and the fragmentation of political power in the US system is a challenge for long-term and even short-term US foreign policy goals. These divisions and challenges have become even more prominent as the trade war with China drags on and the tariffs take a bigger bite at home. Things will only get worse as we near 2020.

 China is a favorite political punching bag during an election season. As the next US presidential election approaches, the word China will constantly come out of US politicians’ mouths and they will exaggerate the threat from China to score political points and to divert attention away from problems at home. Ramping up the anti-China rhetoric will make voters feel good, but will do nothing to fix America’s problems.

 The US strategy is making the whole game more chaotic. The Trump administration wants to revive the domestic economy, but it has chosen conflict with China. With no end in sight to the trade war, the United States is trying to hit China from all sides.

 Pence’s speech was outrageous. Linking the trade talks with Hong Kong will not bring the two sides closer to a trade deal. The Trump administration is hoping that China will cave into the pressure, but it is naive to think the threat of conflating the two issues will force China to make concessions. The Hong Kong issue is about China’s sovereignty, and China will never bargain with Washington over issues involving its sovereignty."
"Overseas Chinese stage peaceful rallies voicing ""Protect Hong Kong"" from violence","BEIJING, Aug. 20 -- Throughout the past week, overseas Chinese held several peaceful rallies around the world to voice out their call for an end to violence in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).

 On Aug. 11, hundreds of Chinese Canadians in the Greater Toronto Area launched a large-scale rally at the Markham Shopping Center Square to call for stability, prosperity and peace in Hong Kong.

 The most pressing and overriding task of Hong Kong is to stop violence, end the chaos and restore order, they said, adding Hong Kong police have showed their professionalism in coping with the violent protests.

 ""I would like to take this opportunity to pay our high respect to the outstanding Hong Kong police officers who have been on the job, performed their duties, showed no fear and endured a lot of humiliation,"" said Weng Guoning, president of the Confederation of Toronto Chinese Canadian Organizations.

 On Saturday, around 3,000 people, mostly Chinese students, marched peacefully through the streets of Sydney in a rally themed ""Stop Riots in Hong Kong.""

 Holding placards written with slogans including ""Protect Hong Kong, Fight Against Violence,"" the large group chanted ""we love China, we love Hong Kong,"" and sang the Chinese national anthem along the way.

 ""We came here to stand against the violent riots and the decaying law and order in Hong Kong,"" said Tony Jiang, an Australian citizen of Chinese descent.

 ""I think those rioters should stop what they are doing and truly talk to the government, not using violence. Talking is the way. Violence is not,"" a female organizer who asked to be referred to as CC told Xinhua.

 ""This is not peaceful at all,"" she said.

 ""We are all Chinese. There is only one China ... We are all brothers and sisters,"" said a Chinese-Australian citizen named Ray.

 On Sunday, San Francisco also witnessed overseas Chinese gathering to express their firm objection to violence and strong support for the HKSAR government and Hong Kong police.

 Hundreds of overseas Chinese held a peaceful rally at Union Square in downtown San Francisco to support Hong Kong as an indisputable part of China and oppose the violence committed by the rioters in the Chinese special administrative region over the past few weeks.

 The participants, mostly young people including students, white-collar workers and business owners, came from different parts of the Bay Area to express their patriotism and zero tolerance of violence by radical protesters in Hong Kong.

 Any attempt by some extremists in Hong Kong to promote the so-called ""Hong Kong Independence"" must be opposed, said Vivian Liu, a designer with a local wedding company.

 ""As a Chinese living outside of China, we have the obligation to come forward to support our own country when those people with ulterior motives are launching a smear campaign against China,"" said Wang Zhonghan, a student at City College of San Francisco.

 ""How could there be justice when violence is what is exercised, and how could there be freedom when law and order is compromised,"" said Chino Yang, a Chinese American rapper, who is also one of the sponsors of the rally.

 On the same day, overseas Chinese and Chinese students in London also attended a rally at noon to voice out their demand for peace and stability in Hong Kong despite bad weather.

 ""I love Hong Kong, I love China,"" ""One China,"" chanted the crowd in Mandarin, Cantonese and English while holding placards written with slogans including ""Stop Violence"" and ""Save Hong Kong.""

 ""We want to take today's opportunity to express our dissatisfaction with 'Hong Kong independence' and violence,"" said Zhang Yanqian, a student from Kingston University who participated in the rally.

 ""We speak the same language and keep the same blood. We should unite and make the motherland prosperous and strong,"" he said, voicing their hope to show their patriotism through the rally.

 On Sunday afternoon in downtown Boston, hundreds of people gathered at the State House and then marched to Chinatown, waving the Chinese national flag, holding banners, and chorusing the Chinese national anthem and many other Chinese songs to show their backing for solidarity and unity.

 ""There is no police brutality,"" said overseas Chinese Yu Qicheng during the rally, rejecting rumors spread by some violent protesters of Hong Kong.

 ""The brutality has been inflicted on ordinary Hong Kong people and people visiting Hong Kong by those violent protesters,"" he said."
San Francisco groups protest U.S. passage of Hong Kong-related bill,"SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 17 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of three advocacy groups in San Francisco Bay Area Wednesday protested U.S. interference in the internal affairs of China's Hong Kong and presented a ""letter of opposition to H.R.3289"" to the office of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi here.

 ""The prolonged rioting of four months has made life dangerous, intolerable and uncertain for residents of and visitors to Hong Kong,"" according to the protest letter.

 It accused some U.S. lawmakers of instigating dissension and indirectly encouraging illegal protests and violence (in Hong Kong), instead of urging calm and peace.

 ""We urge the lawmakers to pay attention to our own domestic problems such as homelessness, inadequate health care, climate change, housing crisis in metropolitan cities, and rising poverty level,"" said the protest letter.

 John Walsh, a representative of East Bay Chapter 162 of Veterans for Peace (VFP), a global organization advocating world peace, said the Hong Kong-related bill, or H.R.3289, which was passed in the lower chamber of Congress on Tuesday, ""definitely did not reflect the opinions of the general public of the United States.""

 He said he supported the other two groups, Chinese-Americans for Peace, a local grassroots organization, and Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association (CCBA), the largest and oldest organization in San Francisco's Chinatown, in presenting the protest letter to the office of Pelosi, who represents San Francisco in the U.S. Congress.

 The United States has been interfering in the internal affairs of Hong Kong through organizations funded by the U.S. government, such as the U.S. National Endowment for Democracy, he said.

 ""What kind of an attitude is that? That's very hypocritical. Non-interventionism, not intervening in the affairs of another country should be a U.S. policy,"" Walsh stressed.

 Chu Wen Huang, presiding chairman of the CCBA in San Francisco, told Xinhua that the bill was not based on facts and that the U.S. government has turned a blind eye to the rioters in Hong Kong who attacked Hong Kong police officers and destroyed public facilities.

 The bill was not aimed at helping the Hong Kong Special Administration Region (HKSAR) government resolve problems, but rather intends to sanction Hong Kong, he said.

 ""We must not allow foreign forces to meddle in the affairs of Hong Kong and strongly demanded the U.S. Congress withdraw the bill,"" Huang said.

 Leon Chow, vice president of the Committee to Promote the Reunification Of China San Francisco Bay Area Chapter, who was one of the representatives delivering the protest letter, described the escalating violence committed by some rioters in Hong Kong as something smacking of terrorism.

 ""The U.S. legislators should not have passed a Hong Kong-related bill without solid information about the true reality in the city,"" Chow said.

 On Wednesday, the National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, strongly condemned the U.S. House of Representatives' passing of the Hong Kong-related bill.

 The move constituted ""blatant interference in Hong Kong affairs and gross intervention in China's internal affairs,"" the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee said in a statement."
Hong Kong police arrest 149 people during protests in last few days,"A journalist records evidence items presented by police at police headquarters in Hong Kong, south China, Aug. 12, 2019. The Hong Kong police said on Monday that they have arrested 149 people during the series of violent protests over the past few days. (Xinhua/Wang Shen)

 HONG KONG, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong police said on Monday that they have arrested 149 people during the series of violent protests over the past few days.

 Tang Ping-keung, deputy commissioner of police, said at a press briefing on Monday that during the series of protests, radical protesters acted lawlessly and escalated the level of violence. They have spread the violent acts across Hong Kong, causing serious inconvenience towards the general public's daily life and posing threats to people's safety.

 The 149 people, arrested between Aug. 9 and Aug. 12, comprise 111 male and 38 female, aged between 15 to 53. They were suspected of crimes including unlawful assembly, assault on policemen, obstruction of police in the execution of duty, possession of offensive weapons and dangerous objects.

 Tang said that on Aug. 11, some people turned a deaf ear to the police's objection and got involved in unauthorized rallies. Some of the protesters later went to different places all over Hong Kong and blocked main roads and thoroughfares, besieged police stations and damaged police vehicles.

 In Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon Peninsula, a mob threw petrol bombs into the police station, and the legs of a policeman were burnt by fire consequently.

 The police noticed that some protesters were involved in extremely violent activities, and therefore they carried out intelligence-led operations and arrested 15 core members of the mobs on Aug. 11 in Causeway Bay, the Hong Kong Island.

 Tang called on protesters to stop using violence to disturb Hong Kong's social order and he hoped that the Hong Kong society can soon restore calm."
"Overseas experts voice support for China's stance on HK issue, urge end to chaos","BEIJING, Nov. 16-- Overseas experts and scholars voiced their firm support for the Chinese government's stance on the Hong Kong situation, expressing the hope that violence could be stopped quickly and stability could return to the city as early as possible.

 While attending the 11th BRICS summit in the Brazilian capital of Brasilia on Thursday, Chinese President Xi Jinping voiced the Chinese government's stance on Hong Kong's situation, saying that the most pressing task for Hong Kong at present is to bring violence and chaos to an end and restore order.

 Anatoly Tozik, former Belarusian ambassador to China, said he absolutely supports China's stance on the Hong Kong issue.

 What violent criminals did in Hong Kong has gone far beyond normal demonstrations and laws, Tozik said, noting that current protests and activities in the city have shown a sign of extremism and terrorism, and can not be allowed to continue.

 Tozik, who is also chairman of the Belarus-China Friendship Society, noted that Hong Kong is China's territory and the Hong Kong issue is an internal affair of China. Any external interference on the issue could not be allowed, he added.

 Adhere Cavince, a Kenyan expert on international relations, said the continuous violence and criminal acts in Hong Kong caused severe damage to the city's stability and prosperity.

 The disorder has troubled Hong Kong and if the violence goes on, it will further undermine Hong Kong's economy, and then, destroy people's livelihood, Cavince said.

 In the eyes of Edwin Sakala, a political expert from Zambia, what is going on in Hong Kong is unacceptable and must be put to an end.

 ""What is happening in Hong Kong is a gross abuse of democracy,"" Sakala said, adding that there was no way the illegal protests could be allowed to go on at the expense of development.

 Commenting on Xi's latest remarks on the Hong Kong situation, Avtandil Otinashvili, chief editor of Georgia's Newsday website, said Xi's words pointed out a clear way to restore order in Hong Kong.

 The continuous violent activities in Hong Kong have trampled the rule of law and social order, and will harm the fundamental interests of the Hong Kong citizens, he said.

 The chief editor called for efforts to end the expanding violent and criminal acts and bring the offenders to justice, so as to restore social order in Hong Kong."
All sectors in Hong Kong cheer on SAR government to stop riots with law enforcement,"Hong Kong legislators signed a joint statement on Sept. 1, denouncing the ""insane acts"" of radical protesters during illegal demonstrations across the city.

 In the joint statement, a total of 39 lawmakers from the pro-establishment camp restated their stance supporting Hong Kong police in stopping violence and restoring the social order using any effective measures.

 Facing escalating violence, many social organizations voiced their support for the SAR government and police officers.

 The Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong said in a statement that radicals are trying to coerce the SAR government and Hong Kong citizens with escalating criminal acts. The safety of law enforcers and innocent citizens is under severe threat, and many businesses have been forced to close for the time being.

 To stop violence, the Alliance urged the Hong Kong police to arrest criminals as soon as possible.

 The Hong Kong Federation of Railway Trade Unions suggested that shutting the MTR stations in the vicinity of protests endangering people's safety.

 The Hong Kong Chinese Importers' & Exporters' Association (HKCIEA) slammed radicals for their violence and the severe damage caused to the city's economy as well as people's wellbeing.

 Seeing the police officers hit by protesters time and again, former police chief Andy Tsang Wai-hung called on all citizens to help arrest the criminals and encouraged the police force to continue safeguarding Hong Kong with perseverance and fearless spirit.

 The demonstrations have lasted nearly 90 days, said Dr. Chow Man Kong, Secretary-General of Hong Kong Higher Education Convergence. He told People's Daily that the support for the SAR government in stopping violence and riots and restoring public order through law enforcement is high in Hong Kong."
Concerns over unrest haunt Hong Kong's Lan Kwai Fong on Halloween,"HONG KONG, Oct. 31 -- Lan Kwai Fong, a famous nightclub zone in Hong Kong's Central district that is popular with Halloween revelers, saw a low-profile Halloween eve on Thursday, as many restaurants and bars closed early for safety concerns due to an unauthorized protest.

 Posts on LIHKG, an online forum frequently used to initiate illegal demonstrations during the months-long unrest in Hong Kong, have been calling for a march on Thursday evening from Victoria Park in Causeway Bay to Lan Kwai Fong.

 The Hong Kong police have warned that the planned march is an unauthorized assembly that will pose serious threat to public order and public safety, and reminded shops in the vicinity to be updated with the latest situation and close earlier if necessary so as to ensure the safety of lives and properties.

 Unlike previous years, Lan Kwai Fong was not heavily decorated for Halloween this year, while rows of water-filled barriers were deployed as a precaution on the narrow streets and policemen with riot-control gears could be seen at different intersections in the area before nightfall.

 Road closure measures were implemented much earlier than previous years in the area. Several streets around the area were closed from 2 p.m. on Thursday to 6 a.m. Friday.

 The MTR Corporation, the operator of Hong Kong's mass transit railway, also said earlier Thursday that considering the risk level for this day, the Central Station near Lan Kwai Fong would be closed from 9 p.m. local time.

 Concerns for safety have left many shops in Lan Kwai Fong with low expectations for business on the Halloween eve. A waiter of a restaurant surnamed Lee said the number of customers might decrease by over 60 percent compared with the same period of previous years.

 Lan Kwai Fong Association, a non-profit organization that groups over 100 businesses in the area, said there would be no special promotion for Halloween this year due to the recent social atmosphere in Hong Kong.

 As the prolonged unrest gripped Hong Kong for over four months, the restaurant and bar sector has seen a remarkable decline in the number of both local customers and visitors, and hundreds of businesses in the sector have been forced to shut down across Hong Kong.

 In Lan Kwai Fong, some restaurants that used to be busy were also found closed with leasing ads on their reel gates.

 Restaurants and bars were not the only businesses that were suffering. At one entrance of the area, a costume vendor surnamed Wong told Xinhua that he expected a fall by more than half in his sales for the festival this year compared with previous years.

 ""I don't have high expectations this year. I just hope the community will return to normal soon and the business for next year will improve,"" he said."
Find a way out for Hong Kong,"Hong Kong has been put in chaos for about 100 days. While many of the arguments of the violent protesters become increasingly invalid, the truth gradually comes out in the wash. What actually happened in Hong Kong? Where is the way out?

 If what they want is merely to oppose the amendments to the extradition law, then the protesters already got their wish three months ago.

 But they continued with protests and constantly escalated violence, indicating that those who planned, organized and supported the violent protests must have some ulterior motive at the very beginning.

 The demonstrations that took place in the past were basically staged in a peaceful manner, where the protesters immediately stopped after they made their points.

 This time, however, these radicals don’t seem to give up until they destabilize or even destroy Hong Kong to realize the ultimate goal of putting China in a mess and hindering the progress of the country.

 Under such circumstances, the first priority is still to stop the violence, end the chaos and restore order.

 The situation is already very clear. The current chaos in Hong Kong has nothing to do with human rights, freedom or democracy. It is blatant violence, some of which has gone far beyond the bottom line of human civilization, morality and the rule of law. Meanwhile, human rights are seriously distorted and abused in such violence.

 To stop violence requires Hong Kong police to enforce the law in a professional, effective and solemn way. After all, it is their statutory duty to resort to forceful and appropriate measures to restrain the radicals and defend themselves.

 Hong Kong compatriots have had enough of it. It has become a widely held belief that violence should be stopped and the rule of law and order be restored. It is time that every resident took action to safeguard their homeland and no one should stand aloof.

 The compatriots on the mainland and overseas Chinese, especially the netizens, need to control their emotions and avoid causing further harm to Hong Kong compatriots by acting on impulse.

 Every time China got into trouble in the past, Hong Kong compatriots were always there to support their motherland, which everyone in the country should never forget.

 If Hong Kong gets sick, China will also feel the pains and suffer from the loss. The evil forces deliberately create conflicts between the mainland and Hong Kong and make us turn against each other. Every Chinese must be highly vigilant and not fall into the trap of the enemies.

 The rest of us should sincerely care about Hong Kong compatriots, especially the young generation, effectively helping them solve practical problems. The incident will never shake our love, support and confidence for Hong Kong.

 We should make it clear that China will never give up Hong Kong and will always be the rock of Hong Kong compatriots.

 The rule of law in Hong Kong has encountered unprecedented challenges and been cornered to the verge of destruction. The best way to defend the rule of law is to employ rightful thinking and measures to deal with the disorder in Hong Kong.

 It is necessary to make use of all resources available, including the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China, the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and other laws in Hong Kong, to overcome all the obstacles and difficulties, to resolutely defend the authority of the Constitution and the Basic Law, and to restore order in Hong Kong.

 In addition, we should not exclude any possibilities and prepare for everything that may happen. The country will never shy away from its constitutional responsibility for Hong Kong.

 “One country, two systems” model is not an expedient, but a long-term strategy of the country. The central government has always been sincerely and carefully. The practice of “one country, two systems” for more than 20 years has also been very successful.

 Despite this incident, the central government will continue to unswervingly adopt the “one country, two systems” policy, making sure that its practice remains convincing.

 Of course, the government also needs to find out the deficiencies in the policy and take practical measures to ensure its effective implementation in the future.

 Foreign hostile forces need to stop intervening in Hong Kong affairs, supporting or inciting violence and misleading the young people.

 The Hong Kong violence revealed to Chinese mainlanders the true colors of the human rights, freedom and democracy in the West.

 While the United States and the United Kingdom are increasingly divided from within, Chinese people should remain united under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China that centers around Comrade Xi Jinping so as to win the special war under the current circumstances.

"Chinese people voice firm support for Hong Kong police, government, and chief executive","In the past few weeks, as the protests against the extradition bill in China’s Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) have escalated, turning into a war against peace and law-based governance in Hong Kong, Chinese people from all walks of life have expressed strong support for the Hong Kong police, government, and Chief Executive Carrie Lam.

 “Like Fu Guohao, I, too, support the Hong Kong police.”

 Fu Guohao, a Global Times reporter who was illegally tied up, insulted and brutally beaten by a group of rioters in the Hong Kong International Airport on the evening of Aug. 13, has caused an online storm recently.

 Before being surrounded and attacked by the mob, the young reporter provided the public with first-hand information and reports on the chaos in Hong Kong.

 Besieged and with his hands and legs tied by the black-clad radicals, Fu said to the mob, “I support the Hong Kong police. You can beat me now.” The video clip went viral online, deeply affecting internet users across the country.

 Fu’s remarks quickly became the hottest topic on one of China’s most popular social media platforms, Sina Weibo.

 Then, on Aug. 14, the news “Fu was discharged from hospital” again became one of the most searched phrases on Sina Weibo, together with others including “Fu Guohao is the real man” and “I support the Hong Kong police.”

 On the morning of the same day, the official Weibo account of People’s Daily launched an online campaign “I too support the Hong Kong police,” which was shared more than 5.7 million times within one day.

 The online campaign “Like Fu Guohao, I, too, support the Hong Kong police” initiated by the People’s Daily app on Aug. 14 received 169,000 supporters within 2 hours.

 Meanwhile, pictures of many Hong Kong residents and groups visiting Fu quickly swept social media platforms.

 “We are all flag guardians.”

 On Aug. 3 and Aug. 5, some rioters tore down the Five-Starred Red Flag from flagpoles and threw the flag into the sea, which was widely denounced across China.

 Before dawn on Aug. 4, a dozen people who love China and Hong Kong SAR voluntarily came to the place where rioters tore down the national flag to raise it again. The scene was recorded by Global Times and touched the hearts of netizens.

 An online discussion, “The Five-Starred Red Flag has 1.4 billion flag guardians”, hosted by CCTV news on Weibo, was viewed 5 billion times within a week, among which the post “The Five-Starred Red Flag has 1.4 billion flag guardians. Forward this post. I’m a flag guardian,” published on Aug. 4 was forwarded for more than 10.5 million times.

 Many Hong Kong actors forwarded the post as soon as it was posted. Many people who forwarded the post, including public figures, also added the Five-Starred Red Flag logo after their Weibo names.

 On the evening of Aug. 11, the new media center of People’s Daily organized a public drone show in Shenzhen, south China’s Guangdong Province. Drones changed formation to present different words and pictures, including “I love Shenzhen,” “I love Hong Kong,” and “I love China.” Relevant videos of the magnificent show were forwarded more than 300,000 times and played over 70 million times on Sina Weibo.

 “Stop the violence and end the chaos, return peace and stability to the Hong Kong residents.”

 Since Aug. 12, Hong Kong International Airport, which was once “the best airport in the world,” has been paralyzed due to frequent disturbances and occupation by protesters.

 Various circles in Hong Kong, including airlines and lawyers, voiced condemnation of the riots caused by the radicals.

 On Aug. 13, 40 lawmakers of the pro-establishment camp jointly issued a statement, saying “only by stopping the violence and ending the chaos, can we return peace and stability to the Hong Kong residents.”

 In addition, six major property developers in Hong Kong expressed their support via newspapers for the police to maintain law-based governance and restore the Hong Kong economy as soon as possible.

 On Aug. 13, while meeting the press, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam asked, almost sobbing, “this city, this home, do you have the heart to push it into an abyss, see it smashed to pieces?”

 “This question posed by Chief Executive Carrie Lam breaks our hearts. We feel deeply sorry for Hong Kong. The Pearl of the Orient should not be spoiled like this,” said CCTV news anchor Kang Hui in a short video.

 “We support you, the Hong Kong police, Hong Kong SAR government, Chief Executive Carrie Lam. We are with you,” said Kang."
“Going north”: a HK entrepreneur seeks opportunities in the Chinese mainland,"In late August, the blazing sun dazzles in Shenzhen, south China’s Guangdong province. So too does the passion of Hong Kong youths who chase their dreams here. Calvin Tang, the CEO of Sigma Square Investments and the partner of Hexacubic Consulting, is one of them. On Thursday, the young entrepreneur sat down for an interview with People’s Daily Online, sharing his story of seeking opportunities in the mainland, or in his words, “going north” on his journey.

 In 2010, Calvin came to Shanghai to study for his MBA at the China Europe International Business School and stayed for six years, as the mainland is home to enormous opportunities as well as plenty of new projects. Specializing in private equity investment, Calvin now does business primarily in both Hong Kong and Shenzhen, offering services for mainland enterprises trying to “go global”.

 When asked why he chose Hong Kong and Shenzhen to start business, Calvin mentioned the important role of both cities in the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, noting that the two places boast talents, preferential policies and strategic importance.

 In the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, cities are inter-complementary, said Calvin. “Each city has its own advantages. Hong Kong enjoys distinctive advantages in language, and its access to foreign capital and capital markets. The strengths of Shenzhen are its science & tech development and talents,” Calvin said. “I believe that Shenzhen and Hong Kong will be at the frontline of the overall development of China.”

 “I’ve been ‘going north’ on my journey,” Calvin said.

 Calvin is not the only person from Hong Kong to jump on the investment bandwagon in the mainland. Since China’s reform and opening-up was launched, Hong Kong has been the largest source of overseas investment for the mainland. Meanwhile, Hong Kong has also been a major destination for mainland enterprises looking to ""go global"". Hong Kong, serving as a liaison between the mainland and the rest of the world, not only benefits from the mainland market, but also helps boost the mainland’s foreign trade.

 Over the past decade, Hong Kong has been closely linked with the mainland in various aspects. The recent violent protests in Hong Kong, Calvin noted, have hampered the region’s business in such sectors as tourism and retail, adding that the pursuit of peace is the common aspiration of Hong Kong residents.

 “I believe that the violence is being actioned by a small number of ill-intentioned people, but this situation won’t last long. We need to have faith in our administrators, law enforcement officials and our legal system. All words and actions have consequences,” said Calvin.

 Looking forward, Calvin will continue life in the two neighboring cities. “As my specialty is finance, I will concentrate on this area in my career development, and will continue to work in both Hong Kong and the mainland, helping more companies of our country to invest and raise funds,” Calvin said.

 In his eyes, Hong Kong youths must seize the opportunities offered by the nation. “The first step is to get know more about the mainland, to understand its culture, history and upcoming policies and development. Second, we have to believe that we are able to contribute ourselves to the progress of our country,” he said.

 “The future belongs to the youth, and China will undoubtedly be stronger in the future,” said Calvin."
Op-Ed: What a shame for US to interfere in HK affairs in the disguise of democracy,"On Sunday, protesters waving American flags marched to the US Consulate in Hong Kong, calling on Washington to pass a bill aimed at backing Hong Kong protesters. In response, the Hong Kong SAR government expressed regret over the reintroduction of the act and reiterated that foreign legislatures should stay out of its internal affairs. The US bill is a dirty trick to up the pressure on China and push an agenda, a type of “color revolution.”

 The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, a bill cosponsored by US senators Marco Rubio, Ben Cardin, Jim Risch, and Bob Menendez, aims to reaffirm US commitment to democracy promotion in Hong Kong. In a press release, the US senators cited “Chinese interference” in Hong Kong’s affairs as a reason for the bill. They also criticized the SAR government for trying to halt the violence and chaos and applauded the protesters for their actions.

 Whichever way you slice it, the US bill is blunt interference in Hong Kong’s internal affairs, which are China’s internal affairs, and further proof that certain US politicians see the problem in Hong Kong as an opportunity to fan the flames of unrest in Hong Kong. The bill is also a blunt attempt to destabilize China.

 It is something the world has seen repeatedly: interfere in the politics of other countries under the guise of democracy promotion. The promotion of Western-style democracy is a core principle of US foreign policy, the goal of which is to make the world more like America and turn certain countries and regions into vassals of the United States. This has weaponized democracy promotion by making it a tool to undermine adversaries, and US politicians with an anti-China agenda are no doubt eager to use the radical protesters as pawns for this goal.

 The demonstrations that began months ago in Hong Kong after the SAR government introduced the now-scrapped extradition bill have gone far beyond the point of peaceful demonstrations. So far, in fact, that it is now pointless to describe them as such. From throwing bricks, petrol bombs, and other objects at government buildings and targeting police with offensive weapons to disrupting air travel and setting subway stations on fire, the protests have been getting more violent and extreme.

 It is a shame that certain US senators see Hong Kong as a Cold War battleground. They would rather see radical protesters burn Hong Kong to the ground if it furthers their agenda than let the SAR government find a suitable solution for its problem. No country ruled by law would tolerate radical and violent protests, let alone the rise of a separatist movement. Yet, certain US politicians are throwing their support behind and even encouraging the unrest in Hong Kong—all in the name of democracy.

 The problem in Hong Kong is an internal affair of China. US senators should stop trying to influence the outcome in Hong Kong. Their efforts to fan the flames of rebellion make it hard not to conclude that at least part of what is happening in Hong Kong is a kind of “color revolution.”

 Lastly, the US bill will not help Hong Kong and it is a fantasy to think that it will. For those who are begging for US interference, they should abandon their illusions about American-style democracy and not place illusory faith in the hands of those who want to weaken China."
What a shame Liu Yifei is being attacked for her support for Hong Kong police,"Chinese-American actress Liu Yifei, who plays Mulan in Disney’s upcoming live-action remake of Mulan, is under attack for expressing her support for police in Hong Kong, who have struggled to maintain public order after violent protests broke out in the city.

 On her personal Weibo account, the popular actress reposted and commented on a People’s Daily post which shamed the rioters in Hong Kong for their extreme violence. The post says in English, “What a shame for Hong Kong” and includes the now-viral quote by a Global Times reporter who was tied up and beaten by radical protestors at Hong Kong’s airport: “I support the Hong Kong police. You can beat me up now.”

 The original post has received roughly 2.8 million likes and has been reposted close to 7.8 million times as of press time. In her post, the actress included the popular hashtag: “I also support the Hong Kong police.” And her voice is not alone. It adds to the growing list of posts by other Chinese celebrities who have spoken out against the violence in Hong Kong.

 Internationally, however, the actress was slammed for supporting Hong Kong police. The post was translated into English and then reposted with the tag #BoycottDisney, with many calling for Disney to drop her and for movie-goers to boycott the remake.

 It is a shame that the Chinese-American actress is being attacked for supporting Hong Kong police. As native of China, Liu Yifei is obviously concerned about the violence and chaos in the city and she has the right to voice her opinion on it. She is also in a better position to comment on the situation than people who have it out for China.

 But the Western media has largely framed the Hong Kong police response in a negative light while downplaying the increasingly violent acts that have triggered it and in some cases praising or at least encouraging the violence.

 The #BoycottDisney hashtag reveals the bias against China and shows that some people are just looking for any excuse to attack China. Millions of Chinese people have expressed support for Hong Kong police because they want to see law and order be restored in Hong Kong and it is wrong to equate that support with support for brutality and oppression.

 In fact, some have even gone so far as to accuse her of spitting in the face of democracy. However, it is those who are attacking her for her opinion and support who are the real enemies of democracy. The vicious attack on Liu Yifei and the mindless call to boycott the Mulan remake is nothing short of an attempt to silence certain voices and to drag Hong Kong into an abyss.

 The backlash against Liu Yifei puts on display the hypocrisy of their criticism. Hong Kong has been rocked by increasingly violent protests for months, which has prompted the police to respond on an almost daily basis. The demonstrations have gone far beyond the scope of peaceful demonstrations and have devolved into extreme violence. It cannot be left unchecked.

 Some have accused the Hong Kong police of brutality and support for the police has been equated with support for police brutality, but you would never see this amount of restraint on the streets of the United States for instance. In 2014, after riots broke out in Ferguson, Missouri, police responded like an invading army.

 What a shame Liu Yifei is being attacked for simply expressing her opinion and support. We should try to better understand the situation in Hong Kong and not be so quick to attack China."
"Feature: From transportation to exchange, new mission for high-speed railway in Hong Kong","HONG KONG, Sept. 23 -- Lee Chun-yin felt that his work became much easier compared with one year ago.

 Working in the training industry, the 52-year-old man in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region needs to make three to five trips a month to the mainland. ""Thanks to the express train, my travel time is shortened and the journey is more comfortable,"" he said.

 He was referring to the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link (XRL), the Hong Kong section of which opened on Sept. 23 last year, linking Hong Kong directly to dozens of destinations in the mainland.

 Monday marks the one year anniversary of the Hong Kong session's opening to public.

 Before XRL was in operation, Lee had to take metro before changing to the bus. ""When I arrived at the port, I had to carry my luggage back and forth,"" he recalled. ""With the high-speed train, however, I was saved from all the troubles. And it is very fast.""

 A trip from Hong Kong to Xiamen in east China's Fujian province only takes four and a half hours, while in the past it would cost him six or seven hours. The travel time to Beijing, which used to exceed 24 hours, is about nine hours now.

 ""People in Hong Kong have become used to and fond of the new way of travelling to the mainland,"" said Cheris Lee, chief of operating-high speed rail and intercity of MTR corporation.

 China is home to some 29,000 km of high-speed railways, accounting for more than two thirds of the world's total.

 ""In Hong Kong, although high-speed trains only run a stretch of 26 kilometers, it is a milestone that we could be connected with the mainland,"" said Cheris Lee. ""People here do not have to transfer in Shenzhen or Guangzhou before reaching other cities.""

 She told Xinhua that XRL sees about 45,000 passengers a day on the weekdays, while at the weekends the number stands at 62,000. On special occasions such as the Spring Festival it could carry as many as 100,000 passengers on the busiest day.

 At the railway station on Monday, a man surnamed Cheng was using the machine to buy tickets to Xiamen. After he retired, the 65-year-old man liked travelling in the mainland.

 ""The airports are mostly located on the outskirts, and you need to get there two hours before boarding,"" he said. ""The XRL is more convenient, which takes you directly to the city center.""

 A man surnamed Ge who lives in Shenzhen and comes to Hong Kong every Saturday for MBA studies, said ""it is our consensus with the Hong Kong students that XRL benefit all of us, so that we could have more exchanges. Hopefully this could help Hong Kong and the mainland get to know each other better.""

 Due to the continued violent protests in Hong Kong, the railway station is apparently less busy than before.

 The passengers Xinhua interviewed shared the view that hopefully peace could be restored soon.

 ""With the XRL, I hope that people from both sides could visit each other more frequently, so as to eliminate misunderstanding,"" said Lee Chun-yin's companion."
PLA Hong Kong garrison not 'strawmen'; Central govt could interfere: official,"The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Garrison in Hong Kong is not a ""strawman,"" but could step in to contain the violent unrest in the Chinese city when necessary to protect the country's ""one country, two systems"" principle in Hong Kong, an official at China's top legislature said on Saturday.

 At a seminar to commemorate the 115th anniversary of the birthday of late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, senior officials and top experts said that further violence and chaos in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) could not only jeopardize the city's future but also the country's sovereignty, and that the central government might step in if necessary.

 ""The soldiers stationed in Hong Kong are not strawmen meant to just stay in the garrison, they are an important part of the 'one country, two systems,'"" Maria Tam Wai-chu, deputy director of the Hong Kong SAR Basic Law Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said at the seminar in Shenzhen, South China's Guangdong Province.

 If unrest takes place in Hong Kong, the central government ""of course"" can step in to restore order and peace and ensure the proper functioning of ""one country, two systems,"" according to Tam.

 Weeks of violence and chaos have persisted in the special administrative region, with some secessionist forces backed by foreign power constantly challenging the model that ensures Hong Kong's high-degree of autonomy as well as the country's sovereignty.

 At the seminar, Xu Ze, president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong &Macao Studies, said that the persistent violent activities in Hong Kong have undermined Hong Kong's interests and will threaten China's national interests, and if they continue, ""Hong Kong could face the risk of sinking.""

 Lau Siu-kai, vice president of the association added that the situation in Hong Kong is a ""final battle"" between ""China and foreign and domestic anti-Beijing forces led by the US,"" because what the radical elements demand is to ""seize the power"" from the central government and the Hong Kong SAR government.

 Such intentions and violent actions could lead to ""unbearable loss"" for Hong Kong, according to

 Wang Zhenmin, former director of the Legal Affairs Department of the central government's liaison office in Hong Kong.

 ""If the 'one country, two systems' does not exist anymore, it will be a huge loss for [China] but will be bearable because all it needs to do is to implement 'one country, one system' in Hong Kong; however, that will be a disaster for Hong Kong and a complete loss that is unbearable,"" Wang said if street violence continues, that scenario is ""completely predictable. Is that what some of these people want?""

 However, Wang also ensured that the central government will not leave Hong Kong behind because of the current situation. ""We are confident about Hong Kong and sufficiently patient with Hong Kong's youth for their reckoning. But, for those who are behind the turmoil and who poisoned our youth, the country will not let them go easily. They will pay a heavy price,"" he said.

 HK chief executive urges protesters to 'sit down and talk' amid ongoing protests

 HK rioters turn protests into violence again on 12th straight weekend"
Greek man condemns western reports on Hong Kong as ‘fake news’,"A Greek man recently condemned western media for fake reports relating to the recent Hong Kong protests and urged young demonstrators to stop violence in an interview with China Central Television (CCTV).

 A short video of Peter condemning a group of Hong Kong protesters in Australia went viral on Chinese social media, and caught the attention of Xinwen Linabo, CCTV’s prime-time evening news program.

 The video was filmed in Adelaide, and shows the Greek passer-by yelling at the demonstrators, “you think this is going to save Hong Kong? This is ruining Hong Kong. This is wrong.”

 Peter told CCTV that demonstrators would be jailed if the violent demonstrations took place in Australia.

 In his view, the western media often tells lies and creates fake news to oppose China.

 ""The Western media always use fake news. They are always anti-China. If they don't like something, they will use anything to convince the people that the other side is wrong,"" he said.

 Now, Peter has become popular among Chinese netizens as well as locals in Adelaide. Some passers-by come up to give him a hug or take a photo with him.

 Besides Peter, several other foreigners have expressed their opinions toward the ongoing Hong Kong protests.

 On Aug. 12, a stranded Australian passenger countered the demonstrators at the Hong Kong International Airport, condemning them for throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails at the police and noting that the Hong Kong police were quite restrained.

 Mentioning the July 1 incident of protesters besieging the Legislature Council, Peter Bently, a Hong Kong permanent resident of British origin, said that the riot police in western countries such as the UK, the US or France would use real bullets not rubber bullets facing the extreme radicals."
Expanding violence shows dangers of copying HK,"Double standards undermine rule of law, haunt Western society: expert

 Chile witnessed the worst unrest in decades over the weekend where people protested against the high cost of living. The Chilean government responded by declaring a state of emergency and imposing a night curfew.

 In Santiago, hundreds of troops were deployed on the streets as protesters erected barricades and set buses on fire. Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse them. More than 300 people were arrested, and 156 police injured, as were 11 civilians, BBC reported. Three people were killed in fire on Sunday in a ransacked supermarket of Santiago during the riot, AFP reported.

 Riots also occurred in other cities over the weekend. After a massive protest on Friday, radical protesters in Barcelona turned the city center into war zones in a fifth consecutive night of violence.

 Occupying airports, setting fires and provoking police: Such tactics are common in recent protests, with massive violent protests going on simultaneously in Barcelona, Santiago and Hong Kong.

 The West is to be blamed for expanding violence as riots have been condoned in Hong Kong for months by certain Western elites, Chinese experts said.

 Similar protest tactics

 Around 7 pm Friday in Barcelona, mask-wearing radicals gathered around places including Gran Via, outside a police headquarters, and Urquinaona square, Catalonia Square, chanting slogans like ""Free political prisoners"" ""Independence, liberty,"" according to video footages available online. Youngsters also verbally assaulted the police officers, who have become a major target amid recent clashes. When violence escalated, almost all the shops and stores nearby were shut down.

 Radical protesters in Barcelona and in Hong Kong share some similar tactics like covering their faces when conducting illegal activities, arson at major traffic junctions and targeting police officers.

 However, when police began dispersal work in Barcelona, nearly no reporter would stand between the police and rioters, as the police would arrest those who obstructed their way during the dispersal. But in Hong Kong, crowds of reporters often stand between rioters and police officers and obstruct officers on duty using their arms or cameras.

 In contrast with Hong Kong police's restraint in law enforcement, police in Barcelona acted in a fast and decisive manner.

 In Western media reports, Hong Kong radical protesters conduct violence for a reason, as they claimed that peaceful protests would not lead to any result. And such a way of illustrating violent protests at the global stage surely inspired other young radicals in different countries, Zhang Yiwu, Peking University professor, told the Global Times.

 ""Such violent scenes successfully attracted the attention of Western media, which has become a major way to sustain the movement,"" he said.

 Western media, which still has major influence in public discourse, has been playing a negative role of reporting Hong Kong social unrest, and their own bias inspired more radicals in Barcelona and Santiago, who consider peaceful protests useless, and they would reach their goals by ignoring rule of law, he said. ""The West will swallow such bitterness,"" Zhang said.

 Pan Deng, executive director of the Ibero-America Law Center of China University of Political Science and Law, believes that the ideology-driven Western media has played a role in manipulating public opinion.

 Pan noted that the chaos in places like Hong Kong, Moscow and Caracas has the typical nature of a ""color revolution."" The Western media and certain Western political forces will push forward the unstable situation in these places.

 But Western media downplay similar situations in Spain, a Western country. In the past few days, mass protests also affected London city center.

 Robert Manning, a senior fellow at the Brent Scowcroft Center for International Security at the Atlantic Council, said that the social unrest can be attributed to populism. ""Populist activism has been on the rise in the US and Europe for several years. In the case of Catalan separatists, they have been in near state of war with Madrid for decades,"" Manning told the Global Times.

 Western values clash

 On Friday night, the streets of Barcelona became a total mess. Stones, broken glass and bricks were scattered at almost every junction. Around 10 pm, police began dispersal around the Plaza de Catalunya, firing tear gas, smoke grenades and rubber bullets.

 Protesters in Catalonia, like those in Hong Kong, adopt the so-called ""Be Water"" tactics, which are flexible, fluid and fast-moving during clashes with the police. When police came to disperse the crowd, rioters fled quickly into different streets around the plaza, increasing difficulties for police to arrest them.

 Many protesters are students, who called for a referendum for independence and hoped that they could make a difference.

 ""When we vote, we want to vote in our own way,"" said Naia, a 15-year-old student who protested on the streets near the Catalonia Square.

 Some youngsters said they know what happened in Hong Kong, and they saw some similarities in the way they fight. However, others said they don't really know where the movement is leading them. ""I don't really think we'll achieve something, although I hope so,"" Naia said.

 Hong Kong secessionist like Denise Ho praised the protests in Catalonia and told young radicals to ""believe in your every action.""

 ""The values and democratic models the West endorses are used to destabilize rival countries, while what is happening now in Catalonia now proves otherwise - such values are inciting locals, especially vulnerable people, and causing disturbance,"" Pan told the Global Times."
Ongoing violence could strike irreparable blow to Hong Kong economy: expert,"BAKU, Aug. 27 -- The ongoing violence in Hong Kong could deal an irreparable blow to the city's economic performance, an Azerbaijani expert warned on Tuesday.

 Political analyst Ilgar Velizade told Xinhua the Chinese port city has long benefited from the ""one country, two systems"" principle, and continuously functions as a gateway for overseas investors and exporters to China.

 This role has put Hong Kong at the top of economy and finance ratings for years, Velizade said, warning that this achievement could be ruined by the ongoing turmoil.

 Destructive acts by rioters, the ongoing protests, and the threat of chaos, unrest and illegal activities that have almost paralyzed the city could trigger an outflow of investment, even an economic recession, which will profoundly impact the lives of ordinary people, the expert said.

 He said that China's numerous friends around the world, including those in Azerbaijan, hope for the restoration of peace and stability as soon as possible in Hong Kong."
"Love Hong Kong and stop hurting it, say ordinary Hong Kong people","HONG KONG, Aug. 19 (Xinhua) -- As protracted violence continue to roil Hong Kong, ordinary Hong Kong people find themselves bearing the brunt of the burden. Concerned about the future of their life and that of their home, more and more are speaking out against violence.

 For a hotel room attendant surnamed Wang, the protracted violence could cost her job as a usual summer boom for Hong Kong's tourism industry has turned into a chilly winter due to the unrest.

 ""Because of a significant falloff in bookings, the hotel asked staff to take leave as soon as possible,"" Wang told Xinhua, adding that if the situation fails to improve after the leave, she will have to take unpaid leave.

 Wang said her husband is a taxi driver, and his business has fallen by half since June, when Hong Kong's opposition and some radical forces started to use the pretext of peaceful demonstration to engage in violent protests.

 ""If I take unpaid leave, my family's earnings will drop to quarter of what it used to be,"" she said.

 Currently more than 20 countries and regions have issued travel advisories for Hong Kong over the unrest.

 In the June-July period, average earnings for tourism workers plunged by 74 percent, while the number of tours in Hong Kong fell 74 percent on average, according to a survey by the Hong Kong Tour Guides General Union.

 The weeks-long violent protests have also taken a toll on small businesses like Wong Pang's logistics company.

 As protests dragged on into August, black-clad demonstrators held unlawful assemblies at the Hong Kong International Airport, bringing the region's major transport hub to a grinding halt. The siege of the airport had cost his company a six-figure loss, said Wong.

 ""By blocking the airport, the subway and the tunnels and calling for strikes, they (violent protesters) seek to disrupt Hong Kong's transport and economy in their own interests,"" said Wong.

 ""They may claim that they love Hong Kong, but all I can see is their despicable aim to disrupt the economy and hijack the interests of the majority of Hong Kong people,"" he added.

 For a Hong Kong resident surnamed Ng, living near a police station used to mean a sense of security. But as radical protesters besiege police stations and attack police officers across Hong Kong, vicinity has incurred suffering.

 For days, Ng said, protesters had gathered around the police station till wee hours, throwing bricks at officers and firing laser beams at them.

 ""I haven't had a sound sleep for days. I hope those protesters will understand that they are dragging down all Hong Kong people with them,"" said Ng. ""But all we need is to live and work peacefully.""

 The protests have also sown divisions in the Hong Kong society, pitting friends and family members against each other, said Jackie Cheung, vice president of Federation of Hong Kong Shenzhen Associations.

 ""Families are divided, with parents and children being unable to communicate with each other. Hong Kong is no longer peaceful,"" Cheung said.

 Amid the threats, more and more Hong Kong people are speaking out against violence.

 Despite rains, over 470,000 people gathered on Saturday in a rally held at Tamar Park in Hong Kong to voice their demand for peace and stability.

 Calling Hong Kong ""always a peaceful society,"" a 57-year-old gardener surnamed Chan expressed his hope that ""the extremist radicals stop violent acts so that people can return to peaceful life.""

 A bank staff surnamed Fu said Hong Kong is becoming more and more alien to him nowadays, with many famous tourist sites being painted with aggressive slogans and residents staying at home on weekends out of safety concerns.

 ""We all love Hong Kong, but I am very sad to see what happened recently,"" said Fu.

 ""Resorting to force is never an option. It will not help,"" he added. ""I hope the demonstrators would return to reason, put aside violence and bring back a vibrant, peaceful Hong Kong."""
Hong Kong's business activity sees steepest fall since 2008 financial crisis: IHS Markit,"HONG KONG, Sept. 4 (Xinhua) -- Decline of business activities in Hong Kong accelerated in August to near-record levels as protests continue to dampen demand, London-based consulting firm IHS Markit reported Wednesday.

 Hong Kong's Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) sank to 40.8 in August, down from 43.8 in July, signaling the steepest deterioration in the health of the private sector since February 2009, according to IHS Markit's PMI survey.

 The only other time that the PMI survey has recorded a steeper downturn was during the SARS epidemic in 2003 and the global financial crisis in 2008, said Bernard Aw, principal economist at IHS Markit.

 PMI is a composite single-figure indicator of economic performance derived from indicators for new orders, output, employment, suppliers' delivery times and stocks of purchases. Figures greater than 50 indicate overall improvement of the economy.

 Almost all aspects surveyed for the PMI indicator were worsening in Hong Kong with widespread pessimism and record-low business confidence, according to the report.

 ""The latest PMI data reveal a Hong Kong economy flirting with recession in the third quarter as business activity is increasingly aggravated by protest-related paralysis,"" Bernard Aw added. Enditem"
Commentary: Washington's phony concern brings real hate to Hong Kong streets,"BEIJING, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of Representatives passed on Tuesday the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019, moving it a step closer to becoming a law.

 The bill would mandate an annual review to assess whether the Chinese city has sufficient autonomy, another classic example of how Washington uses its domestic laws to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.

 Immediately following the passage, China expressed strong indignation and its firm opposition. What Hong Kong faces at present are not so-called issues of human rights and democracy, but the need to end violence and chaos, restore order and uphold the rule of law as soon as possible, said a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson.

 By turning a blind eye to the violence in Hong Kong, U.S. lawmakers like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Senator Ted Cruz fail to see how radical demonstrators have attacked the values they so much cherish.

 Under the pretext of protecting so-called human rights and freedom in Hong Kong, these opportunist lawmakers are simply trying to score cheap political points by making getting-tough-on-China headlines.

 Moreover, the phony support these U.S. lawmakers claim to have for Hong Kong is very likely to spread hate and bring more violence to the streets of the city.

 That violence in Hong Kong boasts an American cheerleader, which was evident when a group of U.S. lawmakers received activists in Washington last month while protesters in Hong Kong waved U.S. national flags. In months after the U.S. bill was introduced in June, the protests turned uglier, with rioters setting fire, vandalizing public facilities, and attacking police and local residents.

 Violence and instability have already begun to erode what props Hong Kong as a safe metropolis and global financial hub. Should the bill become law, it would further excite violent protesters to take to the streets, sabotaging efforts in recent months by the Hong Kong government to reclaim stability and prosperity.

 Hong Kong affairs are China's internal affairs. Playing Hong Kong as a card will get the United States nowhere. Should the act eventually become law, it will not only harm China's interests and China-U.S. ties, but also severely undermine the interests of the U.S. firms that depend on the city's social tranquility and economic vitality.

 These self-serving U.S. politicians and treacherous attempts to roil Hong Kong will fail on all fronts. The U.S. should quit meddling in China's internal affairs to allow peace and prosperity to reign supreme once again in Hong Kong."
Commentary: How much has the U.S. offered to Hong Kong rioters?,"Over past weeks, repeated attacks by violent radicals in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) have caused law-based governance and freedom, the two things cherished the most by Hong Kong citizens, to be trampled on the ground.

 Anti-China forces in the U.S. have not only openly cheered the violent protesters on and made irresponsible remarks about the riots, but provided money, benefits, and advice to the rioters.

 According to Ta Kung Pao, one of the most important newspapers in Hong Kong, Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor, a non-governmental organization (NGO) which played a vanguard role in the protests against amendments to Hong Kong's extradition law, has received funds from the U.S. National Endowment for Democracy (NED) since 1995, amounting to a total of more than 15 million HK dollars (around $1.9 million).

 From 1995 to the beginning of 2015, NED, through its subordinate body, provided $3.95 million to opposition organizations in Hong Kong, as shown by a report from Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong-based Chinese language newspaper.

 In addition, data released by NED in 2018 revealed that of all the countries that NED allocated funds to, China topped the list at $6.5 million.

 These figures are just the tip of the iceberg, as it's believed that most NED spending was not disclosed due to its ""sensitivity"".

 While calling itself an NGO, NED played the role of a backstage manipulator in multiple color revolutions and has an inextricable connection with the U.S. Congress as well as intelligence agencies.

 Looking back to the demonstrations in Hong Kong in recent years, it's not hard to find NED's inglorious role in these incidents. For instance, representatives of the opposition organizations of Hong Kong, including Martin Lee Chu-ming and Nathan Law Kwun-chung, went to the U.S. this May to attend and deliver speeches at a forum held by NED, imploring NED to interfere in the proposed amendments to Hong Kong's extradition law.

 During the forum, an executive of NED Asian program said to Nathan Law Kwun-chung that from 2014 to 2017, he asked Law the same questions every year: What can we do for you? How can we help you?

 As they expected, disturbances in Hong Kong escalated, and demonstrations were turned into violent riots and became increasingly fierce.

 Ironically, when riots in Hong Kong were in full swing, Nathan Law Kwun-chung flew to the U.S. to begin his college life at Yale University. Some internet users commented that ""he went to his U.S. masters to claim his reward.""

 According to WikiLeaks, Jimmy Lai Chee-ying, chairman of Hong Kong-based media Next Digital Ltd., is a super funder of opposition organizations in Hong Kong and the middleman between the U.S. and some forces in Hong Kong. Lai spent both money and efforts to fuel the recent protests in Hong Kong, taking a leading position in the disturbances.

 As an article published on the website of German newspaper Handelsblatt pointed out, while urging Hong Kong and Beijing to exercise restraint, the U.S. itself was fanning the flames of the confrontation with advice, action and money.

 Former U.S. President Abraham Lincoln once said, ""You can fool all the people some of the time, some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all of the time."" Following the clues of monetary aid to opposition organizations in Hong Kong, it's easy to see the conspiracy to turn Hong Kong into chaos in the interests of certain parties.

 The recent riots in Hong Kong are a product of the U.S., which spent substantial resources and efforts to manipulate Hong Kong.

 All in all, the backstage manipulator wants to turn Hong Kong into trouble for China, to contain or stifle China's development.

 It must be clear that Hong Kong is part of China. The Chinese government will never allow any external forces to interfere in Hong Kong affairs, let alone turn the city into a mess.

 The U.S. had better stop such tricks, obey international law and the basic norms of international relations, make a clean break with the rioters, stop sending obverse signals to radicals, and pull back before it is too late."
Using children as bargaining chips a conscienceless move of HK protesters,"During the Tsuen Wan and Kwai Tsing march in Hong Kong on Aug. 25, the police arrested 36 demonstrators who repeatedly broke through the police cordon, including a 12-year-old boy who wore a mask and carried a 5-foot-long iron bar.

 The next day, Li Chi-Lam, principal of Lingnan Hang Yee Memorial Secondary School, confirmed on social media that a student of the school was arrested on Aug. 25.

 The news that a child was involved in an illegal gathering and even acted as a pioneer of violence put Hong Kong society into a state of shock.

 In fact, several high school gatherings have taken place in illegal and violent activities in Hong Kong that evolved from the anti-extradition bill protests.

 The children have been used as political bargaining chips and tempted into becoming pioneers of violence by some despicable people with ulterior motives, many Hong Kong citizens have said.

 Those behind the scenes wish to incite more violence to destabilize Hong Kong and oppose China. To achieve their evil intentions, they don't care about the future of children at all.

 While deceiving children into causing chaos on the streets, the protesters haven't allowed their own children to do such things.

 Benny Tai Yiu-ting, one of the leaders of the Occupy Central movement that happened in Hong Kong in 2014 where protesters staged a mass sit-in to blockade Central District, for what they considered genuine universal suffrage, publicly stated that his whole family would participate in the campaign, except for his children under 18.

 The same is true for the ongoing demonstrations in Hong Kong, as none of the children of head protesters marched on the streets, exposing the hypocrisy of the provokers.

 Parents must tell right from wrong, see through the vicious intentions of the protesters, and protect their children from being deceived."
Netizens furious over rioters' assault of mainland passenger at HK airport,"A man from the Chinese mainland was beaten up by a crowd of rioters and radical protesters at the Hong Kong airport on Tuesday night, and the protesters claimed the reason for the attack was because they believed he was a ""mainland policeman pretending to be a protester.""

 Observers and mainland netizens were angered by what they called the ruthless and crazy behavior and criticized the airport for failing to manage the situation and ensure the safety of passengers in the terminal building.

 Videos and pictures circulating online showed that rioters kicked and punched the young male traveler. The victim was handcuffed and dragged through the airport by the rioters with a sign on his back that read ""I am a mainland police officer. I am here to sabotage the protest.""

 The Global Times has learned that at around 7pm Tuesday, a large group of protesters surrounded the traveler and searched his wallet for ID. After searching his name online, they found that his name happens to be the same as an auxiliary police officer in Shenzhen.

 Without confirming his identity or the purpose of his travel to Hong Kong, the rioters began assaulting him by cuffing his hands behind his back, splashing water on his head and pointing laser beams into his face. He was denied medical help for hours until being rescued at around 10:40pm by Hong Kong police.

 According to police, a passenger at Hong Kong airport was set upon by ""protesters"" and needed medical treatment, but the protesters did not allow ambulancemen to take him to hospital.

 Hong Kong police received a request for assistance from the airport and when they arrived, they instructed the protesters not to prevent the injured passenger from getting medical treatment.

 The police stressed that this was not a site-clearing operation, and the mission was to allow the passenger to be taken to hospital.

 ""Everyone has the right to personal liberty and personal security, which are the most basic human rights. Rioters who encircled and attacked the passenger in the Hong Kong International Airport, violated human rights and the rule of law, no matter who the passenger actually was,"" Albert Wu, a practicing barrister in Hong Kong, told the Global Times.

 These violent protesters and rioters should be arrested and prosecuted as soon as possible, so as to safeguard law and discipline and protect the basic human rights of people in Hong Kong, Wu said. ""As long as they are people, they cannot be treated like that.""

 ""Rioters in Hong Kong are targeting mainland tourists and passengers as a way of venting their frustrations. They were mad and crazy and were carried away by violence. No matter what their motivations were, the act of violence is unacceptable,"" Li Xiaobing, expert on Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, from Nankai University in Tianjin, told the Global Times on Tuesday night.

 Observers and mainland netizens are angry and criticized the airport's administration for doing nothing to stop the violence. ""Is the airport supporting the violence against mainland passengers as well?"" said a netizen on Sina Weibo.

 Zhi Zhenfeng, a legal expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday that Hong Kong airport has failed to implement effective measures to cope with the rioters and showed little will to do so. He said the airport could have shut off the air conditioning, water supply or cut off the power, but in the end chose not to respond to violent acts.

 ""Isn't this indirect support of the rioters?"" Zhi noted.

 He urged Hongkongers who wish to maintain the rule of law to make their voices heard or otherwise they will be held historically accountable for the fall of the city."
HKSAR justice secretary says due consideration given to human rights in devising anti-mask regulation,"HONG KONG, Oct. 13 (Xinhua) -- The secretary for justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government stressed on Sunday that the anti-mask regulation will help reduce act of violence and in devising the new regulation the HKSAR government has given due consideration to human rights guarantees.

 In a blog article published on the website of the HKSAR government's Department of Justice, Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng said that in devising the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation, the government has given due consideration to the human rights guarantees in the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, including the rights on the freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and privacy.

 ""However, these rights are not absolute, and may be subject to restrictions that satisfy the proportionality test including whether a reasonable balance has been struck between the societal benefits of the encroachment and the inroads made into the constitutionally protected rights of the individual,"" she pointed out.

 The new measure would not deprive the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly as people are still free to participate in lawful and peaceful public order events without face covering. If a member of the public in a public place is asked by police officers to remove the face covering to verify his identity, he may wear it again after the verification process is completed, said Cheng.

 ""Interference with a person's rights is minimal, and in any event proportionate to the legitimate aim of protecting public safety and public order,"" she said.

 Other than the specified circumstances set out in the new regulation, people are generally free to wear face masks and the impact on their daily lives is limited, she added.

 The secretary for justice also clarified that in enacting the anti-mask regulation, there is no issue of the Legislative Council being circumvented. ""The new regulation, which is a piece of subsidiary legislation, is made pursuant to the Emergency Regulations Ordinance and has to be laid on the table of the Legislative Council which may by resolution amend the regulation,"" she said.

 Cheng pointed out that prohibiting persons from using face covering would facilitate police investigation and administration of justice and would as well deter them from acting in an unlawful manner on the basis that they may act with impunity by concealing their identity.

 ""The protests and confrontations have continued for almost four months. We hope that the new measure could help curb the spread of violence and restore social order. We also urge the understanding and support of the public in our work,"" she said."
Central government closely following HK situation: spokesperson,"BEIJING, July 29 -- The central government has been closely following the development of the situation in Hong Kong, a spokesperson said.

 Yang Guang, spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks on the recent protests and violent incidents in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, at a press conference held in Beijing on Monday."
"Commissioner's office of Chinese foreign ministry in HK criticizes foreign media's ""irresponsible"" comments","HONG KONG, Aug. 16 -- The Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) has criticized certain foreign media's irresponsible comments on the situation in Hong Kong as ""full of ignorance, prejudice and arrogance.""

 In a statement published on its website late Thursday, the commissioner's office said its spokesperson lodged stern representations with the Wall Street Journal immediately after the newspaper published an editorial on Thursday, expressing strong disapproval and firm opposition.

 The spokesperson said the editorial, titled ""The Hong Kong Stakes for Trump"", distorts the truth and arbitrarily comments on the Hong Kong situation.

 ""Such irresponsible remarks are full of ignorance, prejudice and arrogance,"" the spokesperson pointed out.

 ""Hong Kong is an inalienable part of China, and its affairs are completely China's internal affairs which allow no foreign intervention. The editorial, however, talks about a possible 'invasion of Hong Kong' by China which 'would violate China's treaty with Britain'. Isn't that typical ignorance?""

 ""It also alleges that the SAR government is 'the real provocateur', accuses the police dedicated to enforcing the law and maintaining the order for 'brutality', and whitewashes the rioters by claiming they have 'reasonable' worries and are part of 'peaceful protests'. Isn't that typical prejudice?""

 ""Moreover, it puts on an air of a global policeman, petitions to US policymakers and even urges US president to meddle with Hong Kong affairs with 'blunt candor'. What an epitome of arrogance!""

 The spokesperson emphasized that the truth can never be overshadowed by ignorance, prejudice and arrogance, and the public will not be easily fooled.

 ""We urge the relevant media to immediately correct its mistakes, cover Hong Kong in an objective, impartial, balanced and responsible manner, and make constructive efforts to facilitate understanding of Hong Kong and maintain the city's rule of law, prosperity and stability,"" the spokesperson said."
China responds to U.S. remarks on Hong Kong: FM spokesperson,"China on Friday responded to U.S. President Donald Trump's remarks concerning the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).

 According to reports, the U.S. President tweeted Thursday that a meeting between Chinese leader and Hong Kong's protesters could lead to a happy ending of the protests.

 When asked for comments on this, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said that China has noticed Trump used to say that ""the riots"" in Hong Kong had lasted for a long time.

 ""Violent criminal activities in Hong Kong have escalated continuously since June,"" Hua said, noting such activities ruthlessly trampled on the rule of law and social order, seriously undermined Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, and openly challenged the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle.

 The spokesperson said the most urgent and overriding task at present is to stop the violence and restore order in accordance with the law.

 ""The central government firmly supports Chief Executive Carrie Lam in leading the SAR government to administer the SAR in accordance with the law, and the Hong Kong police in strictly enforcing the law,"" she said, adding the central government also firmly supports the punishment of violent criminals in accordance with the law."
The real democracy for Hong Kong is the one that suits it,"It’s impossible to evaluate a political system without considering social and political conditions. Whether the “shoe” of democracy fits or not, only the wearer himself knows. This could offer some enlightenment for today’s Hong Kong.

 Since the anti-extradition bill protests took place in Hong Kong, the opposition and radical forces raised “five demands”, and the ultimate one is the implementation of “dual universal suffrage”.

 But in fact, what they want is not a stable democracy, but a radical democracy, not a democracy that benefits Hong Kong, but a democracy that is self-interested, and not a democracy for an administrative region under the People’s Republic of China, but a democracy for an independent political entity.

 As a matter of fact, the opposition and radical forces prefer a universal suffrage system exceeding the limits of the Basic Law and the relevant decisions of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. The system could help them select a Chief Executive representing their position and, at the same time, not being accountable to the central government. All of this will pave the way for them to ultimately seize the top administrative power in Hong Kong.

 This not only is incompatible with the true meaning of democracy, but also harms the national sovereignty and security, challenges the power of the central authorities and the authority of the Basic Law of the HKSAR, and uses Hong Kong to infiltrate and undermine the mainland.

 They make loud voices for democracy, but what they had done hindered Hong Kong’s democracy.

 Before returning to the motherland, Hong Kong had no democracy. Its governor was appointed by the British Queen, and also served as the president of the legislative council.

 It is after Hong Kong's return to the motherland that its democratic system was truly established and developed.

 The Basic Law stipulates that the Chief Executive and all the members of the Legislative Council shall be selected by universal suffrage. Since the establishment of the HKSAR, the central government has been supporting the region in steadily and rapidly developing democracy in accordance with the Basic Law and other relevant decisions made by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

 However, the universal suffrage bill, which had won the support from most Hong Kong residents, was aborted due to the opposition of some Legislative Council members in 2015.

 The opposition forces and “Hong Kong independence” activists made no mention of their disruptive role in Hong Kong’s democracy process, but misdirected the young people into believing that the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 sets out the implementation of “dual universal suffrage”, begging external forces to meddle in Hong Kong affairs through passing the so-called “Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act”.

 These practices have sabotaged Hong Kong’s democratic politics, showed no sense of responsibility, and proved that democracy was used as an excuse for certain people to destabilize Hong Kong and achieve their anti-China agenda.

 Hong Kong’s democracy process must be in line with Hong Kong’s political status that is completely and clearly defined by the following three terms in the Basic Law. “Hong Kong has been part of the territory of China since ancient times.” “The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China.” “The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be a local administrative region of the People's Republic of China, which shall enjoy a high degree of autonomy directly under the Central People's Government.”

 Hong Kong's democratic politics is a democracy adopted by a local administrative region of China. Hong Kong's democratization must be based on the premise of ensuring the sovereignty of the central government over Hong Kong under the Basic Law. It must not only conform to the interests of Hong Kong but also the national sovereignty, security and development benefits.

 Hong Kong's universal suffrage system must be in line with the Basic Law and relevant decisions of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress whenever a political reform is initiated. This is the dialectical unity of “one country” and “two systems” under the “one country, two systems” principle.

 In the book Democracy in America, French scholar Alexis de Toqueville wrote: “I am very far from thinking that we ought to follow the example of the American democracy, and copy the means which it has employed to attain its ends.”

 Democracy is not invariable or to be copied. Anyone with practical experience of political reforms would understand this."
Hands off Hong Kong: China slashes UK's interference in HKSAR,"China on Wednesday expressed firm opposition to the recent comments on Hong Kong made by British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, urging him to stop wanton interference in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) affairs.

 “In the minds of some people, they regard Hong Kong as still under British rule. They forget (…) that Hong Kong has now returned to the embrace of the motherland,” Chinese ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming said at a press conference held at the Chinese embassy in London.

 According to The Times, Hunt said on Tuesday that he expected China to honor the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which was signed in 1984 when Margaret Thatcher was the British prime minister, and that ""there will be serious consequences if that internationally binding legal agreement were not to be honored.""

 China resumed sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, and the Chinese government has started administering it in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law and fully implements the principles of ""One Country, Two Systems"" ever since.

 The Chinese ambassador said he was disappointed by the position the UK government chose to take. ""It has made inappropriate remarks not only to interfere in the internal affairs of Hong Kong but also to back up violent lawbreakers.

 ""It even attempted to obstruct the Hong Kong SAR government from bringing the criminals to justice, which is an utter interference in Hong Kong's rule of law.""

 HK had no democracy at all during British colonial rule

 ""He seems to be fantasizing in the faded glory of British colonialism and obsessed with the bad habit of criticizing and lecturing on other countries' affairs condescendingly,"" China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said in response to Hunt's statement at a daily press briefing on Wednesday.

 Geng said he wanted to remind Hunt that Hong Kong had no democracy at all during the British colonial rule, and the Hong Kong people had not even the rights to take to the streets to protest.

 In response to Hunt saying the government of the HKSAR should not use the storming of the region's Legislative Council (LegCo) complex by demonstrators as a pretext to ""repress"" its people, Geng said Hunt was calling black white by saying so since the storming of the LegCo Complex on July 1 was a severe violation of law.

 Stressing that Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs, Geng said China advises Britain, especially Hunt, to stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs as it is doomed to fail."
"U.S. congressman's remarks on Hong Kong ""double standard"": Chinese FM spokesperson","BEIJING, July 29 -- The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Monday said some European and American people are abiding by double standards by shielding rioters in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and turning a blind eye to their violence and illegal acts.

 Spokesperson Hua Chunying's remarks came as Eliot L. Engel, chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said that he was ""deeply concerned by the reports of police brutality in response to peaceful protests in Hong Kong,"" and that ""allegations of police violence over the past weeks have tarnished Hong Kong's international reputation for good governance and the fair administration of justice.""

 Hua expressed her doubts on Engel's comments and said he has ""turned white to black"" and ""confused right and wrong.""

 ""How can some Americans use the words 'peaceful protests' when seeing violent protesters storm the Legislative Council Complex and besiege the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR, not to mention the organized assault on police by lethal weapons?"" Hua asked.

 She recalled a resolution passed by the European Parliament earlier this year which stressed that demonstrations and freedom of expression, which are not without limits, must be exercised within the law and subject to police enforcement restrictions.

 Hua also said during the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011, the New York authorities intensified police by gathering policemen from eight cities, deploying explosion-proof vehicle, riot squads, snipers and horse teams and using weapons such as electric batons and taser guns.

 Saying the U.S. police have repeatedly mentioned force must be used when there is any threat to the lives of the officers, Hua wonders if officers in Washington D.C. and New York were assaulted in the same way as those in the HKSAR, what the U.S. police would do.

 She reiterated that the central government firmly supports the HKSAR government in exercising effective governance and the police there in punishing lawless and violent acts in accordance with the law, so as to safeguard long-term stability, development and prosperity of the city.

 All people with a sense of justice and all citizens who truly love Hong Kong should make joint efforts for Hong Kong's long-term peace and stability, Hua added."
Spotlight: Diplomats join HK NGO representative to condemn violent demonstrators,"GENEVA, Sept. 11 -- Diplomats from various countries responded positively to the speech delivered Wednesday by Pansy Ho Chiu-king, chairperson of the Hong Kong Federation of Women, at the 42nd session of the United Nations Human Rights Council.

 They also joined the HK NGO representative to condemn violent demonstrators in Hong Kong and called for calm and normal social order in the Chinese special administrative region.

 In her speech, Ho condemned the ""increasingly escalating violent acts"" in the Chinese city, called for the international community to reprimand those organizers and influencers and help to stop promoting hatred and violent extremism which could only ""leave irreparable scars to forever stripe our beloved city of harmony and stability.""

 Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, who came to address the UN rights body session here, told Xinhua that ""people should respect the law and not create a disorder situation"" that will ""undermine the environment of investments and peace and tranquility in Hong Kong.""

 Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun, permanent representative of Myanmar to the United Nations Office at Geneva (UNOG), said ""we should condemn any violent acts there.""

 ""What is happening in Hong Kong is an internal affair of China, and the principles of non-selectivity, objectivity, no-politicization and very importantly, non-interference in the internal affairs of another country, should be respected,"" said the ambassador.

 Jorge Valero, permanent representative of Venezuela to the UNOG, expressed ""the most robust rejection of the acts of violence perpetrated in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in recent weeks.""

 He said these are ""events openly promoted by foreign interests to damage the internal order, public security and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China.""

 Sisaketh Sitsangkhom, Lao deputy permanent representative to the UNOG, said the Hong Kong demonstrations have not been peaceful and that they undermine the security and economy there.

 ""I think that the international community would have a better understanding of what has been happening in Hong Kong through the statement of the representative of the Hong Kong Federation of Women,"" he said.

 ""The violent protests in Hong Kong have drawn the attention of the international community as the majority of Hong Kong people have been affected. Their safety is under threat posed by protesters,"" he added.

 Mao Junxiang, executive director of the Center for Human Rights Studies at China's Central South University, who is here to attend the UN meetings, said the demonstrations in Hong Kong ""surpassed the scope of peaceful demonstrations and have seriously undermined the social order, endangering Hong Kong."""
"HK police release details on riots, vow justice will be served","Violent protests undermine rule of law. In a statement sent to Global Times on Monday, Hong Kong law enforcement officials provided further details about the unlawful assembly and violence that erupted Sunday night in Sha Tin.

 Just as they had done before, police officers facilitated the participants in expressing their views during the public procession in Sha Tin on Sunday afternoon.

 However, upon arrival at Yuen Wo Road, demonstrators refused to follow the planned route and started blocking nearby roadways, the statement said.

 Afterward, an unlawful group assembled along Sha Tin Rural Committee Road, Yuen Wo Road and Wang Pok Street.

 The group quickly distributed equipment including helmets and goggles.

 Some protestors pried up bricks from pavements, stocked up considerable number of iron poles and other offensive weapons, demolished the railings nearby, and blocked the roads by railings and other miscellaneous objects.

 ""The police, with the mission of upholding the law of Hong Kong, would definitely stand at the forefront to maintain public safety and order,"" the statement said.

 Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor condemned the ""rioters"" at Sunday's Sha Tin protest, as online videos showed police being attacked by protesters wearing black shirts, masks, and goggles.

 Violent protestors deliberately attacked police officers and charged police cordon lines with different materials including traffic cones and unknown powder, Hong Kong Police said.

 Later that evening, most of the demonstrators had dispersed. Some remaining protesters hurled bricks, umbrellas and helmets at the police officers on the platform of shopping arcades near Wang Pok Street and its vicinity.

 In a chatroom on Telegram, a messaging service used by the protesters to organize and send information, a Global Times reporter saw protesters sharing information on the location of police officers and strategies used to escape, proving Sunday's violence was carefully orchestrated.

 Police officers were attacked while entering the arcades and thus deployed appropriate force to arrest violent protesters.

 One officer claimed his finger was bitten off by protesters. The ongoing violence shocked Hong Kong residents and internet users throughout the Chinese mainland.

 According to the statement, police arrested 47 protesters, including 29 men and 18 women for unlawful assembly, assault, obstruction, and weapons possession.

 Among the 13 police officers sent to local hospitals for treatment, five are still receiving treatment.

 Lam visited the wounded police officers at a hospital in Tai Po on Monday, the South China Morning Post reported.

 Lo Wai-chung, Hong Kong Police commissioner, vowed to find those responsible and hold them accountable, the report also noted.

 The aim of police enforcement is to maintain law and order and uphold the rule of law, Hong Kong Police said.

 ""Police will conduct an active investigation into the recent violent acts and take enforcement actions to bring those responsible to justice,"" it added."
Commentary: U.S. opportunists and HK separatists -- expedient bedfellows with doomed plots,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 21 -- Hong Kong separatist Joshua Wong Chi-fung and some U.S. lawmakers receiving Wong here in recent days have been trying to convince the world that they are the champions of ""freedom"" and ""democracy"" in Hong Kong. The truth is, they are no more than expedient bedfellows.

 At a U.S. Congressional committee's hearing on Tuesday and throughout his stay in the United States over the week, Wong fabricated ""police brutality,"" whitewashed rioters' violent crimes that have seriously damaged the economy and people's way of life in the international financial hub, and begged for U.S. intervention in what should be China's internal affairs.

 As Wong got down on his knees and fawned before a bunch of U.S. lawmakers like U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who has been known for building his political fame on smearing China, he was selling his soul and China's vital sovereign interests to the devil.

 On the outside, Wong acted like he cared about the ""one country, two systems"" principle. Yet on the inside, Wong and his like-minded separatist fellows are attempting to court foreign powers to undermine the very policy that has ensured Hong Kong's smooth return to China more than 22 years ago and the city's continued stability and prosperity over the decades, deny Beijing's constitutional responsibilities over Hong Kong, and get more greenbacks and headlines from the United States for their anti-China political movements. In their eyes, Hong Kong's autonomy and Beijing's legitimate jurisdiction are mutually exclusive.

 However, these U.S. politicians will disappoint Wong eventually. That's because people like Pelosi and Rubio are pure opportunists who are only interested in using these separatists to get attention and put on get-tough-on-China political shows so as to score cheap political points.

 By urging U.S. firms to suspend sales of law enforcement equipment to Hong Kong, staging one-sided hearings and pushing for the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, the motives of the Pelosis and the Rubios are simple: to portray themselves as the guardians of Western values.

 However, when U.S. police used pepper spray and rubber bullets against demonstrators in the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement, politicians like Pelosi neither stood up against police brutality nor spoke up for the rights of the protesters. The hypocrisy and double standards of their Hong Kong moves are too obvious to miss.

 More ironically, these arrogant politicians seem to be serving American voters by pointing fingers at the internal affairs of other countries. Given America's highly-charged partisan politics and an utterly fractured society, perhaps they find it a lot easier and more cost-effective to make trouble for others than to fix real problems perplexing the United States, like stopping the ever rampant shootings.

 What truly matters to them is their own political self-interests, not the so-called human rights or liberty in Hong Kong they pretend to champion or the well-being of the American public, not to mention the interests of those foreign extremists like Wong. As long as they can get elected, nothing seems to be beneath their bottom line, if they have one.

 At the end of the day, the plots by Wong, Pelosi and Rubio will go under. They have overestimated their ability to stoke anti-China sentiment in the international community, and underrated Beijing's determination to stop violence and restore order and stability in Hong Kong according to law. More importantly, their ultimate defeat has been preordained by the expedient nature of their bedfellowship."
Commentary: Media should respect facts as violence threatens HK stability,"A good media report reflects facts, and a bad one shows no respect for the truth, instead instigating public emotion. When it comes to Hong Kong affairs, some media outlets have chosen to show their bias.

 The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government’s amendments of the extradition law prescribe to real problems. It makes sense that the changes may cause controversy. The key is to handle disagreements and differences through negotiation and communication.

 However, some Hong Kong media outlets distorted facts by depicting legal issues as political ones and creating fear among the public through subversive articles. They also exaggerated the scale of the anti-government protests and smeared the police force.

 Taking rumors as proof, resorting to irrationality and hyping up the real situation, these media outlets have abused the freedom of the press.

 When an illegal, violent demonstration takes place, the lenses always avoid the perpetrators but focus on law enforcement. They allow protesters to speak in front of the camera like actors reading a script.

 However, when patriots in Hong Kong speak for justice, reject violence, and launch peaceful gatherings to safeguard Hong Kong, they are silenced.

 It is clear that the facts are the facts they like, the truth is the truth they need, and the story is the story they write. They are more like a political group than media outlets.

 Hong Kong has a great tradition of running newspapers, and there are also excellent reporters. Adhering to the concept of justice and advanced concepts, generations of media writers have used their pens to supervise society and slam chaos, faithfully recording history and the evolution of the times.

 Do reporters in Hong Kong still have a sense of mission and fairness? Could they faithfully tell the public facts about the history and the times? We believe they could, but it’ll take some time."
Women representative condemns violent unlawful acts in Hong Kong at UN session,"GENEVA, Sept. 11 -- Pansy Ho Chiu-king, chairperson of the Hong Kong Federation of Women, on Wednesday condemned the ""increasingly escalating violent acts"" in the Chinese city.

 In an oral statement delivered at the ongoing 42nd session of the UN Human Rights Council here in Geneva, Ho said that since June 6, HK people have been plagued with over 130 protests in which 110 ended in unprovoked violence and unlawful acts, driving hundreds of small businesses to close down and many workers jobless.

 ""We condemn the increasingly escalating violent acts of HK's radical protestors,"" she noted.

 The HK NGO representative told the Council that ordinary HK citizens are the hardest hit victims.

 ""An alarming rate of young children are running away from home to become frontline riot fighters in full gear and weaponry, radicalized to perpetrate criminal acts,"" she said, adding that children of all age are indoctrinated with police-hatred at school and online, and mobilized to conduct massive school strikes.

 She added that those who reject to follow, especially police's children, will be maliciously harassed, intimidated and bullied both physically and on the internet.

 ""We will not tolerate child exploitation and we call for the international community to reprimand those organizers and influencers,"" she said, adding that promoting hatred and violent extremism could only leave irreparable scars to forever strip our beloved city of harmony and stability."
HK chief vows reform of governance,"Top executive of SAR says changes will help ensure variety of voices are heard

 Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, vowed on Tuesday that her government would reform its governance style to ensure different voices are heard and addressed.

 The pledge was made after Lam confirmed that an unpopular extradition amendment proposal that has been the subject of controversy is ""dead"", without any plan to restart it, and attributed the government's ""complete failure"" to amend the city's extradition law to her administration's deficiency in gauging public sentiment.

 Speaking before a weekly meeting with her policy advisers at the Executive Council, the Hong Kong leader said her administration will continue to serve the city, and she expressed hope that the community will give her and her team a chance to mend the rift and take the city forward through ""a new governance style"".

 To better address different views from people of various backgrounds in the community, Lam said the government will reform the existing consultative machinery and build a more open platform to facilitate dialogue with people from diverse backgrounds.

 Lam herself will take the first step in this endeavor, saying she is ready to conduct open dialogues with university students. But she said she hoped the communication would take place without any prerequisites.

 Other measures include a major change in the constitution and operation of the Youth Development Commission, an advisory body to the government on youth work, headed by Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung with some 40 members from various sectors in the city, Lam said.

 Lam also said she has asked principal government officials to review any potentially controversial policies to see whether more public consultation is needed.

 From her administration team to the Executive Council, Lam pledged that a more down-to-earth approach will be taken to better grasp public opinion and concerns.

 Lam's remarks came after a series of large protests against the government's proposed extradition bill, with some having turned into violent clashes with the police and, in one case, the vandalizing of the SAR's legislature chambers.

 ""Saddened and shocked"" by the unrest, Lam called on people with different views to express themselves in a peaceful and orderly manner.

 She stressed that granting amnesty to people arrested during the protests, as some have requested, would be against the rule of law in Hong Kong and would deviate from the Basic Law, which stipulates that prosecutorial decisions of the Department of Justice must be free from any interference.

 Dozens of protestors have been arrested since mid-June on charges including unlawful assembly, assaulting a police officer and in crimes related to rioting.

 Ip Kwok-him, member of the Executive Council, affirmed Lam's pledge to listen to more diverse voices, saying it will ensure better governance and help eliminate misunderstanding and defuse conflict in the community.

 Kenneth Leung Yuk-wai, member of the Youth Development Commission, welcomed Lam's decision to reform the commission and conduct open dialogues with students, calling it an ""olive branch"".

 He said he thought it will help the government to better address young people's concerns."
"Netizens censure Amazon for selling ‘offensive’, ‘disrespectful’ Hong Kong T-shirts","T-shirts with slogans like ""Free Hong Kong, Democracy Now"" on Amazon's website Photo: a screenshot of the Amazon website 

 US online retail giant Amazon has irritated many in China on Wednesday after some netizens revealed it was selling T-shirts with images and slogans supporting violent protests in Hong Kong and their secessionist movement, which many view as not only offensive but also in violation of China's sovereignty.

 After seeing screenshots of T-shirts with slogans such as ""Free Hong Kong, Democracy Now,"" many took to social media to express their anger toward the US firm. ""Amazon, you can leave China! You don't even need to apologize this time,"" one user on Sina Weibo said.

 Coming at a sensitive time when many in the country are frustrated over persistent violence in Hong Kong and over foreign interference in China's internal affairs regarding Hong Kong, ""Amazon T-shirt"" instantly became a trending topic on Wednesday, with nearly 110 million views on Sina Weibo as of press time.

 A search on Amazon's website returned results which showed the T-shirts in screenshots circulating online with slogans like ""Free Hong Kong, Democracy Now.""

 Search results also found two black T-shirts that featured a slogan on the front that reads ""[No] China extradition"" with a Bauhinia apparently substituted for the letter ""O."" The two-shirts were under the category, ""Hong Kong Extradition Law Democracy Protest Shirt.""

 A Beijing-based consumer, who only gave his last name as Jia, said he was ""shocked"" to see such T-shirts being sold on Amazon, which, as the largest e-commerce firm in the world, ""should be clear on the fact that Hong Kong is part of China and the special administrative region returned to the motherland in 1997.""

 ""No respect for the 'one country, two systems' principle and selling these T-shirts on its own platform severely damage the company's reputation and I won't buy anything on it anymore,"" Jia told the Global Times on Wednesday. ""If it cannot respect your country, how can you expect it to respect consumers or markets?""

 Zhang Yiwu, a cultural expert at Peking University, told the Global Times Wednesday that ""as an enterprise, it should comply with the principle when doing business.""

 ""Although there won't be a huge impact on the company in the short term, it will harm the feelings of Chinese consumers in the long run, which is bound to cripple its development in the country,"" said Zhang.

 Amazon China did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. After struggling to compete with local e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba and JD.com, Amazon announced in April that it would shut down its e-commerce business in China, but Chinese shoppers can still buy products on Amazon shipped from overseas.

 There are also similar T-shirts listed on Amazon by other sellers. A seller called Lynstore listed a black T-shirt that featured a yellow umbrella - the symbol of the secessionist movement in Hong Kong - in between the letters ""I"" and ""HKG.""

 In the product description section, where sellers are required by Amazon to write details about the merchandise such as color and material, the seller wrote a clear political message and sought to rally support for the secessionists.

 ""Show Support! The HKG (Hong Kong) umbrella movement was a student campaign to pressure the government to grant Hong [Kong's] electoral reform as promised,"" the seller wrote. Amazon did not list any information about the seller.

 Amazon is the latest company to come under fire in China for products and actions that many Chinese see as disrespect to China's sovereignty and, in turn, Chinese consumers. Fashion brands such as Versace, Givenchy and Coach have been facing a backlash after listing Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan as countries independent of China."
Prominent HK women speak out against protests,"Pansy Ho Chiu-king (left) and Annie Wu Suk-ching at the press conference at the 42nd session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland on Sept 10, 2019. Photo provided to China Daily

 Two prominent Hong Kong women want to tell the world that the violent protests in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region these past few months have marred the stability and prosperity of the global financial hub.

 Pansy Ho Chiu-king, chairwoman of the Hong Kong Federation of Women, said she wants to speak up about the truth in Hong Kong.

 Ho and Annie Wu Suk-ching, a founding member of the federation, were scheduled to speak Tuesday afternoon at the 42nd session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland.

 Speaking to the media on Monday, Ho said that she spent the past three months feeling puzzled and distressed.

 The daughter of Hong Kong and Macao-based businessman Stanley Ho, she said many Hong Kong people are afraid to venture outside due to the violence, and businesses－especially small and medium-sized enterprises－have been hit hard.

 On July 1, mobs stormed Hong Kong's Legislative Council building, smashing glass doors and vandalizing the interior. On Aug 12 and 13, Hong Kong International Airport was largely shut down as protesters and mobs blocked the departure hall. In other protests, mobs threw gasoline bombs at police and damaged several subway stations.

 ""We hope to bring back peace and the rule of law to our society,"" Ho said.

 She felt puzzled as to why the overseas media never reported on the fear caused by the riots among the ordinary people living in Hong Kong.

 Ho expressed that she is not pointing fingers and it is true that there are differences in society that deserve attention.

 ""But we must try to look for a solution in a peaceful manner and with mutual respect instead of escalation,"" she said.

 Ho praised Hong Kong police for their professionalism, saying, ""They did the best they could.""

 Wu, also a businesswoman and daughter of James Tak Wu, founder of Maxim's Catering, said that the actions by mobs who damaged Hong Kong's subway system, blocked the airport and damaged public facilities, have sullied the city's global reputation. ""It's dangerous because people think that Hong Kong is no longer safe,"" she said.

 In her written remarks presented to the human rights council, Ho said the foundation of Hong Kong's prosperity and stability has been shaken to the core by violent protests over the past two months.

 Spreading misinformation across different platforms locally and internationally, instigating disturbances in public places, destroying public and government property, engaging in acts with the intention to cause bodily harm to the police and private citizens, vilifying the police to create public hatred and engaging in unlawful acts to provoke reactions from police are all part of a grand scheme created by the radical protesters to undermine the Hong Kong government's authority to maintain social order, according to the remarks."
Hong Kong's EAC calls for end of violence to hold peaceful election,"HONG KONG, Nov. 7 -- The Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC) of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Thursday called for the stop of all threats and violence so as to hold the 2019 District Council Ordinary Election in a peaceful and orderly manner.

 The election will be held on Nov. 24.

 A spokesman for the EAC said that over 4.13 million registered electors can vote in the election, and their right for voting should not be interfered by violence or any improper conduct.

 The election should be held in a peaceful, fair, open and safe manner, said the spokesman.

 As the polling day is approaching, the EAC calls on all sectors of the society to exercise restraint, respect and be inclusive to people with different views.

 The EAC is devoting all its efforts to prepare for the election and formulate contingency plans for possible incidents to ensure the election can be held in an open, fair and honest manner, said the spokesman, adding the smooth proceeding of election owes much to the full cooperation of all Hong Kong residents.

 The spokesman stressed that it is the expectation of all the candidates and electors to have a smooth election. As such, different sectors of the community should respect each other, and should not sabotage the long-standing good election culture in Hong Kong or obstruct the election.

 There have been concerns as continued protests, confrontations and violent incidents have occurred recently, especially during the weekends, with candidates of the election and public figures assaulted and offices of members of the Legislative Council and District Councils vandalized, the spokesman said, adding the situation is indeed worrying and the EAC does not want to see any threat or violence during the election.

 Hong Kong is divided into 452 District Council Constituency Areas under 18 districts. The District Council has a function to advise the HKSAR government on district affairs. Each term of office for the District Council is four years."
"1,183 arrested over violence in Hong Kong since June: police","HONG KONG, Sept. 4 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong police arrested 35 people in violent protests in different parts of Hong Kong on Tuesday, bringing the total number of the arrested since June 9 to 1,183, the police told a media briefing on Wednesday.

 Radical protesters committed violent acts in different parts of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon on Tuesday, including blocking roads, besieging the Mong Kok police station and damaging facilities at underground railway stations, said Chief Superintendent Tse Chun-chung of Police Public Relations Branch.

 A total of 30 males and 5 females, aged between 14 and 39, were arrested on Tuesday over offences including unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapons and criminal damage.

 In an operation in Kowloon East area on Tuesday night, the police stopped a bus carrying dozens of radical protesters who had caused extensive damage to Wong Tai Sin MTR station, and arrested 33 people.

 Senior Superintendent Foo Yat-ting of the police Kowloon East Region said these protesters were liable not only to the offense of contempt of court as they defied the injunction order for the MTR system, but also to offences such as criminal damage.

 Likening the ongoing violent protests in Hong Kong to an infectious disease, Tse said the disease is ""spreading across the city and poisoning the minds of many young people.""

 ""There is certainly no quick cure to the disease. Every person in the society has a role to play in nursing Hong Kong back to health,"" he said, ""We sincerely appeal to every member of the public to join us. Please make a clear break with all violent and criminal elements to put Hong Kong back on the right track."""
"Legal professionals of Hong Kong deplore damage of legal system by illegal gatherings, violence","HONG KONG, July 29 -- Violent protesters organized illegal gatherings and even attacked police officers in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) at the weekend. Members of the Hong Kong legal profession deplored these radical acts, which they say have sabotaged the social peace and challenged the legal system.

 The legal professionals called upon all members of the society to show support for the Hong Kong Police Force in maintaining the rule of law, so as to restore the social order as soon as possible.

 CHALLENGE OF LAW NEVER TOLERATED IN ANY SOCIETY

 The protesters have been deliberately breaking the law during the past two days as the police have clearly objected to the application for the public processions and the Appeal Board on Public Meetings and Processions have also rejected the relevant appeal, said Tony Kan Chung Nin, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and founding chairman of the Association of Hong Kong Professionals.

 ""In any country or region, if people don't obey the law, the society will fall into chaos,"" he said, expressing fury at the Hong Kong opposition camp which has been trying to find excuses for the law-breaking behaviors.

 Every Hong Kong citizen should obey the law in Hong Kong. The gatherings during the weekend were illegal and nobody should ever have participated in the processions, said Jimmy Ng Wing-ka, a member of the Legislative Council of the HKSAR.

 ""The violent protesters have broken many law items, including criminal damage, arson, unlawful assemblies, riot, obstructing police officers' execution of duties, assaulting police officers, fighting in a public place, with some serious violations carrying life imprisonment,"" said Lawrence Ma, chairman of the Hong Kong Legal Exchange Foundation.

 Violence has been escalating during the past month with some people even carrying assaulting weapons. Violence has been overriding the law and is developing into extreme violence, said Maggie Chan Man Ki, solicitor and founding president of the Small and Medium Law Firms Association of Hong Kong.

 Some violent radicals have stormed government buildings and assaulted law enforcers, crossing the bottom line of peace, seriously threatening the public security and rule of law in Hong Kong and severely challenging the ""one country, two systems"" in Hong Kong. These acts should never be tolerated by Hong Kong and the country and should be strongly condemned, said Albert Wu, a practising barrister in Hong Kong.

 The rule of law and spirit of law-abiding have been the key to the long-term peace and prosperity of Hong Kong, said Raymond Li, a trainee solicitor in Hong Kong. Born in Hong Kong and having lived here for 30 years, he said every person who loves Hong Kong feels sorrowful that law-breaking behaviors have been taking place in Hong Kong.

 ""The Hong Kong society has become less civilized and people now are not valuing rational communication as before. Nowadays whoever is more violent becomes the boss. This should never be tolerated,"" he said.

 He called upon all Hong Kong lawyers and Hong Kong citizens to support Hong Kong police in decisively enforcing the law and arresting all law breakers in accordance with the law.

 OPPOSITION CAMP BLAMED FOR ENCOURAGING, CONNIVING SABOTAGE OF RULE OF LAW

 Lawrence Ma expressed sorrow for the undermining of Hong Kong's rule of law, saying, ""Hong Kong, renowned for discipline and rule of law, has been harassed by the bunch of mobs for quite a time. It is a disgrace to Hong Kong.""

 Jimmy Ng said that acts of the illegal protesters have been damaging Hong Kong's legal system and rule of law.

 ""Knowingly breaking the law would spoil the confidence of Hong Kong residents and the international community in the rule of law of the region,"" he said.

 Ng also blamed the spread of illegal acts on the opposition camp. The opposition, according to Ng, has two motives in defending the illegal rallies: firstly, it eyes elections, hoping to rake in more votes; secondly, it is always keen to challenge the government.

 ""Behind the scene of the demonstrations, they (the opposition politicians) stir up and help boost the violent protesters' confidence,"" said he.

 Recalling the remarks made by some opposition leaders during the past over one month, Maggie Chan said the comments from the opposition legislators have whitewashed violence, helping it escalate step by step to the level of the committing of arson and possession of assaulting weapons.

 ""I think those opposition legislators who encourage violence must be held accountable for these violent incidents,"" she said.

 The illegal demonstrations are not merely targeting the proposed amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance, but also the administration of the SAR and the principle of ""one country, two systems,"" she opined.

 Chan called for more support to police enforcement of the law and zero tolerance of illegal acts.

 ""Law and politics are both important. Any political appeals must be made within the framework of the law,"" she said.

 Raymond Li was furious about the opposition's agitative political rhetoric to instigate the youth to stage illegal protests and commit violence.

 He said that the government and the whole legal profession, on the one hand, must sternly condemn the violent acts, and on the other hand must swiftly sue the suspects according to the crime ordinance.

 HONG KONG PEOPLE SHOULD SUPPORT POLICE IN DEFENDING RULE OF LAW

 Speaking highly of the performance of the Hong Kong Police Force, Tony Kan said they have exercised restraint and refrained from excessive use of force and escalation of the conflicts.

 ""The Hong Kong police are very rational and professional in enforcing the law,"" he said, suggesting that the police now are totally justified to boost the use of force when facing violent assaults.

 Echoing Kan, Jimmy Ng said that while being attacked by violent protesters, the police had issued warnings before taking necessary and appropriate measures of force.

 He praised the police for their hardworking and firm attitude, saying, ""Many police officers had to be on duty for more than 10 hours a day under such difficult circumstances to uphold social peace and stability.""

 The whole society should express gratitude to the police for their wholehearted devotion and professionalism, Maggie Chan said, noting that the police are an important force to maintain social stability under the principle of ""one country, two systems.""

 She called on Hong Kong citizens to give full support to the police in strictly enforcing the law, noting that when violent acts escalate, it is even more necessary for the police to fulfil their duties in the utmost efforts in order to bring all offenders to justice.

 Hailing the performance of the Hong Kong police, Raymond Li expressed the hope that the police will stand up to the pressure and perform their duties in accordance with the law.

 Li also called on the Hong Kong people to support the police with actions to help safeguard Hong Kong's peace and stability."
Int'l community slams U.S. passage of Hong Kong-related bill,"BEIJING, Oct. 17 -- The passage of a Hong Kong-related bill by the U.S. Congress, which was a pure interference in China's internal affairs, unveiled the political intentions of those in the U.S. government to weaken China, the international community has said.

 The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 -- moving it a step closer to becoming a law -- which would mandate an annual review to assess whether the Chinese city has sufficient autonomy.

 The U.S. government is giving ""false signals of assurance and support"" to violent protesters in China's Hong Kong, Sourabh Gupta, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Institute for China-America Studies, told Xinhua in a written interview.

 ""With regard to the U.S. role, it has been deeply unhelpful,"" Gupta said.

 ""The real problem has been the U.S. veiled intentions: to first stir the pot, and thereafter to fan the flames of protest by providing oxygen to the worst political and militant elements within the protest movement,"" he said.

 William Jones, Washington bureau chief of U.S. publication Executive Intelligence Review, called such a move of the U.S. Congress a pure ""interference in the affairs of China.""

 ""Many of the activists will be encouraged by this 'support', but if they continue with their destructive vandalism, I think opinion in Hong Kong will turn against them if it hasn't already,"" Jones said.

 The U.S. bill is ""a very prejudicial bill against China and the authorities in Hong Kong,"" Richard Becker, west coast coordinator of the U.S.-based civil rights group Act Now to Stop War and End Racism, said recently at a conference titled ""The U.S. Role in Hong Kong: Behind the Headlines"" in San Francisco, U.S. state of California.

 ""This bill is not based on the objective situation. It's based on the political will of those in Congress and in the White House,"" Becker said.

 ""The so-called 'democracy movement' in Hong Kong must be seen in this light as an integral part of a strategy to weaken, and even to break up China,"" he said.

 Eduardo Regalado, a researcher at Cuba's Center for International Policy, said that the bill is ""a pure interference and disrespect for the international law and relations.""

 ""The United States has double standards on human rights and criticizes only what is convenient for it,"" Regalado said, adding that the bill reflects U.S. intention to restrain China's development.

 Ahmed Gusau Bala, former consul general of Nigeria to Hong Kong, recalled having a ""memorable experience"" in the Chinese city during his tour of duty there.

 Noting that the Hong Kong people often go about their businesses peacefully, Bala said he was shocked to know that the ""beautiful place"" where he enjoyed working and lived happily was plunged into an ""unfortunate situation"" shortly after he ended his duty.

 Every nation, including China, deserves to guard its own sovereignty, he said, emphasizing that China has all it takes to end the ongoing violence in Hong Kong.

 ""If some foreign governments or media are taking sides, then I think it is rather unfortunate,"" as foreign interference in the matter might slow down the peace process, he added."
US Congress accused of 'inappropriate' meddling in HK affairs,"Attempts by the US Congress to interfere in China's internal affairs with the proposed Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act are not only ""inappropriate"", but also against accepted international practices, a major political party in Hong Kong said on Tuesday.

 The message was conveyed by members of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, known as the DAB, to Hanscom Smith, the US consul general to Hong Kong and Macao, in a meeting on Tuesday. The DAB is the largest political party in the city's legislature.

 Starry Lee Wai-king, the DAB's chairwoman, told reporters after the meeting that some US politicians have overreacted to Hong Kong's current situation in supporting the proposed act.

 The act, reintroduced in the US Congress in June, calls for an annual assessment of Hong Kong's autonomy and, if the results were deemed unfavorable, would allow such restrictions as the suspension of Hong Kong's special trade and economic status with the US.

 Lee said the proposed act constitutes meddling in China's affairs via US domestic law, which she said is against the common practices of the international community.

 Holden Chow Ho-ding, who is the DAB's vice-chairman and also a legislator, said the proposed act aims to pressure both the government of the Hong Kong special administrative region and the central government, which could lead to the escalation of tension between China and the US and harm both countries and the rest of the world.

 According to Lee, Smith said he would convey the DAB's message to the US Congress and the government.

 What is happening in Hong Kong is not a crisis of human rights but a crisis of rule of law, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular news conference in Beijing on Tuesday.

 Attacks launched by radical protesters have severely damaged rule of law and security, and it is a top priority to end the violence at an early date, Hua said.

 Also on Tuesday, Hong Kong SAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said the much-awaited dialogue platform with the Hong Kong public will hold its first session next week.

 At a media briefing before the weekly Executive Council meeting on Tuesday, Lam said 100 to 200 people from all walks of life would be invited to next week's talk to discuss deep-rooted problems facing the city. The meeting will be open to the media.

 Lam added that the dialogue platform will adopt other formats, including discussions with randomly selected representatives and in-depth dialogues with small groups of people from various backgrounds.

 The efforts to build such a platform have received positive feedback from the public, Lam said.

 Amid the increasingly violent protests, which have roiled the city for more than three months, the dialogues are a key way for society to break the political impasse, she added. ""Communication is better than confrontation."""
HK street violence attempt to overthrow government: Official,"The protracted social unrest in Hong Kong is an attempt to overthrow the special administrative region government and turn the city into an ""independent or semi-independent political entity"", China's top diplomat in Hong Kong special administrative region said on Thursday.

 Calling the attempt ""no more than wishful thinking"", Xie Feng, commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in HKSAR appealed to the international community to not endorse any form of violence.

 Addressing the opening ceremony of the International Forum on the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, Xie labeled the street violence in Hong Kong as ""virus which is even more deadly than SARS"".

 Protests against the now-withdrawn extradition bill have gripped the city for over four months. Masked, black-clad rioters have hurled petrol bombs at police and committed arson and vandalism to government buildings, metro stations and mainland-related stores and restaurants. The masked protesters also beat ordinary people bloody, solely because the latter voiced different opinions.

 Official data showed that retail sales tumbled 23 percent year-on-year in August, the sharpest monthly drop on record. The city's other economic pillar, the tourism industry, recorded in August a 40 percent year-on-year decline in visitor arrivals. Hotel occupancy has fallen roughly 50 percent and even 80 percent in protest-hit areas.

 Behind the violence, there is the ""black hand"" – the opposition in Hong Kong and foreign forces, who have been selectively blind and deaf to violence, and even told blatant lies to romanticize the unrest, Xie said.

 Their true motive is ""to mess up the city, overthrow the legitimate government, seize jurisdiction, and ultimately destroy ""one country, two systems"" by turning Hong Kong into an independent or semi-independent political entity,"" he said.

 The street violence in Hong Kong has also found its way to the international arena. Protesters in Spain, the UK and Chile have imitated Hong Kong-style street violence.

 Xie warned that should the Pandora's box of street violence be opened and rioters continue to ""defy the law for the sake of justice"" as they claim, human civilization as a whole would be plunged into calamity and no country would be immune.

 He then called on the international community not to remain silent, stand idly by, or gloat at the unrest in Hong Kong, still less endorse the rioters.

 Xie's remarks echoed what spokesman for the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Yang Guang said in early October. Yang noted that the protests in Hong Kong showed signs of ""color revolution"".

 On the same occasion, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor said the city would hold fast to the ""one country, two systems"" principle as well as the rule of law to ride out the ""unprecedented"" political storm Hong Kong is experiencing.

 Noting Hong Kong is facing unprecedented social problems, Somkid Jatusripitak, deputy prime minister of Thailand, said a similar situation occurred in his country before, resulting in Thailand missing out on development opportunities for several years.

 ""In these difficult circumstances, I believe that everyone with inner justice will see the efforts made by the Chief Executive (of Hong Kong) to alleviate the problem in a sensible manner and in a peaceful manner,"" said Somkid."
Hong Kong court grants interim injunction over online information inciting violence,"HONG KONG, Oct. 31 -- The High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) granted an interim injunction on Thursday to restrain people from disseminating online information that encourages violence, the HKSAR government's Department of Justice said.

 A spokesman for the Department of Justice said the Secretary for Justice as guardian of the public interest applied to the court on Thursday for an ex parte injunction to restrain acts concerning abusive use of internet-based platform or medium.

 These acts include willfully disseminating, circulating, publishing or re-publishing on any internet-based platform or medium (including but not limited to LIHKG and Telegram) any material or information that promotes, encourages or incites the use or threat of violence, intended or likely to cause bodily injury to any person unlawfully within Hong Kong, or damage to any property unlawfully within Hong Kong.

 The injunction also restrains persons from assisting, causing, counselling, procuring, instigating, inciting, aiding, abetting or authorizing others to commit any of the aforesaid acts or participate in any of the aforesaid acts.

 Since June, there have been numerous instances of violent protests and vandalizing acts in many districts of Hong Kong including but not limited to criminal damage to property, assaults of the person, riots and arson.

 The use of internet-based platform or medium, given its anonymous and instantaneous nature in communication as well as accessibility, have been abused by some to incite protesters to participate in unlawful activities, to promote the use of weapons and mobilize protesters to damage targeted properties and injure targeted individuals, in particular police officers, the spokesman pointed out.

 Such acts have seriously breached public peace, and posed a grave and genuine danger to the police and members of the public, he added.

 The interim injunction will remain in force till Nov. 15, 2019, according to the spokesman."
Chinese community rallies in San Francisco to support Hong Kong government,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept.8 (Xinhua) -- More than 500 people on Sunday rallied in San Francisco's Chinatown to condemn the violence by radical protestors in the Chinese city of Hong Kong.

 They condemned the violent tactics of the protesters and voiced support for the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in restoring local order and security.

 The rally, organized by the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association (CCBA) and the Committee to Promote the Reunification of China San Francisco Bay Area Chapter (CPRCSF), was attended by all major leading Chinese communities and representatives of overseas Chinese and businesses in Northern California, who waved miniature Chinese national flags and HKSAR flags, and chanted slogans to voice their solidarity with the HKSAR government and Hong Kong police.

 Chu Wen Huang, president of CCBA Board of Directors and president of Ning Yung Benevolent Association, said what has happened in Hong Kong over the past three months reflects poorly on the city in the eyes of the international community.

 Huang noted that radical demonstrators in Hong Kong have continued their ""intolerable"" violent activities, including destroying subway facilities, despite the HKSAR government's decision on Sept. 4 to withdraw the proposed amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance.

 ""We strongly condemn such violence and firmly support the HKSAR government in taking legal action to enforce the rule of law and bring the perpetrators to justice,"" Huang told the pro-HKSAR government supporters.

 ""We cannot tolerate such violence any more and urge all overseas Chinese across the world to stand in solidarity with the people of Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland to say no to these radical elements,"" said the CCBA president.

 CPRCSF President Wei Ming He said, ""The appalling acts of extremism committed by those mask-wearing protesters cannot conceal the ugly nature of their violence, to which the Hong Kong police have exerted maximum restraint.""

 He meanwhile expressed opposition to any foreign interference in the internal affairs of the HKSAR."
"Interview: U.S. gives ""false signals"" to Hong Kong violent protesters, says scholar","NEW YORK, Oct. 14 -- The U.S. government is giving ""false signals of assurance and support"" to violent protesters in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), said a renowned U.S. expert on China.

 ""With regard to the U.S. role, it has been deeply unhelpful,"" said Sourabh Gupta, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Institute for China-America Studies, in a written interview with Xinhua on Monday.

 In terms of the U.S. official policy position, it is ""a reasonable one: the Basic Law is supreme and all parties must adhere to it fully,"" said Gupta.

 ""The real problem has been the U.S. veiled intentions: to first stir the pot, and thereafter to fan the flames of protest by providing oxygen to the worst political and militant elements within the protest movement,"" he said.

 ""Not once have I heard the U.S. strongly condemn the unacceptable violence that we now casually see on a day-to-day basis ... even though both the Hong Kong government and the central government have scrupulously adhered to 'one country, two systems' (principle) throughout the protest period,"" he said.

 The expert noted that the United States is ""giving false signals of assurance and support to the worst elements within the protest movement ... and it is doing so knowingly.""

 ""But it has no scruples running with the hares and hunting with the hounds, regardless of the consequences, so long as it can embarrass Beijing,"" he said. ""This is what U.S. policy has come down to.""

 Gupta said the violent protests in Hong Kong ""should have ended weeks ago,"" as the basic demands that they set to attain were achieved in early September in the form of the withdrawal of the extradition bill.

 The HKSAR government announced on Sept. 4 that it would formally withdraw the proposed amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance.

 At that point, the protesters ""should have been toning down"" their activity and ""pressing their other immediate demands within a civil society dialogue framework,"" said Gupta. ""Instead, they've gone in the opposite direction and are hoping to use their mobilization to effect changes within Hong Kong's system of representation within the LegCo (Legislative Council). This is just plain wrong.""

 ""A deep and illuminating education of what 'one country, two systems' (principle) entails"" is deeply needed, the expert noted.

 As for the violent, radical fringe groups, Gupta said, they deserve ""nothing less than heavy jail sentences."""
HKSAR gov't rejects Britain's six-monthly report on Hong Kong,"HONG KONG, Oct. 31 -- The government of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Thursday rejected a six-monthly report on Hong Kong published by the British government and reiterated that foreign governments should not interfere in any form in the internal affairs of the HKSAR.

 The HKSAR has been exercising ""Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong"" and a high degree of autonomy in strict accordance with the Basic Law, said a spokesman for the HKSAR government in response to the recent British report covering from January to June in 2019.

 The ""one country, two systems"" principle has been fully and successfully implemented and the HKSAR government will continue to implement the principle resolutely in accordance with the Basic Law, the spokesman added.

 The spokesman also noted that safeguarding human rights and freedoms is a constitutional duty of the HKSAR government and the HKSAR government attaches great importance to human rights and freedoms and is determined to safeguard them.

 In terms of the social unrest that has gripped Hong Kong for the past few months, he said some of the protests and public order events became violent and illegal incidents, causing damage to district and community facilities as well as injury to members of the public.

 To cope with the situation, the police have been exercising restraint and have been carrying out enforcement actions in strict accordance with the law, as the purpose of the police's enforcement is to protect life and property of the public, bring offenders to justice and restore public order as soon as possible, said the spokesman.

 Meanwhile, the Independent Police Complaints Council is conducting a fact-finding study on the handling of large-scale public order events since June, including corresponding actions by the police, to ascertain the facts and will prepare a report, which is to be made public, the spokesman added."
"Chief executive: It's time for HK to bring back order, say no to violence","Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuetngor speaks at a news conference in Hong Kong on Monday. Lam said recent chaos has pushed the city to the “verge of a dangerous situation”, but the government will be resolute in ensuring public order. CHINA DAILY

 Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, Hong Kong's chief executive, said on Monday that protesters' sustained acts of disruption are pushing ""our city, the city we all love and many helped to build, to the verge of a dangerous situation"".

 Lam, speaking at a news conference, pledged resolute action to maintain law and order and restore confidence. She said the protests have gone beyond the issue of a now-shelved extradition amendment bill and now are aimed at destabilizing the special administrative region at the cost of the stability of 7 million residents' lives and futures.

 Monday's problems were caused by direct disruption by protesters as well as a general strike in the city.

 Lam said the protesters' actions are a blatant provocation to national sovereignty and challenge the ""one country, two systems"" principle.

 ""We all love Hong Kong and have made different contributions to its stability and prosperity over the years. This is the time for us to rally together to set aside differences and bring back order, and say no to chaos and violence,"" she said.

 It will take time for Hong Kong to restore what has been done to its economy, livelihood and the entirety of society, she added.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po, speaking to reporters, warned that Hong Kong's economy is in great danger from China-US trade tension, the global economic slowdown and many international variables. Locally, many businesses have been affected. Economic growth was negative in the second quarter, and if things stay the same in the third quarter, Hong Kong will fall into a recession, Chan cautioned.

 On Monday, Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry, said in a statement that violent acts by radical protesters in Hong Kong have gone beyond the bottom line of a civilized society and endangered the lives of the city's residents as well as their properties.

 Some in the United States ignore such problems as abuse of power by its police officers but arrogantly criticize and smear Hong Kong police officers who perform their duties in a constrained and civilized manner in the face of violent protesters, Hua said. Some US politicians reveal a double standard through their hypocrisy and arrogance, she said.

 The ministry again urges the US to stop interfering in the affairs of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and sabotaging the SAR government's operation that is based on rule of law, Hua said.

 In a statement issued at around 7 pm on Monday, Tung Chee-hwa, vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, threw his support behind the SAR government and police for doing what's necessary to safeguard the rule of law and bring back peace and order.

 Tung said many residents, facing the risk of being harassed and insulted by ""rioters"", went to work as usual to safeguard Hong Kong's core value by actions.

 Tung said that the nation's sovereignty must not be infringed upon, adding that the rioters' ulterior motive is to take control of the SAR and threaten the central government by taking the public, the city's traffic and social order hostage. That, he said, will not succeed.

 Despite strong criticism, demonstrators planned to go ahead with more protests. Monday's protests left commuters struggling to get to work during the rush hour.

 By noon, changes or suspensions had been forced on 70 bus routes after 15 roads and three tunnels were blocked, Transport Department officials said at a separate media briefing on Monday afternoon. Some 100 traffic lights were vandalized and services were gradually being restored, causing confusion and danger to pedestrians and vehicles.

 Some protesters placed trolleys and bikes on subway tracks and used gasoline bombs that could cause serious damage and injuries, officials said.

 On Monday, police officials said 420 people had been arrested in relation to the protests since June. Monday alone saw 47 men and 35 women arrested on offenses including participating in an unlawful assembly and possession of offensive weapons. In addition, since June, 139 police officers have been injured, with two still hospitalized.

 The personal data of over 1,200 police officers and their families has been leaked. Hate speech and messages against officers, some cursing their children, have been circulated online, officials said."
Commentary: Jimmy Lai's despicable legacy of fomenting chaos in Hong Kong,"BEIJING, Aug. 20 -- The majority of people in Hong Kong have had enough of prolonged radical protests and violence since June. They are especially fed up with media tycoon Jimmy Lai Chee-ying who has continuously fanned up social disorder and even violence.

 Lai, founder of Next Digital and the tabloid Apple Daily newspaper, has played an important role in fomenting the current chaos and instability in Hong Kong.

 By inviting external forces to meddle in Hong Kong affairs, Lai shows how eager he has sought to serve as a political tool for foreign powers to oppose China and cause chaos in Hong Kong.

 Over the years, Lai has tried to destabilize Hong Kong and willfully pushed his own political agenda. His actions challenged the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle and threatened China's national sovereignty.

 Lai bought his status as a proxy in Hong Kong by donating to U.S. political parties. It is through him that foreign anti-China forces channel funding to opposition leaders and a small fraction of so-called ""Hong Kong independence"" forces.

 Meanwhile, Lai frequently met with politicians in the United States. In July, he was received by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to discuss developments related to amendments to the fugitive offenders ordinances and the status of Hong Kong.

 Lai was believed to be the ""black hand"" behind Hong Kong's ""Occupy Central"" incident in 2014. A year before the incident, he went to Taiwan to learn street protest tactics. Lai also used the media he controlled to spread disinformation to the public, create and spread rumors, and fan the fire of hatred and fears against Chinese mainland.

 Lai assumed an active role in the current round of protests and violence. The Apple Daily newspaper that he owns printed ads directly calling on people to take to the street, and created an echo chamber to defame the lawful efforts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government to fix loopholes in the legal system. His smear campaign misled many people in Hong Kong.

 Even though the HKSAR government has announced on many occasions that the amendments have been halted, Lai demanded more. Glorifying rioters and vandalism, and vilifying the police, Lai declared: ""As I watched the protesters kicking the police, I felt an utmost sense of release.""

 As Hong Kong reeled from radical protests and violence, an increasing number of people -- retailers, tour guides, restauranteurs, taxi and truck drivers -- earned less and suffered from the economic hardship, while Lai profited handsomely from the instability.

 After radical protests gripped Hong Kong since June, the market value of Lai's media company rocketed. The market value of Next Digital, of which Lai is the majority stakeholder, surged more than 80 percent in a week after Hong Kong sank into chaos.

 Despite his notoriety of spreading disinformation, Lai branded himself as a spokesperson of the Hong Kong people only to hijack the future of the Hong Kong people.

 Lai claimed that the West has the obligation to lend support to ""change not only the future of Hong Kong but even that of the whole of China,"" a blatant confession of whom he is loyal to.

 History has proved time and again, anyone who betrays his country for personal gains will always be nailed to the pillar of shame in history."
Chinese mission strongly opposes EU's meddling in Hong Kong affairs,"BRUSSELS, Aug. 18 (Xinhua) -- In response to a statement from EU's top diplomat, a spokesperson of the Chinese Mission to the European Union (EU) said on Sunday that China is gravely concerned and strongly opposed to the EU's meddling in Hong Kong affairs.

 EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland issued a joint statement on Hong Kong on Saturday evening.

 The statement said that there have recently been a rising number of violent incidents, that engagement in a process of ""broad-based and inclusive dialogue, involving all key stakeholders, is essential.""

 ""Fundamental freedoms, including the right of peaceful assembly, and Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy under the 'one country, two systems' principle, are enshrined in the Basic Law and in international agreements and must continue to be upheld,"" said the statement.

 It must be pointed out that the ""One Country, Two Systems"" is enshrined in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, not international law, the Chinese spokesperson stressed.

 The Chinese spokesperson urged the EU side to observe international law and the basic norms governing international relations, respect China's sovereignty in good faith, and immediately stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs, so as not to undermine the sound and steady growth of China-EU relations.

 The spokesperson said that the protests and demonstrations in Hong Kong have already evolved into extreme violence. Some radicals ransacked the Legislative Council building, attacked the liaison office of the Central Government and police stations, assaulted the police, committed arson, forced a shutdown of the Hong Kong airport with unauthorized rallies and beat innocent people.

 Such moves have jeopardized the safety and security, law and order of Hong Kong society, put Hong Kong citizens' lives, property and normal life in danger, and posed a grave challenge to the red line of ""One Country, Two Systems,"" and must therefore be seriously condemned and strictly dealt with in accordance with law. In face of such severe violence and offences, no government with a sense of responsibility would sit idly by, said the spokesperson.

 The Chinese spokesperson reiterated that Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs, which brook no interference by any foreign government or organization. The EU side, in disregard of China's objection, has repeatedly meddled in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs. China is gravely concerned and is strongly opposed to such move."
"China refutes U.S., U.K. remarks on Hong Kong violence","BEIJING, Nov. 12 -- China on Tuesday refuted remarks by U.S. and British officials regarding the latest riot in Hong Kong, calling the remarks a reflection of hypocrisy and double standards.

 It was reported that an unnamed senior U.S. official said Monday the U.S. condemned ""unjustified use of deadly force"" in Hong Kong violence, claiming the police and civilians alike ""have a responsibility to de-escalate and avoid violent confrontations.""

 The statement was made after a Hong Kong police officer shot a protester who attempted to snatch his gun.

 U.K. Prime Minister's Downing Street Office earlier also urged all sides to be calm and exercise restraint, adding that the prime minister supported ""the right to peaceful protests.""

 ""If you watch the video clip, you will see clearly that the rioters assaulted the police first and the officer's response was fully lawful,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said.

 Geng told a press briefing that grabbing police firearms, assaulting or threatening officers on duty were absolutely forbidden in any country and would be dealt with strong police force.

 ""I want to ask the U.S. and British officials: How would their police deal with similar situations in their countries?"" Geng said.

 Speaking about a civilian who was set on fire by rioters for publicly expressing his objections to vandalism by the rioters, Geng said the remarks from Washington and London exposed their hypocrisy and double standards.

 ""If they truly oppose violence and call for restraint, like what they said, then why didn't they strongly condemn such attack on ordinary civilians?""

 Geng called attention to the fact that the U.S. government official refused to reveal his name. ""I'm afraid they felt embarrassed themselves in making such remarks.""

 ""Ending violence and restoring order is the paramount task in Hong Kong,"" Geng said, urging the U.S. and the U.K. to respect China's sovereignty and exercise prudence on Hong Kong-related issues and stop meddling in China's internal affairs."
"HKSAR chief executive holds 1st community dialogue to ""seek change for the betterment of Hong Kong society""","HONG KONG, Sept. 26 -- Chief Executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam said Thursday at the first ""Community Dialogue"" session that she hopes to ""seek change for the betterment of Hong Kong society"" through continued dialogues with the public.

 In her opening speech at the session, Lam stressed that the dialogue is ""not just for the sake of dialogue, nor is it a public relations tactic.""

 ""It is to seek change for the betterment of Hong Kong society,"" she said, adding that she hopes more dialogues in different forms will be continuously held in the future in different parts of Hong Kong and more members of the public can participate.

 The first ""Community Dialogue"" session, held Thursday evening at Queen Elizabeth Stadium in Wan Chai, was attended by four secretaries of the HKSAR government and about 150 members of the public selected by computer lot drawing from the over 20,000 people who had registered for attending the session.

 Lam said Hong Kong residents, irrespective of their status and position, felt pain, anxiety and anger in the past three months, and the HKSAR government should shoulder the major responsibility for finding a way out of the current impasse.

 Acknowledging the shrinking public confidence in the HKSAR government and in herself, the chief executive said ""direct dialogue should be initiated no matter how difficult it is.""

 ""I hope we can take the difficult first step with the understanding and support of the public,"" she said.

 Ballots were drawn to select speakers from the audience, each of whom could speak within three minutes. The chief executive and other officials occasionally responded to the speakers.

 Both protesters and opponents of the protests have spoken out during the interactive section, which saw repeated mentions of housing problems, social inequality and politicizing of education, among others.

 One female speaker opposed students' participation in protests and blamed some teachers, social welfare practitioners and religious groups for instigating protests.

 ""Students are not mature enough to engage in politics,"" she said, adding that partiality in the liberal studies course had a bad influence on Hong Kong students.

 She also blasted fake journalists and biased media reports for stirring up troubles, winning thunderous applause from the audience.

 A man who identified himself as among the ""peaceful, rational and non-violent"" protesters, said he was dissatisfied with the social gap and chaos today.

 ""We all have families and children, I don't know how to hand the future to our next generation,"" he said, expressing hope that peace could be restored soon.

 Another speaker noted Hong Kong's exorbitant house prices and yawning wealth gap and asked Lam if measures would be taken to help the young people in terms of housing and employment.

 Since June, Hong Kong has witnessed escalating violence that originated from protests over the proposed ordinance amendments concerning fugitive offenders transfers.

 Though the HKSAR government has withdrawn the amendments, violence continued as protesters veered off their original agenda to raise the ante, causing a split in society and taking a heavy toll on the economy."
HK Financial Secretary: integrating into the country’s overall plan critical to Hong Kong,"As social unrest has crippled Hong Kong for four months, the city’s deep-seated economic and social problems that had been simmering under the surface had come to a boil. In light of this, Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po has pledged more economic and relief measures to solve the perennial problems of Hong Kong, adding that integrating into the overall development plan of the country is becoming more and more critical to Hong Kong.

 Chan’s remarks came after he attended the celebrations in Beijing commemorating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1. In an inclusive interview with People’s Daily Online on Wednesday, Chan expressed his sense of pride in China’s development and its role as a contributor to global peace as he was deeply impressed by the military parade on National Day.

 “Within the current international environment, we need to rise peacefully, so that we can not only protect ourselves but also be an important contributor to global peace,” Chan told People’s Daily Online.

 Healing the wounds

 Months of protests have caused a decline of nearly all economic indicators of Hong Kong in the first half of 2019, hitting a broad spectrum of sectors, such as tourism, catering, and retail industries. Furthermore, the unemployment rate is rising.

 Hong Kong’s Census and Statistics Department reports that the GDP contracted 0.4% in the second quarter. Chan expressed his worries that if the economy shrinks further in the third, Hong Kong’s economy may be dragged into a technical recession.

 Chan said that the Hong Kong government, considering the stress faced by SMEs and citizens, has rolled out an array of measures to help them pull through. In August, the Hong Kong government issued measures with a total expenditure of 19.1 billion HKD to mitigate the impacts of the economic headwinds.

 “For small and medium-sized enterprises, we have reduced their tax burden, provided support in terms of the turnover of funds, and guaranteed their banks’ loans.” According to Chan, SMEs account for 98% of local enterprises and about 45% of total employment, being the mainstay of Hong Kong’s economy.

 Apart from helping SMEs, Chan also pledged more relief measures to help needy citizens. The unaffordability of housing and land shortage has been the most painful and most significant problem of Hong Kong, said Chan, noting that the Hong Kong government has adopted a package of measures to alleviate the problem.

 “We have adopted some initiative approaches, such as increasing land supply, exploring more development areas, and turning farmland into public housing. We will reinforce our efforts in building more self-occupied houses, be it for sale or for rent. We hope to build a certain number of houses in a relatively short time so as to help those who are living in poor housing conditions,” Chan said.

 On Sept. 13, the Hong Kong government gazetted its tax vacancy bill, signifying that all of the six housing initiatives that Chief Executive Carrie Lam proposed in June last year have now been put in place. Chan stressed that this is not a problem that can be solved in a couple of days. However, the Hong Kong government has made great determination to solve it.

 The current situation in Hong Kong, said Chan, let the Hong Kong government hear the voice of the youth and accordingly conduct self-examination. “In the future, we will be more people-oriented, and reach out more to our people, so as to roll out policies that enjoy the support of the people and serve their wellbeing,” he said.

 “We will let our people know more about the Hong Kong government through dialogues. Opening dialogues will help us understand and analyze the problems, and then solve them step by step,” he added.

 Riding the waves

 Hong Kong was both a contributor to and a beneficiary of China’s transformation over the past 40 years, and will play a more significant role in the process of integrating into the overall development plan of the country, including the Belt and Road Initiative and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Initiative, Chan said.

 Hong Kong has been an active player to push forward the Belt and Road initiative. In 2016, the Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO) was established, with a mission to expedite infrastructure investments by working with key countries along the Belt and Road.

 In addition, new opportunities are beckoning as the initiative starts to cover new sectors such as technology, logistics, and trading, said Chan, adding that the Hong Kong Trade Development Council has recently upgraded the BRI website, forming a one-stop platform which provides the latest information such as Hong Kong service providers and investment projects in efforts to reinforce the collaboration of BRI participants.

 Chan also mentioned that the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area further facilitates the regional flow of talent, commodity, capital, and information between Hong Kong and the mainland, strengthening the exchanges of the two sides as well as improving people’s lives and regional development.

 Since his appointment to the government in 2012, Chan noted, he has had a deeper understanding regarding the overall plan of the nation. Thus he has high confidence in the country’s future development. “I have full confidence in ‘one country, two systems,’ as ‘it is the most essential cornerstone of Hong Kong’s success. Furthermore, integrating into the overall development plan of our country is becoming more and more critical to Hong Kong’s economy,” Chan added."
Shenzhen police stage new drill using water cannons to deal with riot,"The People's Armed Police staged a new drill that featured an apparent large-scaled anti-riot exercises in Shenzhen's Bay Sports Center on Thursday, near Hong Kong.

 Hundreds of armed officers took part in the drill in which they confronted rioters holding long batons, according to a video widely circulating online. When riot police marched forward, rioters did not stop moving forward, and some struck the officers with batons, the video showed. The officers then steadily moved forward equipped with firm shields and two water cannons. They began aiming at the rioters before spraying water at them.

 A source close to the matter confirmed with the Global Times that it was an anti-riot drill staged Thursday at Shenzhen Bay Sports Center, and that the video showed the drill was large in scale.

 Within a few seconds, the officers held the situation under control, and rioters began retreating.

 Some rioters threw petrol bombs, but the officers effectively extinguished them.

 Two red flags were spotted among the armed officers. After rioters retreated for a while, some police trucks surrounded them, ending the riot completely.

 The drill mirrors the months-long ongoing protests in Hong Kong, as protesters throw petrol bombs and attack the Hong Kong police with offensive weapons, some internet users on the Chinese mainland said.

 Earlier this month, the armed police have been assembling in Shenzhen, a city bordering Hong Kong, in advance of apparent large-scale exercises. The tasks and missions of the armed police include participating in dealing with rebellions, riots, serious violent and illegal incidents, terrorist attacks and other incidents endangering social safety.

 Also, the Hong Kong Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army conducted the 22nd rotation of its members in the early hours of Thursday since it began garrisoning Hong Kong in 1997, the Xinhua News Agency reported.

 The move is a normal routine annual rotation in line with the Law of the People's Republic of China on Garrisoning the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which was approved by the Central Military Commission.

 Some internet users applauded armed police for being brave and skillful in battle. ""No need for a drill, you guys can handle the riot in Hong Kong now!"" a netizen with a pseudonym of Zhubanxiaomajia said in a Weibo post.

 Although the Hong Kong Police Force issues a letter of objection to the protest organized by opposition groups set to take place August 31, some observers believe the ban will not stop anti-government protesters from escalating violence."
Hong Kong cancels all flights as protesters disrupt airport,"Cancelled flights are shown on a screen at Hong Kong International Airport in Hong Kong, south China, Aug. 12, 2019. All flights in and out of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region were cancelled on Monday due to a protest held in the Hong Kong International Airport, according to local airport authority. (Xinhua/Wang Shen)

 HONG KONG, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- All flights in and out of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region were cancelled on Monday due to a protest held in the Hong Kong International Airport, according to local airport authority.

 All check-in services were suspended, said the Airport Authority Hong Kong in a statement on Monday afternoon, adding that departing flights that had completed check-in procedures and arriving flights already heading to Hong Kong were excluded from the suspension.

 The Airport Authority Hong Kong said it has launched an emergency management center in the airport and is keeping close contact with airliners to try to resume operation as soon as possible.

 The airport authority also advised the public to avoid trips to the airport, citing traffic congestion and full parking lots.

 Four bus services of the airport express have changed route and one bus station in the airport has also been closed, according to local traffic authority."
Hong Kong police in the teeth of the storm,"Unlawful assemblies and violent protests which have lasted for over two months in China’s Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) have put Hong Kong police in the teeth of the storm.

 By the end of this July, the Hong Kong Police Force had a total of more than 30,000 regular and auxiliary police officers, and over 4,000 civilian staff. Since Hong Kong’s return to the motherland, the Hong Kong Police Force has been hailed as one of the world’s most professional police forces.

 Since June, radical protesters in Hong Kong have spared no effort to smear the police and instigate hatred towards police officers.

 As various news reports have shown, the weapons and equipment of the radical protesters in Hong Kong have continuously been upgraded, with dangerous chemicals included. This July, police officers found highly explosive TATP, petrol bombs, and knives in Lung Shing Factory building on Texaco Road in Tsuen Wan, a town in the Western New Territories of Hong Kong.

 The weapons radical protesters carry with them have become increasingly dangerous, noted front line police, disclosing that the radicals’ weapons range from stones, iron rods and slingshots to umbrellas with daggers tied to the end, severely threatening the lives of police officers at the scene.

 On Aug. 18, a spokesman of the Hong Kong SAR government issued a statement expressing sincere regret for some groups holding assembly with slogans targeting the Hong Kong police.

 Over the last two months, police stations across the city have seen 75 separate vandalism attacks, while about 180 police officers have been attacked or injured, said the spokesman.

 Chief Superintendent David Jordan, a British man who has served with the Hong Kong police force for over 20 years, said that the current situation in Hong Kong is the most dangerous that he has faced since he joined. He noted a particular example when more than 100 protesters surrounded a single policeman.

 On the evening of Aug. 13, a police officer was crowded into a corner of the airport and brutally beaten by radical protesters. With his life being seriously threatened, he had to point a gun at the radicals to save his life.

 Even civilian staff of the police force have been hurt during the riots. According to a police officer in the Police Public Relations Bureau, he is in charge of media contact and was once hit in the waist by a brick thrown by protesters.

 On Aug. 19, Hong Kong police issued a statement responding to accusations of excessive use of force, saying that police officers have exercised “restraint, tolerance and patience”, and “Only when there were violent acts or illegal behaviours which endangered the safety of people at the scene, [officers] would stop them by proportionate use of force to prevent the incidents from heating up and worsening”.

 Dr. Willy Fu, a member of the Hong Kong Basic Law Education Association, and also a former senior inspector of police, told People’s Daily that the high-standard law enforcement of police officers at the scene made him “both proud and sad.”

 Fu said the police have exercised restraint and tolerance at all times, and only used the minimum force needed to prevent incidents at the scene.

 Fu instanced that once a radical protester threw highly corrosive drain cleaner at police officers, but accidentally injured herself. The police officers at the scene, though abused by the woman, immediately provided her with aid. “Such action is admirable,” said Fu.

 Hong Kong citizens have seen these events. A few days ago, a statement released with the signature of “Hong Kong citizens who are no longer silent” pointed out that in the face of irrational, violent acts, the police have been swallowing humiliation and bearing responsibility while trying to maintain public order.

 Those who accused the police of abuse of force are calling white black, said Elizabeth Quat, a lawmaker of the Legislative Council, saying the truth was that radicals blocked the roads and attacked, threw things at, and besieged police officers first, and the police officers just used appropriate force to stop the violence and restore social order."
Any attempt to interfere in Hong Kong affairs doomed to fail: FM spokesperson,"BEIJING, Aug. 7 (Xinhua) -- A foreign ministry spokesperson said Wednesday that any attempt to interfere in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs is doomed to fail.

 ""Any attempt to undermine the 'one country, two systems' and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability will surely be resolutely opposed by all Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots,"" said spokesperson Hua Chunying.

 Hua's remarks came when responding to a query about two U.S. senators' comments on the situation in Hong Kong.

 She said that the senators had failed to tell right from wrong and spoke nothing about the serious consequences of the radical, violent and illegal behaviors. Instead, they smeared the just actions taken by the Hong Kong police who have all along been professional, highly restrained and committed to safeguarding the rule of law and social order.

 The recent protests and demonstrations in Hong Kong have turned into radical violent acts that seriously violate the law, undermine security and social order in Hong Kong, and endanger local people's safety, property and normal life, she said.

 ""No responsible government would turn a blind eye to such serious violent crimes,"" Hua stressed.

 The Chinese side once again urges the relevant American politicians to immediately stop condoning violent crimes and grossly interfering in Hong Kong affairs, she said."
"Op-Ed: The miscalculation of Tsai Ing-wen's ""US show""","Last week, the United States played the Taiwan card against China, allowing Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen to use the United States as a platform to promote “Taiwan independence” and undermine China-US relations. In New York, she seized every opportunity she could to make a show of it, serving as a pawn for foreign powers to interfere in China’s internal affairs.

 Her arrival was met with protest on the streets of New York and even prompted Cui Tiankai, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, to send out a tweet: “Taiwan is part of China. No attempts to split China will ever succeed. Those who play with fire will only get themselves burned. Period.”

 She made the trip amid trade frictions between China and the United States and just days after the US Defense Department approved a $2.2 billion arms sale to the island, which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China said violates international law and norms in international relations, the One China Principle, and the three joint communiques between China and the United States, and undermines national sovereignty and security.

 Right now, Taiwan is gearing up for a leader election in January. During the island’s election season, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will go to great lengths to provoke and anger the mainland and sow fear and hatred among voters. This time, Tsai Ing-wen passed through the United States to “play president” and incite hatred against the mainland.

 While in New York, Tsai Ing-wen spoke about “democracy, freedom, and human rights,” emphasizing that “Taiwan stands on the frontlines of democracy” to strike the right note with Americans. However, the facts are what they are.

 As China has pointed out on many occasions, the DPP uses “freedom, democracy, and human rights” as a fig leaf to mask its intention to split China. Thus, the DPP will ostentatiously parade “Taiwan independence” advocates but will make a monkey out of those who advocate national reunification.

 In the closed-door talks at Columbia University, Tsai Ing-wen tried to convince her audience that Taiwan is a sovereign state and took the opportunity to attack the practice of “one country, two systems” in Hong Kong, exposing her intention to split China.

 “One country, two systems” is the best solution for Hong Kong. It has allowed the city to remain prosperous and stable and has proven to be successful in practice. “One country, two systems” is also the best way to achieve national reunification, because it considers the reality of the situation and is conducive to long-term stability.

 In her speech, Tsai Ing-wen tried to throw a monkey wrench into the reunification process by attacking the practice of “one country, two systems” in Hong Kong. But like an ant trying to topple a giant tree, the effort is doomed to fail. China has made it very clear that reunification is inevitable, and it would be a grave mistake to underestimate the will of the Chinese government and people to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity.

 It is common knowledge that China opposes any form of official exchanges between the United States and Taiwan. The United States risks damaging the most important bilateral relationship in the world and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait by violating the One China Principle and the three joint communiques and providing a platform for “Taiwan Independence” advocates.

 For some three decades now, the US side has broken its promises by violating the provisions of the three joint communiques and has shown a tendency recently to intensify such practices, revealing Washington’s desire to contain China by playing the Taiwan card against China.

 It is shameful that the United States has made Taiwan a pawn in its geopolitical game and the island’s leaders are making a major miscalculation if they think “Taiwan Independence” is the best way forward."

 Traffic paralyzed as thousands march, chanting anti-government slogans

 The heart of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region descended into chaos with business partially suspended and traffic entirely paralyzed on Sunday afternoon after masked protesters launched an unauthorized assembly.

 Thousands gathered in the assembly on Hong Kong Island on Sunday, targeting several locations, including Hong Kong's Golden Bauhinia Square flag-raising venue in Wan Chai, the day after an illegal rally turned violent in the city's western part of New Territories Yuen Long.

 The protesters, wearing face masks, defaced property, left graffiti and dismantled metal sidewalk railings along their way in Sai Ying Pun, Sheung Wan, Central and Causeway Bay, the heart of Hong Kong Island, despite continuous police warnings.

 China Daily reporters taking photos at the scene were warned repeatedly and followed by several masked protesters. One used an umbrella to try to stop reporters from taking pictures.

 At about 3:40 pm, thousands of people gathered at Chater Garden, heart of Hong Kong's financial and administrative district, and occupied a major road in a procession toward Wan Chai. Traffic was paralyzed.

 Another group of protesters headed toward Sheung Wan. Some shouted that their target was the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in Sai Wan. A few headed to Sogo, a major shopping mall in Causeway Bay.

 The police stressed that anyone participating in the unauthorized procession was breaking the law and no violence would be tolerated during the event.

 Senior Superintendent of Police Public Relations Branch Yu Hoikwan said in a news briefing at Police Headquarters that the public was urged to take part in the Chater Garden assembly in a peaceful and lawful manner.

 Violent clashes against police that endangered public safety, like those in Yuen Long on Saturday, would not be tolerated, Yu said.

 A similar procession was held on Saturday night in Yuen Long. That illegal march, which was banned by the police out of safety concerns, ended with a bloody and violent clash between some radical protesters and police officers.

 In a statement on Sunday, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government strongly condemned protesters for disturbing the peace and deliberately breaking the law, saying the police would take ""serious follow-up actions"".

 The police also condemned deliberate attacks by violent protesters in a statement on Sunday, stressing they would investigate all illegal and violent acts.

 Joining the condemnation were 39 Hong Kong lawmakers of the pro-establishment camp. In a joint statement on Sunday, they expressed their ""strong discontent"" with rioters and repeated that they opposed all violent and illegal acts.

 Also on Sunday, Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po wrote in his weekly blog that recent violent protests have worried all who are concerned about Hong Kong.

 He called on the public to firmly reject violence. ""Don't let hate and violence take root in and spread over the society.""

 During the nearly seven hours of Yuen Long protest conflicts on Saturday, some radical protesters violently charged police cordons, damaged a police vehicle and blocked roads. They hurled bricks, threw glass bottles containing suspected-corrosive fluids and smoke-producing materials at police trying to disperse them.

 Twenty-four people were injured during the incident, including at least four police officers. At least thirteen men were arrested on charges including unlawful assembly, possession of an offensive weapon, assaulting a police officer and assault.

 On Sunday morning, piles of trash could be seen everywhere near Nam Pin Wai village in Yuen Long. Bricks, bottles, broken umbrellas, damaged fences and graffiti littered the scene of the previous day's rally.

 Also on Sunday, the central government's foreign affairs office in the HKSAR sternly denounced a United States congressman for ""telling bare-faced lies"" and ""slinging mud against conscience"".

 The Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region responded after US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel issued a statement on Friday criticizing the Hong Kong police's handling of recent anti-extradition bill protests.

 By around 8 pm on Sunday, the protesters were dispersed from the Sai Ying Pun area. Train service for Sai Ying Pun, HKU and Kennedy Town stations was temporarily suspended around the same time. Shortly after that, police were seen detaining some protesters.

 At around 8:30 pm, the police issued a statement condemning the protesters for escalating violence."
"Protests, violence take toll on Hong Kong's retail, tourism","HONG KONG, Aug. 2 (Xinhua) -- Weeks of protests and violent incidents have started to dent Hong Kong's retail and tourism sectors, a key part of the economy of the Special Administrative Region (SAR).

 Business owners and industry insiders expressed growing worries and uncertainties as the demonstrations and violence continued to weigh on consumption sentiment.

 ""Protests and violent incidents have forced me to close my shop for several weekends on end,"" said an owner of a seafood store in Sai Wan on the Hong Kong Island, who only gave his surname Cheung. ""Sales have badly dropped and I am losing quite some money.""

 Cheung hoped that the demonstrations could end quickly. ""It is important that the economy stays stable. We ordinary residents just want a peaceful life.""

 The Hong Kong SAR government said on Thursday that the value of total retail sales in June 2019 decreased by 6.7 percent compared with the same month in 2018, as local consumer sentiment turned more cautious and growth in visitor arrivals moderated.

 A government spokesman said the near-term performance of retail sales will likely remain subdued, citing weakened global and local economic outlook and other headwinds.

 The spokesman added that the recent demonstrations, if continued, would also dent the retail business further.

 According to the Hong Kong Retail Management Association, large-scale rallies and protests have dampened Hong Kong's retail performance, with most of the members of the association recording single or double digit fall since June.

 Wong Ka Wo, president of Hong Kong Federation of Restaurant and Related Trades, said weeks of protests have not only hurt visitor arrivals but also dampened consumption of local residents.

 ""The catering business is very important to Hong Kong. A declining willing to consume will put pressure on businesses and dent Hong Kong's economy,"" said Wong.

 Visitor arrivals to Hong Kong totaled around 5.14 million in June, down about 770,000 from the figure in May, according to Hong Kong Tourism Board.

 Hong Kong has seen steady tourism volume in the first five months of the year, but since June, the sector has been hit hard by multiple violent protests, and safety concerns mounted, said Yiu Si-wing, a lawmaker and tourism industry insider.

 ""Many have delayed or even cancelled their trips to Hong Kong,"" he said.

 For Hong Kong's tourism sector, immediate recovery is not likely even if violence ceases soon, Yiu said.

 But if violence continues, many of the tourism-related industries, including hospitality and retailing, will be hurting, and Hong Kong's overall economy will suffer, he added.

 Michael Li, executive director of the Federation of Hong Kong Hotel Owners, said the demonstrations in June have had an impact on Hong Kong's tourism, with the overall hotel occupancy rate dropping about 2 percent.

 He estimated that the occupancy rate for hotels near the protest areas in the Hong Kong Island would decrease more than 10 percent in July and those in Kowloon would drop 5 percent to 8 percent."
"Hong Kong protests turn violent, several policemen injured","HONG KONG, Aug. 26 (Xinhua) -- Protests turned violent in Tsuen Wan, in the western New Territories of Hong Kong, on Sunday as radical protesters hurled petrol bombs at police officers and brutally assaulted them.

 Several police officers were injured after they were attacked by rioters while they were on duty in Tsuen Wan. Hong Kong's Commissioner of Police Lo Wai-chung visited the injured officers in Princess Margaret Hospital on Sunday night.

 Lo expressed strong anger and condemnation against the reckless, violent and unlawful acts and said the police force will strive to investigate all violent acts that have caused serious even life-threatening injuries.

 Sunday's marches took place in Tsuen Wan and neighboring areas. After the marches ended, violent protesters deviated from their routes to attack police officers.

 Some radical protesters hurled bricks and petrol bombs at police officers outside Yeung Uk Road Market in Tsuen Wan. They also aimed strong light beams at the officers and setting up barricades to confront the police.

 Masked protesters, armed with poles and hats, escalated their violence in the afternoon and evening. They blocked various roads in Tsuen Wan, paralyzing traffic in the vicinity.

 Having given repeated warnings to the protesters in vain, anti-riot officers fired tear gas and used minimum force to disperse them.

 At the site, the police repeatedly unfurled signs for the demonstrators to leave, but demonstrators ignored the warning of the police. A police commander at the scene ordered to deploy at least two specialized crowd management vehicles, commonly known as the ""water cannon vehicles"", to disperse the crowd.

 At around 7:30 p.m., many masked demonstrators who had been dispersed gathered again in Yi Pei Square of Tsuen Wan, holding iron bars, wooden sticks and bricks. They smashed doors and windows of several shops and broke some closed-circuit televisions.

 About half an hour later, several anti-riot police officers arrived at the scene where shops were vandalized, and were immediately surrounded and assaulted brutally by a large group of masked radicals holding long metal rods.

 With only small shields for defense, the police officers tumbled backward along the Sha Tsui Road, with the violent protesters chasing after them. In face of the extremely dangerous situation, a police officer fired a warning shot into the sky.

 Superintendent Leung Kwok-wing of the New Territories South Regional Crime Headquarters said the police fired the shot as his life was in danger."
Ex-colonial governor's HK comments blasted,"A statement from a person identified as the principal official in the Office of the Commissioner of the Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region rebuffed former British governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten and urged him to respect the facts, know his place and stop telling blatant lies and putting on ridiculous performances.

 ""Time keeps moving on, but Mr Patten has stood pat, indulging in the faded glory of colonialism and refusing to face the reality that it has been 22 years since Hong Kong's return to its motherland,"" the unnamed official said in the statement on Saturday.

 Responding to Patten's remarks about Hong Kong in an earlier media report, the official said that it is shameless and absurd for Patten, who was not democratically elected, to picture himself as a ""guardian"" of human rights and freedoms.

 In a signed article published in the Financial Times on Friday, Patten wrote that ""the UK has every right to discuss with China what is happening in its former colony"", and ""freedom of speech has been whittled away"" in Hong Kong.

 The statement said Hong Kong people didn't enjoy any freedom or democracy during the 150 years it was under British colonial rule. Instead, ""Hong Kong people, once 'second-class citizens' during the colonial period, have stood up as their own masters with unprecedented democratic rights and freedoms in accordance with law,"" it said.

 Hong Kong now has an economy twice the size that of 1997 and has ranked as the world's most free economy for more than 20 consecutive years. Hong Kong ranked 16th for its rule of law in 2018, up from below 60th in 1996 under British rule, it said. ""These are facts that not even Mr Patten can deny,"" the statement concluded.

 On July 1, Hong Kong and the international community witnessed violent protests against an extradition bill, including protesters storming and vandalizing the building of the city's legislature. Patten, however, ""turned a blind eye to the violent crime and tried every means to justify the offenders"", the statement said.

 ""Such condoning of violence is an assault on the rule of law in Hong Kong, in total disregard of the rights and security of the vast majority of Hong Kong residents. It shows not the least sense of justice or morality,"" the statement said. It also reiterated that the Sino-British Joint Declaration, often cited by Patten to pressure the Hong Kong SAR and China, became null when Hong Kong returned to the motherland on July 1, 1997.

 The official criticized Patten, the last governor of Hong Kong, for ""overreaching himself and putting up desperate attempts to cause trouble for the Hong Kong SAR and China at large"" for years.

 On Sunday afternoon, a group of demonstrators opposed to the now-suspended extradition bill launched a protest march from Tsim Sha Tsui to the West Kowloon high-speed rail station.

 The bill, which was intended to plug legal loopholes in Hong Kong's handling of fugitives, was suspended by the government on June 15. In the weeks since, the city has seen its people divided over the issue, as well as protests that frequently involved violence.

 The police have arrested a number of people in connection with the violence and other unlawful acts carried out during recent protests.

 Secretary for Justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah said on Sunday in a blog post that comments and opinions expressed in the community would not affect the Department of Justice in discharging its prosecutorial duties."
McConnell is just standing with those who will further his anti-China agenda,"Recently, US Senator Mitch McConnell published a commentary in the Wall Street Journal titled “We Stand with Hong Kong,” blaming Beijing for the chaos that has rocked the city for three months. The op-ed comes on the heels of a host of public statements by US lawmakers, demonstrating that Hong Kong has become a tool in their game against China.

 In the article, McConnell said the turmoil is the result of Beijing’s systematic ratcheting up of its domestic oppression and its pursuit of hegemony abroad. He also wrote that every trading nation and democracy that values individual liberty and privacy has a stake here, saying their choice is not between the US and China but between a free, fair international system and the internal oppression, surveillance, and modern vassal system China seeks to impose.

 By casting the Hong Kong problem as a frontline in a fight between a US-led world order and a rising China, US senators like McConnell have made it clear that they see the unrest in Hong Kong as an opportunity to stir up anti-China sentiment and spread the wings of Western-style democracy in Asia.

 At a regular press conference on March 23, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang blamed such US lawmakers for sending wrong signals. He pointed out that instead of condemning the increasing levels of violence by radical protesters in Hong Kong, they have criticized the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for trying to stop the violence and restore order in the city.

 Geng also referenced Abraham Lincoln, the 16th US President, who is often credited with saying, “You can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time,” to make a point about deception. He said the US lawmakers should heed these words of wisdom and stop smearing China and instigating Hong Kong’s radical protesters.

 Anti-China sentiment in Washington is rising, as some see China’s rise as a threat to US hegemony, but it is hypocrisy at its worst to blame Beijing for the chaos while interfering in Hong Kong affairs under the guise of democracy. Along with containment, democracy promotion is a guiding principle of US foreign policy—part of a larger playbook to remake the world in the image of America, and the comments from US lawmakers about Hong Kong suggest that Washington is intent on remaking China in its image.

 The chaos in Hong Kong has only escalated, with protesters resorting to acts that are more radical. Just this weekend, radical protesters hurled bricks and petrol bombs at police officers and brutally assaulted them. The scene became so dangerous that a Hong Kong police officer fired a warning shot into the air. However, rather than condemn the violence, the US side has chosen to incite chaos with a host of wrong signals to radical protesters.

 There is no denying the fact that Hong Kong is part of China. As a part of China, Hong Kong affairs are China’s internal affairs. While there are problems in Hong Kong to resolve, the United States has no business sticking its nose into Hong Kong affairs and trying to steer the protests in an anti-Beijing direction. US lawmakers like McConnell say they stand with Hong Kong, but they just stand with those who will further their anti-China agenda."
Commentary: EU should quit meddling in China's internal affairs,"BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Parliament (EP) approved Thursday a motion in support of the protests in Hong Kong, a move that does nothing useful for the bilateral relationship between the European Union (EU) and China.

 By calling on the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to withdraw its extradition bill and drop all charges against the protesters, the EP has interfered in China's domestic affairs, arrogantly pointing its finger at the law-based governance of the HKSAR government.

 The motion ignores how the people of Hong Kong have strongly condemned the violence and flooded the city's streets in pro-police rallies. It turns a blind eye to the appalling violence committed by the rioters, who have hurt not only civilians but also police personnel with sharpened iron poles, bricks, wooden planks and rail barriers.

 The motion also ignored one simple fact: since the return of Hong Kong to the motherland in 1997, China's central government in strict accordance with the constitution and the Basic Law has faithfully implemented the principle of ""one country, two systems."" Furthermore, China's central government has abided by the principle of ""Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong"" while ensuring a high degree of autonomy for the HKSAR.

 The legislative branch of the EU elected a new leadership early this month, as did other EU institutions. The EU bodies, under new leaderships, should maintain the momentum of developing China-EU relations.

 China regards the EU as a strategic partner of cooperation and strives for building a partnership based on peace and growth.

 During a visit to Europe in March, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China and Europe share far more in common than their differences would suggest, urging both sides to take the lead in upholding peace, development and win-win cooperation.

 China has long been a firm supporter of European integration, in expectation of the bloc's lasting solidarity, stability, openness and prosperity. The EU needs to meet China halfway.

 On trade, the EU is China's largest trading partner while the Asian country is the bloc's second largest trading partner. In addition, China-EU cooperation has yielded impeccable results in a wide range of areas, including finance, research and innovation, and people-to-people exchanges.

 The two sides also share the belief of upholding multilateralism, reforming global governance and supporting each other on various issues including climate change.

 The EU, especially the new EP leadership, should quit its prejudices and work to maintain sound relations with China. Only then can China and the EU embrace a brighter future together."
HK society urged to ditch political tangle,"BEIJING, July 29 -- A spokesperson on Monday urged Hong Kong society to walk clear from the political tangle as early as possible and focus on developing the economy and improving people's livelihoods.

 Yang Guang, spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks on the recent protests and violent incidents in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) at a press conference in Beijing.

 Noting that development is the right path for solving problems in Hong Kong, the spokesperson stressed that if the disorder persists, the entire society of Hong Kong will have to ""cover the cost.""

 Yang said the HKSAR government and the whole society should take more effective measures in promoting economic development and improving people's livelihoods, especially in helping young people tackle difficulties in housing, education, employment and starting businesses.

 The central government is willing to make joint efforts with the HKSAR government and society in creating a sound environment for the development of the young people, the spokesperson said."
Protesters paralyze airport as HKSAR chief executive appeals for end to violence,"Tourists are stranded due to chaos caused by protesters at Hong Kong International Airport in Hong Kong, south China, Aug. 12, 2019. (Xinhua/Lui Siu Wai)

 All check-in services for departure flights were suspended starting at 4:30 p.m., the Airport Authority Hong Kong said in a statement after protesters occupied the airport terminal and prevented passengers from departing.

 HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the most urgent task now is to stop violence and safeguard the rule of law to prevent Hong Kong from sinking into ""an abyss where it will be smashed to pieces.""

 HONG KONG, Aug. 13 (Xinhua) -- Protesters created chaos at the Hong Kong International Airport for the second day on Tuesday, causing cancellations of most outbound flights at one of the busiest airports in the world.

 All check-in services for departure flights were suspended starting at 4:30 p.m., the Airport Authority Hong Kong said in a statement after protesters occupied the airport terminal and prevented passengers from departing.

 Footage aired by a local broadcaster showed some protesters grab passengers' arms, preventing them from passing through checkpoints.

 As of 3 p.m., 188 arriving and 182 departing flights scheduled on Tuesday had been canceled due to the protests, according to the airport authority.

 It was the second day of chaos at the airport caused by protests, leaving many stranded passengers visibly annoyed.

 ""Unfortunately with the chaos, we are stuck here in the airport,"" said a Filipino passenger named Bennet. ""No food and no drinks at all. Most of the restaurants are closed.""

 A passenger from the Chinese mainland said she considered flying from Shenzhen instead. ""I don't know when this will end,"" she said.

 ""They (protesters) are damaging Hong Kong's business environment and image,"" said the passenger surnamed Gao. ""I love Hong Kong, but I feel sorry for those young people who have been incited and used.""

 A HEAVY PRICE

 Frank Chan Fan, secretary for transport and housing of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government, said paralyzing the airport will make Hong Kong ""pay a heavy price.""

 ""Amid fierce regional competition, it is very easy to destroy years of achievements the airport has accomplished, but rebuilding them would be very hard,"" Chan said.

 In 2018, the Hong Kong airport handled an average of 200,000 travelers each day, while trade via air accounted for nearly half of Hong Kong's total trade volume.

 In a joint statement on Tuesday, seven labor unions in the aviation industry of Hong Kong condemned the unpermitted demonstrations that have stained the international reputation of Hong Kong.

 The unions urged the protesters to stop all unlawful demonstrations and refrain from ""gambling at the expense of Hong Kong's economic pillar.""

 On Tuesday, HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the most urgent task now is to stop violence and safeguard the rule of law to prevent Hong Kong from sinking into ""an abyss where it will be smashed to pieces.""

 Lam said some people, in the name of freedom or justice, have been committing vandalism and damaging the rule of law, throwing Hong Kong into a state of panic.

 If violence persists, it will take a long time to restore the openness, freedom, inclusiveness and economic stability in Hong Kong, and the stable lives of seven million residents can not continue, Lam said.

 RETAIL, TOURISM BADLY HIT

 Weeks of protests and violent incidents have dented Hong Kong's retail, catering and tourism sectors, a key part of the local economy.

 Business owners and industry insiders expressed growing worries as endless and ever-escalating violence continued to weigh on consumption and deter potential tourists.

 ""Business has been really bad recently. Sometimes, we don't receive a single guest in hours,"" said Ben Pui, a lobby manager of a hotel located in Sai Wan on Hong Kong Island.

 The occupancy rate for Pui's hotel is currently struggling to reach 70 percent, compared with over 90 percent in past summers, despite a drop of room price to 300 HK dollars (38.2 U.S. dollars) from 600.

 Visitor arrivals to Hong Kong totaled around 5.14 million in June, dropping by about 770,000 from the figure in May, according to Hong Kong Tourism Board.

 Since June, the tourism sector has been hit hard by multiple violent protests, and safety concerns mounted, said Yiu Si-wing, a lawmaker and tourism industry insider, adding that immediate recovery is not likely even if violence ceases soon.

 The HKSAR government said earlier this month that the value of total retail sales in June 2019 decreased by 6.7 percent compared with the same month in 2018, as local consumer sentiment turned more cautious and growth in visitor arrivals moderated.

 ""Every time I heard about a possible protest in the neighborhood, I just closed my shop and took a day off,"" said a Hong Kong resident surnamed Lau, who runs a small clothing shop in the Causeway Bay shopping district.

 ""With the chaos, people don't want to hang out and buy things. How can I make money?"" Lau said."
Rubio’s absurdity knows no bounds,"On July 25, a spokesperson for the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) hit back at America’s most radical anti-China politician Marco Rubio. Rubio alleged that “Communist Party of China used organized crime groups to attack protesters in Hong Kong” and that “they are violating everything they agreed in Hong Kong handover.” The spokesperson denounced the remarks of the US senator on Hong Kong as “absolute nonsense.”

 In fact, Rubio is known to stir up trouble. In February, Rubio threatened Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro with a graphic picture of the brutal murder of late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi as part of a social media campaign to try to incite a civil war. It was a shocking look into the mind of a man who will go to extreme lengths to promote his personal agenda in other countries. Twitter users blasted the US senator as a “psychopath,” “sick and twisted,” and “manic warmonger.”

 Rubio has a record of maliciously attacking China and confusing right and wrong without any moral sense, as the spokesperson said. And this is exactly what he is doing when he took to social media to provoke the relationship between Hong Kong and the central government of China, once again revealing his malicious intentions.

 “To some American politicians, only violence in their countries counts as violence, while violence in other countries and regions is a matter of human rights and freedom; only those who attack the police and endanger social order in their countries are rioters, while those damaging public property, storming government institutions and even assaulting the police elsewhere are 'human rights and freedom fighters,” the spokesperson said.

 This shows that there is a double-standard when it comes to China. In any civilized society, violence is unacceptable and should be condemned.

 For example, some American politicians have labeled Antifa—a political protest movement opposed to extreme right-wing ideology—as domestic terrorists. After the group took to the streets of Portland, Oregon, disorder broke out. In response, Bill Cassidy and Ted Cruz introduced a resolution condemning the violent acts conducted by Antifa and calling for the designation of the group as a domestic terrorist organization. Cruz called Antifa “a terrorist organization composed of hateful, intolerant radicals who pursue their extreme agenda through aggressive violence.”

 Would they still label Antifa as terrorists if they were protesting in Hong Kong? They are more likely than not to fan the flames of violence, just like Rubio did when he threatened Maduro with Gaddafi’s gruesome fate. This is hypocrisy and absurdity at its finest.

 Since Hong Kong’s return to China, the central government has been committed to the principles of “one country, two systems,” “Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong,” and a high degree of autonomy in the special administrative region. As a result, the spokesperson said, Hong Kong has maintained its prosperity and stability, and its people now enjoy unprecedentedly extensive rights and freedoms in accordance with law.

 No matter what garbage comes out of Rubio’s mouth, it is impossible to change these facts."
President voices trust in HK chief executive,"President Xi Jinping on Monday meets with Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuetngor on the sidelines of the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai. JU PENG / XINHUA

 President Xi Jinping on Monday met with Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor as she attended the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai.

 After hearing Lam's report on the recent situation in Hong Kong, Xi, noting that the disturbances in Hong Kong have lasted five months, said Lam has led the SAR government to fully discharge its duties, strive to stabilize the situation and improve the social atmosphere, and has done a lot of hard work.

 Xi voiced the central government's high degree of trust in Lam and full acknowledgment of the work of her and her governance team.

 Ending violence and chaos and restoring order remain the most important tasks for Hong Kong at present, he said.

 Xi demanded unswerving efforts to stop and punish violent activities in accordance with the law to safeguard the well-being of the general public in Hong Kong.

 Meanwhile, effective efforts should be made in work including engaging in dialogue with all sectors of society and improving people's livelihoods, Xi said.

 He expressed his hope that people from all walks of life in Hong Kong fully and faithfully implement the principle of ""one country, two systems"" and the HKSAR Basic Law, and make concerted efforts to safeguard Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.

 Briefing the media on the sidelines of the expo, Lam expressed her will to end violence in Hong Kong after Xi reaffirmed support for her.

 Lam vowed that she and her administration will continue to work in strict accordance with the ""one country two systems"" principle, uphold the rule of law and try to put an end to the violence.

 Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said Xi's remarks are ""a shot in the arm"" for the Hong Kong government to end violence and restore social order. He made the remarks before the weekly Executive Council meeting on Tuesday as acting CE during Lam's visit on the mainland.

 Describing the meeting as ""a vote of confidence"", Cheung said it showed that Xi attached high importance to Hong Kong. ""All this is particularly reassuring to us,"" he said.

 Cheung added that the meeting helped the SAR government find a clear direction for accomplishing future tasks such as strengthening communication with the public and addressing deep-seated social problems.

 The official noted that a second open community dialogue would be held after the District Council elections. In the meantime, the government will continue to hold closed-door focus group meetings to better gauge public opinion, he said.

 He also noted the government will soon roll out another set of relief measures for the troubled catering, retail and logistics sectors to help them endure the technical recession the city is facing.

 The recognition from the central government was also hailed by local political and business leaders as timely support for the embattled SAR government.

 Veteran politician Tam Yiu-chung, Hong Kong's deputy to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said Xi's recognition of Lam would help stabilize the situation as it crushed rumors about a reshuffling of the SAR leadership.

 A recent report by The Financial Times claimed that Beijing is seeking to replace Lam by March. Speculation has also surfaced recently that some SAR officials and Executive Council members providing advice to Lam may also be replaced.

 Local political commentator Lau Siu-kai said Xi's remarks will help enhance the credibility of the embattled SAR government and create favorable conditions for its future work.

 Amid the ongoing anti-government protests, the government has met with unprecedented challenges brought by local rioters, opposition camps and external forces, said Lau, who is also vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies.

 The support from the central authorities is much-needed for the SAR government to end violence and restore social order, a challenging task during the severe time, Lau said.

 David Wong Yau-kar, a Hong Kong deputy to the National People's Congress, said Xi's remarks reflected that the central government wants sound political wisdom from Lam in handling the crisis in Hong Kong.

 In effectively stopping violence and restoring law and order, the SAR government needs to be tough enough, and actively mobilize manpower from functional departments, Wong said.

 But in terms of dialogue with the community, and improving the city's deep-rooted livelihood issues, it requires prolonged efforts with a mild approach, he added."
Commissioner's office of Chinese foreign ministry in HK to Chris Patten: UK is pioneer of anti-mask law,"HONG KONG, Oct. 7 -- Former governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten's recent remarks on the anti-mask regulation of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) have totally ignored the call in Hong Kong for stopping violence and the fact that the UK is a pioneer in banning masks, Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong SAR said Monday.

 Patten's remarks on Hong Kong SAR's enactment of the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation ""have totally ignored the call of the majority of Hong Kong citizens for stopping violence and the chaos, and the fact that the UK is a pioneer in banning masks,"" said a spokesperson of the commissioner's office.

 ""We strongly condemn the remarks, which are full of hypocrisy, bigotry and ruthlessness and have fully exposed Chris Patten's true color,"" the spokesperson said.

 The spokesperson said that the SAR government's enactment of the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation is completely legal, reasonable, just and necessary.

 Over the past four months, masked rioters in Hong Kong have gone on rampage, committed vandalism and arson, and assaulted the police and innocent citizens, posing a grave threat to public security and the rule of law. The Hong Kong public, who have suffered unspeakably, have called for immediately stopping violence, ending the chaos and restoring order, and have shown firm support for the SAR Government in passing the regulation, the spokesperson pointed out.

 ""By distorting the truth and fabricating excuses in total disregard of the mainstream public opinion and the serious threat to civilian safety, Chris Patten attempts to justify the rioters and impede the SAR government's efforts to stop violence. Such intention is simply despicable,"" said the spokesperson.

 The spokesperson pointed out that the enactment of the regulation is in line with international common practices. Similar laws and regulations have long been present in Western countries including France, Germany, Canada, Spain and Austria and in many states of the United States.

 As early as in 1723, Britain passed the Black Act criminalizing having one's faces blackened or being otherwise disguised, which was not repealed until 1823. Later, Britain again banned the covering of the face in response to the protests and riots in 2011, the spokesperson said.

 ""Is that also 'absolutely madness' according to Chris Patten's criteria, we wonder? Such outright double standards and shameless hypocrisy have been seen through by the entire world and will only meet with contempt.""

 The spokesperson emphasized that Hong Kong is part of China and its affairs are completely China's internal affairs. ""We firmly support the SAR government in taking all necessary measures in accordance with law to stop violence, end the chaos and restore order.""

 ""We again urge Chris Patten and his ilk to remove their black hand from Hong Kong affairs, give up their evil attempts to devastate the city, and stop such 'doomsday madness'."""
Commentary: Western double standards exposed as Catalonia becomes new Hong Kong,"Catalonia in Spain recently suffered violent protests like those in Hong Kong. We still remember that certain people in the West called the large demonstrations in Hong Kong ""a beautiful sight to behold."" Suppose these people support the Catalonia protestors, the result will be an unstable society; and if they don’t, they are applying double standards to the Hong Kong and Catalonia problems.

 Some Western countries have dug a hole and fallen into it themselves. They might be able to defend themselves, but they won't fool the world.

 From London to Catalonia, protests have led a counter charge to certain Western countries which preach democracy and freedom. Such irony is a slap in the face of certain countries that are biased against China and Hong Kong.

 We could interpret such a scenario with the political decay theory proposed by US scholar Samuel P. Huntington. If the governments of Western countries fail to run their countries effectively in the context of the information revolution and if their incompetence is not properly improved, we may see the world experience a great change at accelerated speeds unseen in a century.

 The root cause of such contradictions is the economy. Steve Bannon, Trump's 2016 campaign chairman, claimed that China’s export surplus hurt workers in the US and the UK.

 Bannon is partly right as the industrial worker stratum in developed countries collapsed in the course of globalization. But he should also understand that it is the profit chasers in Wall Street that should take responsibility, not China. They worship money more than they worship God, not to mention their devotion to US national interests.

 These Western countries know about their problems, but they chose to solve them in a way that’s to no avail: fabricating an enemy and transferring their domestic contradictions onto other countries.

 Such tricks as provocative propaganda and subversive infiltration yielded some outcomes at the beginning. But they will sooner or later stir a counter charge if they get out of control.

 The paradox of the West in dealing with Catalonia and Hong Kong problems has demonstrated the fact it is impossible to straighten out the contradictions in a lie without hurting oneself.

 There is no necessity for China and other countries to join the boring “who’s worse?” game initiated by the West. They have more worthwhile things to do, such as improving national governance and perfecting their governance system, working for the well-being of the people and building a common community of shared future for mankind.

"AmCham HK fears U.S. businesses affected by violence, HK-related bill","HONG KONG, Oct. 15 -- The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (AmCham HK) has found that many U.S. businesses have been affected by Hong Kong's prolonged protests and violence, and feared that a Hong Kong-related bill at the U.S. Congress could have counter-productive consequences on U.S. business.

 In its latest temperature-testing survey conducted on Oct. 8-13 and published Monday, AmCham HK found that 61 percent of the surveyed member companies have seen their business affected by the months of protests and violence in Hong Kong to a great or medium extent, higher than the result of 43.8 percent of a previous survey in July.

 The survey was received by about 1,200 AmCham HK members and responded by 124 of them. Among them, 46 percent said they are pessimistic about Hong Kong's long-term prospects, up from 34 percent in July poll.

 Despite the above findings, 76 percent of the respondents do not think their companies are considering moving capital, assets or business operations from Hong Kong.

 ""The fact that a majority of companies surveyed say they will not leave the city highlights the importance of Hong Kong as a strategic and irreplaceable business hub for Asia,"" said AmCham President Tara Joseph.

 ""This survey should sound as an alarm bell for all who value Hong Kong as a vibrant business hub with rule of law and free flow of information,"" she said. ""It's crucial now to see an end to violence.""

 Replying to Xinhua inquiry on Tuesday, AmCham HK referred to an earlier statement that also called for support for Hong Kong's special status and expressed ""reservations"" about certain provisions of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act being discussed at the U.S. Congress.

 ""AmCham has reservations about certain provisions of the pending U.S. legislation that we fear could have unintended, counter-productive consequences, including on American business and its ability to continue exercising a strong positive influence in favor of Hong Kong's traditional core values,"" said the statement.

 AmCham HK said it has concerns about the sections addressing export controls and sanctions in particular, elaborating that the export control reporting mechanism can chill cooperation and open dialogue between the United States and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and risks a lose-lose for the United States.

 Describing economic sanctions and visa bans as ""a more controversial tool of U.S. foreign policy,"" it said their use with respect to Hong Kong could harm Hong Kong's reputation as an international financial center with rule of law and a place where American businesses can openly compete on a level playing field.

 ""The U.S. should invest in Hong Kong's autonomy and rule of law as opposed to taking steps that threaten to undermine it,"" the chamber of commerce said, adding that U.S. policy toward Hong Kong ""should be driven first and foremost by a spirit of cooperation, nourishment, and support for this singular and irreplaceable place."""
Educators call for HK education system reform,"Wong Kam-leung (right), chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers, poses for a photo with his colleague as HKFEW calls for reform on Hong Kong's education system. Photo: Lu Wenao/GT

 As Hong Kong Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung Kin-chung on Thursday announced that among the 2,379 people arrested in the months-long protests, 750 people were under 18 years old, including 104 under 16, people are questioning Hong Kong's education system.

 The past summer vacation witnessed thousands of students taking to the streets of Hong Kong to join anti-government rallies, with some engaged in violence and riots. Hong Kong police has said that the youngest person arrested was 12.

 Wong Kam-leung, chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers (HKFEW), said those manipulating students planned to use the summer vacation to implement their agenda.

 ""Students were easily exploited, tempted and encouraged to participate in demonstrations and even illegal actions while their parents were working,"" Wong told the Global Times in a recent interview. ""We sternly condemn those who have ulterior motives, and their actions are very shameful.""

 Some organizations, including the Hong Kong Professional Teachers Union, encouraged students to strike in September. It ultimately turned out to be a failed plot, as nearly 90 percent of schools did not see any strikes, according to the HKFEW. But the move has put more pressure on schools.

 ""We have been warning against bringing political confrontations into the schools,"" Wong told the Global Times. ""It's a pity that some people brought their political goals to schools during the summer vacation.""

 Incidents have shown that Hong Kong education faces unprecedented challenges, and Wong said those challenges also made schools the victims.

 ""Educators should uphold the profession to help the next generation get through this difficult time,"" Wong said.

 Although a large number of teachers are working hard to restore campus order, the teaching profession in Hong Kong has been tainted, highlighted by Tai Kin-fai, the assistant principal of the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Churches Union Logos Academy and Lai Tak-chung, who works at Sacred Heart Canossian College, who lashed out at the police and their relatives with malicious words on social media.

 ""Society has high expectations for the teachers, but those malicious moves caused great harm to the education sector, as some no longer have confidence in that sector,"" Wong warned, calling on Hong Kong's Education Bureau to do more to help ease the situation.

 ""On one hand, it should better guide schools through this period; on the other hand, it should punish teachers who violated the law or ethics,"" Wong said.

 Wong believes students participate in anti-government protests because of an insufficient understanding and recognition of the motherland.

 ""Teachers of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have the responsibility and obligation to educate the next generation to identify with the country,"" Wong said, suggesting that the ""quasi-teachers"" who study at the Hong Kong University of Education should go to the mainland to have a deeper understanding of the country, and convey their findings to the students.

 ""We educators should let the children understand that Hong Kong is their home. It's not easy to build a home but very easy to destroy it,"" Wong noted."
Protest leader has no right to beg for foreign interference in Hong Kong: spokesperson,"A Chinese spokesperson on Monday condemned Joshua Wong Chi-fung, leader of a Hong Kong political group advocating ""independence"", for seeking foreign interference in Hong Kong.

 The 22-year-old urged US President Donald Trump to include human rights provisions in any trade deal with China.

 “As a Chinese, Wong sought foreign interference in China’s internal affairs. The spokesperson of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council has pointed out the nature of such people. I think Wong doesn’t have any say in the relationship between China and the US,” said Hua Chunying, spokesperson of Chinese Foreign Ministry.

 “China has always been consistent and clear on matters related to Hong Kong and the trade negotiations between China and the US,” Hua added. “I just want to reiterate that Hong Kong affairs are purely China’s internal affairs, and no foreign government, organization or individual has the right to interfere. Any words, acts or plots to promote oneself by pulling in foreign forces and to split the country are doomed to failure. ”

 Earlier this month, a spokesperson for Beijing’s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office warned that a few protesters are acting for foreign powers confronting the central government, attempting to jeopardize the ""one country, two systems"" principle.

 Wong is among the leading separatists in the ongoing Hong Kong protest over the now-withdrawn extradition bill. On Aug. 30, Wong was arrested by Hong Kong police on charges of organizing unauthorized rallies, but was granted bail. He was detained again at the Hong Kong airport on Sep. 8 for breaching bail conditions. On Sep. 9, Wong met with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, which China expressed strong dissatisfaction with and firm opposition to."
Chinese Ambassador calls for Western media to report Hong Kong in a just manner,"Chinese Ambassador to the U.K. Liu Xiaoming (Photo/fmprc.gov.cn)

 Reiterating that the Central Government has enough solutions and enough power within the limits of the Basic Law to quell any unrest, Chinese Ambassador to the U.K., Liu Xiaoming, called for media from home and abroad to report the Hong Kong issue in a just and objective manner during a press conference at the Chinese Embassy on Thursday.

 During the conference, Liu provided materials from different sources on the current situation in Hong Kong, with a short video clip showing protesters attack Hong Kong police and the public’s negative opinions towards these acts of violence, which are heavily neglected by the Western media. Following is the full text of the opening remarks given by the Ambassador:

 Opening Remarks by H.E. Ambassador Liu Xiaoming at the Press Conference at the Chinese Embassy

 Chinese Embassy, 15 August 2019

 Ladies and Gentlemen:

 Good morning! Welcome to the Chinese Embassy.

 On 3 July, I held a press conference here to answer questions about the amendments to Hong Kong’s extradition laws and to explain China’s position. For more than a month since then, the opposition in Hong Kong and some radical forces have continued to use their opposition to the amendments as an excuse for various types of radical street protests. The violence involved has escalated and the damage to the society has expanded. The movement has gone way beyond free assembly and peaceful protests. It is posing a severe challenge to law and order in Hong Kong, threatening the safety of life and property of the Hong Kong people, undermining the prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and challenging the principled bottom line of “One Country, Two Systems”. As a result, Hong Kong now faces the gravest situation since its handover.

 A handful of extreme radicals have been undermining rule of law, social order and “One Country, Two Systems” in Hong Kong. But they have taken cover under the so-called “pro-democracy movement” to hide their real intention and to whitewash their disruptive actions. This “neo-extremism” is both highly deceptive and destructive. The “neo-extremists” stormed the Legislative Council Complex, attacked the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government in Hong Kong, assaulted police officers and brought Hong Kong airport to a standstill by illegal assembly. Their moves are severe and violent offences, and already show signs of terrorism. The Central Government of China would never allow a few violent offenders to drag Hong Kong down a dangerous abyss. We would never allow anyone to harm the rule of law and sound development in Hong Kong. We would never allow anyone to undermine “One Country, Two Systems” at any excuse. Should the situation in Hong Kong deteriorate further into unrests uncontrollable for the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), the Central Government would not sit on its hands and watch. We have enough solutions and enough power within the limit of the Basic Law to quell any unrest swiftly.

 This is a critical moment for Hong Kong. How will this end? This question is in the mind of all those who care about the future of Hong Kong. It is also hitting headlines and making “cover stories” in British media. Our answer to this question is firm and clear: We hope this will end in an orderly way. In the meantime, we are fully prepared for the worst. So how will this end in an orderly way? I think the following four points are extremely important.

 First, the priority now is to support the SAR Government in ending violence and restoring order. I hope that Hong Kong people, especially the young people who have been led astray, would have a clear understanding of the current situation in Hong Kong and cherish the sound development of Hong Kong after the handover, which has not come by easily. I hope they will keep the big picture in mind, rally behind the Chief Executive and the SAR Government, uphold rule of law and justice in Hong Kong, and safeguard national unification as well as Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability. Hong Kong people from all walks of life must refuse to be used or coerced by the radical forces. They should say “no” to all violence and lawlessness. They should support the SAR Government in governing Hong Kong in accordance with law, and support the Hong Kong police in strict and rigorous enforcement.

 Second, the violent offenders must be brought to justice in accordance with law. It is the basic requirement of the rule of law that all laws must be observed and all offenders must be held accountable. The violent and lawless perpetrators must be brought to justice no matter who they are or however hard they try to whitewash their actions. If anyone in this country questions this point, let me ask them this: Would the UK allow extremists to storm the Palace of Westminster or damage its facilities, and get away with it? Would the UK give permission for attacking police officers with lethal weapons or set fire to the police station without any punishment? Would the UK allow so-called pro-democracy rioters to occupy the airport, obstruct traffic, disturb social order or threaten the safety of people’s life and property? Aren’t all these regarded as crimes in the UK?

 Indulging lawlessness is tantamount to blaspheming against justice. Conniving in violence is tantamount to trampling on the rule of law. No country under the rule of law, no responsible government, would sit back and watch as such violence rages on. The Central Government of China firmly supports the SAR Government and Hong Kong police in strict, rigorous and decisive enforcement, so as to bring the offenders to justice as soon as possible and uphold the rule of law and social order in Hong Kong.

 Third, foreign forces must stop interfering in Hong Kong’s affairs. Evidence shows that the situation in Hong Kong would not have deteriorated so much had it not been for the interference and incitement of foreign forces. Some Western politicians and organisations have publicly or covertly given various types of support to the violent radicals, and tried to interfere in the judicial independence of Hong Kong and obstruct Hong Kong police from bringing the violent offenders to justice.

 I want to reiterate here that Hong Kong is part of China; no foreign country should interfere in Hong Kong affairs. We urge those foreign forces to respect China’s sovereignty and security, immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs, stop interfering in China’s internal affairs, and stop conniving in violent offences. They should not misjudge the situation and go down the wrong path. Otherwise, they will “lift the stone only to drop it on their own feet”.

 Fourth, the media must shoulder due social responsibilities. Since what happened in Hong Kong, I have to say, the Western media have failed to play a credible role. Instead of reporting the situation in a just and objective manner, they have confused right and wrong, given unbalanced account and misled the public. There has been massive coverage on so-called “right to peaceful protest” but few reports on the violent offences by the extreme radicals such as disruption of social order, attacks on police officers and injuries to bystanders. There has not been a word about the extensive public support for the SAR Government and for restoring law and order in Hong Kong. The lawless and violent offenders who undermine rule of law are whitewashed and named “pro-democracy activists” in media reports. But the legitimate law enforcement measures of the SAR Government and the police to uphold law and order and protect life and property of the people are labeled “repression”.

 Such selective reporting and distortion have resulted in the prevalence of wrong information and have misled the public, especially young people in Hong Kong. It is fair to say that Western media have inescapable responsibility for the current situation in Hong Kong!

 I sincerely hope that Western media would reflect on the social impact of their reporting, shoulder due social responsibilities, and report the situation in Hong Kong in a just and objective manner. I hope they would stop speaking up for the extreme violent offenders, refrain from pouring oil over the flame in Hong Kong, and foster a sound environment of public opinion so that law and order could be restored in Hong Kong.

 “Order fosters prosperity while unrest brews regress.” Given what is happening in Hong Kong, this ancient Chinese teaching cannot be more relevant.

 It is in the interests of both China and the international community including the UK to have a prosperous and stable Hong Kong, where over three hundred thousand British citizens live and work, and where three hundred British companies are doing business.

 I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life in the UK will have a clear understanding of the big picture, act in the interest of Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability, and refrain from saying or doing anything that interferes in Hong Kong’s affairs or undermines rule of law in Hong Kong. I am confident that with the support of the Central Government of China and under the leadership of the SAR Government and Chief Executive Carrie Lam, Hong Kong will bring violence to an end and restore law and order at an early date. Hong Kong, the “oriental pearl”, will once again shine brightly."
How the airport shutdown affects Hong Kong's economy in a day,"Passengers are stranded at the Hong Kong airport due to protests. (Photo/China News Service)

 The Hong Kong International Airport shut down due to protests on Monday, which severely impacted the economy and businesses, according to the authority.

 As the world's eighth busiest airport, the Hong Kong airport handles around 200,000 passengers every day. Over 230 flights were canceled on Monday due to a massive unauthorized sit-in at the airport. Five thousand protesters occupied the airport's departure and arrival halls. Crowds blocked roads to the airport and parking lots. The cancellations left tens of thousands of passengers stranded.

 Secretary for Transport &Housing Frank Chan said at a press conference on Monday, that the airport shutdown will cost Hong Kong a heavy price and the losses will be difficult to estimate. Trade and logistics are the pillar industries of Hong Kong, with a value of 370 million HK dollars (47 million U.S. dollars) per year.

 There are 73,000 Hong Kong residents employed at the airport and as many as 56,000 people are indirectly employed. Over 800,000 people's lives are closely related to the industrial chains that rely on the airport's operations, he added.

 How does the airport shutdown affect Hong Kong in a day?

 According to Dot Dot News, the paralysis of the Hong Kong airport has severely damaged the local economy, resulting in 206,000 less passengers, 13,863 tons of freight traffic losses, air cargo losses of 10.16 billion yuan (1.44 billion U.S. dollars) and revenue losses of 22.85 million yuan (3.24 million U.S. dollars), for the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) in a single day.

 Officials had urged the demonstrators to leave, so the airport could resume normal operations.

Commentary: Young people should stop risking their youth to create chaos in Hong Kong,"Young masked protesters in black have caused chaos in China’s Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) in recent weeks, changing the course of their lives while turning the protests against the extradition bill into a war against peace, law-based governance, and the whole of Hong Kong.

 Since June 9, more than 420 people have been arrested for illegal acts, leaving a mark of shame on their lives as well as local history.

 Used as cannon fodder by external forces, many of the protesters are young people and students, who have joined radicals in wrongdoings such as smashing public property, setting fires, spreading online rumors and participating in riots.

 As revealed in the Hong Kong Eastern Magistrates’ Courts on July 31, the 45 defendants taken before the courts for charges including rioting, assaulting police officers, and possession of offensive weapons, included a 13-year-old teenager, 20-year-old student, and a young couple who were engaged.

 No matter their age, these people must face the law due to their involvement in the violent clashes.

 Under the slogan of “breaking the law for justice” created by the opposition, these inexperienced protesters have been guided down a dangerous path where they can no longer tell right and wrong while chanting “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times”.

 As the line from an ancient Chinese poem goes, “One single slip brings eternal regret, and looking back, your whole life has passed away.” These young protesters, who have been cared for under the Hong Kong government and have reaped the benefits of the “one country, two systems” principle, but now attempt to destabilize the government and abandon the fundamental basis of the “one country” principle, have risked their youth to instigate violence, and changed their lives forever.

 The tune of youth should be brisk and full of joy, vitality and positive energy, while the song of life should be energetic, enterprising, and filled with determination and courage to strive for success.

 If the youth in Hong Kong have different opinions on issues concerning people’s livelihood, they can participate in political affairs, for which the Hong Kong government has offered platforms. If they want to secure a better life, they can’t just expect others to hand it over, but should learn from those who have succeeded through hard work.

 Those young protesters, who are in the golden period of their lives, should quit the impulsive rage and turn themselves into strivers and constructors, to leave no regrets in youth and embrace a wonderful future."
NBA exec's tweet over HK denounced,"Chinese basketball fans and organizations have taken a strong stance against Houston Rockets executive Daryl Morey's tweet backing protests in Hong Kong, which have grown increasingly violent.

 With only days before the NBA tips off an overseas preseason game tour in Shanghai, Morey, the Rockets' general manager, infuriated Chinese fans by tweeting support for the protests in Hong Kong, which have led to vandalism and serious damage. The tweet has sparked criticism beyond the sport's circles in China and triggered related organizations to cut ties with the franchise.

 During the Rockets' preseason trip to Japan on Friday, Morey tweeted an image that read ""Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong"".

 That was a slogan often shouted by rioters during months of protests in Hong Kong, which were sparked by opposition to a bill to amend the special administrative region's extradition law.

 Morey deleted the post after Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta distanced his organization from its GM's opinion, saying on Twitter that Morey doesn't speak for the Rockets. The team has had long-standing support in China for being the home of basketball Hall of Fame inductee Yao Ming from 2002 to 2011. Fertitta, however, later told ESPN that ""everything is fine with Daryl and me"".

 The Chinese Basketball Association, now chaired by Yao, swiftly responded on Sunday, announcing it had suspended any exchange or cooperation with the Rockets and expressing ""strong opposition"" to Morey's ""improper remarks regarding Hong Kong"". The Chinese league has also canceled its four preseason games against NBA development league teams, including Rockets' affiliate Rio Grande Valley Vipers, originally set for Oct 19 and 20 in Su-zhou, Jiangsu province.

 The Chinese Consulate General in Houston issued a statement saying it was ""deeply shocked"" by Morey's ""erroneous comments"" and expressed ""strong dissatisfaction"". The consulate also urged the Rockets to ""correct the error and take immediate concrete measures to eliminate the adverse impact"".

 Both China Central Television and the league's digital partner Tencent have announced a suspension of all broadcasting, livestreaming and news coverage of the Rockets, one of the most-followed NBA franchises in China, blocking it in its biggest overseas market.

 The NBA, preparing for its preseason games between Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets in Shanghai on Thursday and Shenzhen two days later, issued a statement on Monday through Mike Bass, its chief communications officer. Bass said the league understands Morey's views had ""deeply offended many"" in China, ""which is regrettable"".

 ""We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides,"" the statement said.

 On Monday, Morey tweeted trying to clarify his original post.

 ""I did not intend my tweet to cause offense,"" Morey said. ""I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives."" He also said, ""My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.""

 Rockets star guard James Harden apologized to Chinese fans after practice in Tokyo. ""We apologize. We love China,"" he said, standing alongside fellow All-Star teammate Russell Westbrook.

 Joseph Tsai, co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, who also owns the Nets, urged the league to learn its lesson on better understanding the history of China because repairing a hurt takes a long time.

 ""The one thing that is terribly misunderstood and often ignored is that 1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country's sovereignty over her homeland. This issue is nonnegotiable,"" the Chinese-Canadian entrepreneur wrote in an open letter posted on social media."
Hong Kong police warn protesters over carrying guns,"When someone draws a gun, there is no way for police to tell if it's real or not. ""The police would respond with force if a gun is pointed at anyone. That could have the most severe consequences,"" said Tse Chun-chung, chief superintendent of the Hong Kong Police Public Relations Branch.

 HONG KONG, Sept. 2 -- Carrying a gun, real or replica, could have dire consequences, a Hong Kong police spokesman warned protesters at a press conference on Monday.

 When someone draws a gun, there is no way for police to tell if it's real or not. ""The police would respond with force if a gun is pointed at anyone. That could have the most severe consequences,"" said Tse Chun-chung, chief superintendent of the Hong Kong Police Public Relations Branch.

 Carrying a gun is a criminal offense by itself, Tse said.

 Tse also denied allegations that some gun-carrying protesters were police personnel in disguise, saying the guns carried by protesters were not used by the police.

 ""These vicious slanders are despicable attempts to smear police officers who act in strict accordance with the law.""

 Multiple gun-carrying rioters had been captured in photos and video footages of recent violent protests in Hong Kong.

 Radicals threw more than 100 petrol bombs during the rioting on Saturday. The petrol bombs they used are becoming more powerful, causing longer and fiercer fires. ""Should a petrol bomb hit any resident, the consequences would be unthinkable,"" Mak Chin-ho, an assistant commissioner of police, told the press conference.

 Rioters also committed arson on Saturday, setting fire on Hennessy Road, a major thoroughfare on the Hong Kong Island. They kept adding fuel into the massive flames, causing at least two explosions, said Mak.

 Mak elaborated on Sunday's unlawful gathering where radical protesters disrupted transport to Hong Kong International Airport, forcing travellers to walk for miles to catch flights.

 Some protesters put iron bars and other obstacles on the tracks of the Airport Express, vandalized metro stations and blocked roads with mills barriers and luggage trolleys, Mak said.

 These protesters violated a court injunction against obstructing the proper use of the airport, and are liable for contempt of court, he said.

 ""These violent acts have no excuses. People who try to justify them are condoning violence,"" Mak said of the weekend's violent events.

 A total of 159 people were arrested for the massive violence in Hong Kong at the weekend, bringing the number of total arrests to 1,117 since protests began in early June."
US House bill on HK spurs strong protest from Beijing,"The United States House of Representatives' passage on Tuesday of the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 has sparked strong opposition from China, which said it will take countermeasures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests.

 ""If the relevant act were to become law, it would not only harm China's interests and China-US relations, but would also seriously damage US interests,"" said Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang in an online statement on Wednesday.

 Geng said that the US House ignored the facts and called black ""white"" by referring to serious crimes like arson, vandalism and assaults on police as issues of human rights and democracy.

 ""It fully revealed the double standards the US applies, the hypocrisy of some people in the US on human rights and democracy, and their evil intentions to undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and contain China's development,"" he said.

 He urged the US to clearly understand the situation, immediately stop advancing the act and stop meddling in Hong Kong's affairs, which are China's internal affairs.

 According to a statement issued on Wednesday by the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the passage of the bill by the US House openly encourages opposition and radical forces in Hong Kong, tests the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle and tramples upon international law and basic norms governing international relations.

 In the name of ""human rights and democracy"", some politicians in the US have attempted to undermine Hong Kong's role as an international finance, trade and shipping center, intimidated the just forces committed to stopping violence and ending chaos and provided shelter for violent extremists in Hong Kong, the statement said.

 The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council and the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress also issued condemnations of the act on Wednesday.

 Jon R. Taylor, chair of the University of Texas at San Antonio's department of political science and geography, told China Daily that the bill's consequences will likely be economic and cultural — with reduced opportunities for US investment and fewer US tourists.

 Taylor said a stable Hong Kong serves everyone's interests, and the US should be concerned that the increasing acts of violence will only lead to greater chaos.

 Mike Wong, vice-president of the San Francisco chapter of Veterans for Peace, said, ""We oppose any interference by elected US lawmakers to spend US tax dollars to support the illegal protesting in Hong Kong.""

 Wong's organization is leading a petition calling on US lawmakers to end interference in Hong Kong and pay attention to domestic problems such as homelessness, inadequate healthcare, housing and gun violence.

 Lawrence Ma Yan-kwok, chairman of the Hong Kong Legal Exchange Foundation, said, politically, Hong Kong provides an angle for the US to make up a story or excuse to condemn China or possibly seek international condemnation. In addition, Ma said the act is a way for the US government to divert public attention from its own political or policy deficiencies.

"Hong Kong people express support for police, calling for end to violence","Hong Kong people come out in large groups to support the police.

 Police are praised for professionalism, exercising restraint.

 Police have to deal with the enormous workload and emotional stress.

 HONG KONG, Aug. 10 -- Large groups of Hong Kong people visited several police stations in Hong Kong Saturday to express their firm support for and utmost respect to the police force.

 The scene stood in stark contrast to the chaotic and violent besieges of police stations by black-clad protesters on many nights over the past weeks.

 ""The police have been working really hard to safeguard social order. We came here to show our support,"" said a resident surnamed Chan, who visited Kwai Chung Police Station with his wife and son. The boy gave the police a hand-written card as a gift.

 ""I hope our children can learn to love peace and how to act as righteous people,"" Chan said. ""I also want to see society restore order and for there to be no more violence.""

 Local business leader Raymond Tsoi Chi-chung and his friends visited Central Police Station to express their support to the ""core force for protecting Hong Kong.""

 ""Recent violent incidents have reduced Hong Kong to an economic trough,"" Tsoi said. ""I hope Hong Kong people can focus on stabilizing the economy.""

 A police officer surnamed Lau has become an internet celebrity after a video went viral showing him confronting a crowd of protesters that had surrounded and attacked him.

 ""Hong Kong police are capable of coping with the mobsters, but it has torn my heart out either to hit them or not, as they are also Chinese,"" said Lau in a text message to a reporter, which drew immense online support for both his bravery and compassion.

 Carrie Lam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), on Friday visited Wong Tai Sin Police Station and dormitory quarters which had been attacked by radical protesters. Lam expressed thanks to the police personnel for their hard work to safeguard public security in Hong Kong.

 Lam also demanded renovation of the damaged buildings and heightened security in the dormitory quarters to give the peace back to the police families.

 PROFESSIONAL AND RESTRAINED

 Over the past two months, the Hong Kong police have been praised for showing professionalism and exercising restraint with the use of appropriate force to cope with violent protests.

 ""The approach the police adopted to dealing with violence is appropriate and balanced,"" said Chan Man Ki, founding president of the Small and Medium Law Firms Association of Hong Kong.

 Chan noted that far from rallying in a peaceful manner, the protesters have committed various offenses on the street, ranging from setting fires and throwing rocks and iron bars at the police to using offensive weapons, including explosives and homemade sharp objects, and besieging police stations.

 ""Facing violence of such degree, the police had every right to use appropriate force in an effort to end violence and protect public safety,"" said the legal expert.

 During the protests, police officers balanced the exercise of the right to freedom of speech for protesters and the right of other people to use the roads, a Hong Kong police officer told Xinhua.

 But police were mandated to take action when crimes were committed, said the officer, who declined to be named or disclose his rank.

 ""All the duties assigned to on-site police officers bear one characteristic: totally not proactive,"" he said.

 The officer said he saw in person one of his colleagues hit hard by a protester in the face.

 ""Part of his eyeball collapsed, which severely affected his eyesight. The injury may be permanent,"" he said.

 In response to the attacks, the police officer said his colleagues only resorted to the minimum use of force, such as using batons, tear gas and rubber rounds to disperse the crowd. ""We never used any lethal or deadly weapon against the protestors.""

 Elsie Leung, former secretary for justice of the HKSAR government, said various actions of the protesters have gone far beyond the realm of peaceful demonstrations -- ranging from storming and vandalizing the Legislative Council building and storming the institution of the central government in Hong Kong to paralyzing the transport network and assaulting the police force with bricks and petrol bombs.

 ""No one is above the law,"" she said, stressing that all the offenders should be brought to justice.

 ENORMOUS STRESS

 While battling to contain violence on the street, Hong Kong police officers had to face online assault, enduring all sorts of ridicule, humiliation and even threats.

 ""Many police officers are working more than 10 hours each day. They are also under tremendous mental stress for being assaulted by the radicals on social media,"" said Lam Chi-wai, chairman of the Junior Police Officers' Association of the Hong Kong Police Force.

 ""Even so, they are still working hard and sparing no effort to safeguard social stability,"" Lam said.

 ""We are facing a very serious situation of harassment on ourselves and family members, including kids,"" the unnamed police officer said. ""We were being attacked at every angle imaginable.""

 In some online chat groups, the radicals used abusive language against the police, drew caricatures and made videos to embarrass them and even revealed their personal information as a way of intimidation and threat.

 The enormous workload and stress on the police officers have taken a toll on their families members.

 During a recent rally held by police supporters, organizers played an audio clip featuring the worrying wife of a police officer.

 ""As the spouse of a police officer, I couldn't sleep many nights and don't know what to do,"" she said. ""But I feel obliged to speak out (against violence).""

 The audio clip ended with the sound of a little girl asking, ""Daddy, when are you coming home?""

 A Hong Kong resident surnamed Wong said many of her family members are working on the police force, and she felt heartsore to see them work day and night to keep public order.

 ""I hope the chaotic situation will subside and we can get back to our normal days as soon as possible,"" she said.

 The central authorities have also expressed unswerving support for the Hong Kong police.

 At a press conference in late July, Yang Guang, a spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, expressed understanding for the Hong Kong police force and their families for the tremendous stress they have been under.

 ""I'd like to take this opportunity to pay our high respect to the outstanding Hong Kong police officers who have been on the job, performed their duties, showed no fear, and endured a lot of humiliation,"" said Yang."
"No compromise with ""black sheep"" attempting to disrupt Hong Kong's social order: Tung Chee-hwa","HONG KONG, July 31 -- Tung Chee-hwa, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said here Wednesday that continuous turmoil and violence have severely damaged Hong Kong's rule of law and business environment, while also spoiling the confidence of the international community in Hong Kong and even the relationship between the mainland and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).

 At a lunch meeting organized by Our Hong Kong Foundation, a think tank he founded and chairs, Tung said that he believed there might be foreign forces behind the storm, given the scale of the protests and the savvy way they have been organized.

 Some foreign politicians, those anti-China elements in particular, have always harbored the ulterior motives of turning Hong Kong into a battle field to damage the relationship between the mainland and the SAR.

 ""Hong Kongers shall by no means be used by them,"" said the former chief executive of the SAR.

 He was confident that Hong Kong people will support the SAR government and the police in upholding the rule of law and taking decisive measures to restore social order.

 Tung said that there should be no compromise with those ""black sheep"" who disrupted Hong Kong's social order and attempted to tear Hong Kong apart.

 He urged the SAR government to swiftly tackle long-standing social issues and firmly uphold the principles of ""one country, two systems,"" ""Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong"" and a high degree of autonomy.

 Tung called on Hong Kong people to maintain confidence in Hong Kong and the whole country.

 Should we keep our confidence, inclusiveness and perseverance, Hong Kong people, with our wit and courage, can definitely ride the waves forward towards long-term stability and prosperity, said Tung."
"China lashes out at U.S. politicians for indulging, supporting anti-China disruptors in HK","BEIJING, Sept. 11 -- It is because of the indulgence and support by some U.S. politicians that the anti-China disruptors in Hong Kong are so reckless and unscrupulous, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Wednesday, demanding them stop condoning violent criminal offenses and stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs immediately.

 Some U.S. lawmakers submitted a bill to the Congress on Tuesday, calling for a suspension of sales of law enforcement equipment by U.S. companies to Hong Kong because they claimed that the police in Hong Kong have been widely criticized for what they did to the protesters. The law enforcement equipment includes tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets.

 In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said: ""I wonder if the U.S. Congressmen want to save these anti-riot equipment to deal with problems at home?""

 Speaking at a daily news briefing, Hua said that with regard to what happened in Hong Kong recently, the facts are clear.

 More and more mainstream international media have reported the true situation in Hong Kong with on-site coverage. ""For example, I just saw many high-resolution photos released by some Russian media, depicting demonstrators' weapons like umbrellas with knives and barbs hidden inside and gasoline bombs,"" she said.

 The reports said that some were carrying out terrorist and criminal activities under the cover of freedom and democracy, and the root cause of Hong Kong's violence and chaos lies with the malicious forces behind the scene. The so-called press freedom in Hong Kong is nearing absurdity, according to the reports.

 ""I would like to ask those U.S. lawmakers, when the violent extremists in Hong Kong brutally assaulted and injured the police and brought public facilities like the airport and subway to a standstill, where is the rule of law that you claim to advocate? When personal information of more than 1,000 police officers and their families were illegally exposed and they were targeted by crazy cyber bullying and threats, where are the human rights that you claim to champion? When people holding different views were chased, surrounded and beaten by black-clad demonstrators wearing masks, where is the freedom you claim to stand for?"" she said.

 Hua pointed out that some U.S. lawmakers are beautifying the violent criminal offenses as fight for human rights and freedom. At the same time, they are defaming Hong Kong police by calling their forbearance and restraint ""overuse of force.""

 ""There is no worse insult to freedom, democracy and human rights than this. It is open disregard for the mainstream public opinion of ending violence and chaos and restoring order, and it exposes their stark hypocrisy and double standard,"" she said.

 ""How did the U.S. police handle demonstrations? I believe many have vivid memories of the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement, the 2015 unrest in Baltimore, Maryland, as well as the recent demonstrations in Portland, Oregon. If the scenes in Hong Kong were to appear in the U.S., would the U.S. lawmakers still be so 'kind'? We are curious to see,"" she said.

 ""It is because of the indulgence and support by some U.S. politicians that the anti-China disruptors in Hong Kong are so reckless and unscrupulous,"" Hua said.

 She said that at a recent press conference on the situation in Hong Kong, Spokesperson Yang Guang of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office quoted Man Jiang Hong (a classical Chinese poem) composed by Chairman Mao Zedong in 1963.

 ""Today I would like to add the following two lines: The ants climbing up a locust tree congratulate themselves for running a great empire, but it won't be easy for them to shake the tree,"" Hua said.

 ""I will reiterate that Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs. No foreign government, organization or individual has any right to interfere. Those playing with fire on this issue will end up getting burned themselves,"" she said.

 ""We advise certain people in the U.S. to stop pretending to be asleep, stop condoning violent criminal offenses, and stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs immediately,"" she added."
HKSAR gov't strongly condemns protesters' storming of liaison office of China's central gov't,"HONG KONG, July 21 -- The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government on Sunday evening strongly condemned some radical protesters' storming of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR.

 A spokesperson for the HKSAR government said the liaison office is one of the offices set up by the central people's government in the HKSAR and has constitutional functions.

 The HKSAR government strongly condemns the protesters who blatantly challenged the national sovereignty by maliciously besieging and storming the liaison office's building as well as defacing the national emblem, the spokesperson said.

 ""The HKSAR government will deal with these acts in a serious manner in accordance with the law,"" the spokesperson said. The HKSAR government has always respected the public's expression of their aspirations peacefully, the spokesperson added.

 ""However, a series of incidents occurred recently, including the recurrence of illegal protests after peaceful processions, charging police cordon lines, besieging the Police Headquarters and blocking roads. The police also found illegal storage of dangerous goods and a large number of offensive weapons,"" the spokesperson said.

 The HKSAR government is concerned that a small number of radicals incited the masses in an organized manner, challenged the rule of law, and even stormed the liaison office of the central government.

 ""Such acts threaten the law and order in the SAR and 'one country, two systems'. It is totally unacceptable to the society,"" the spokesperson added."

 149 arrested as unlawful protests continue, violent acts spread over weekend in SAR

 Violence has escalated to a point that smacks of terrorism in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China's top authority on the city's affairs warned on Monday.

 In Beijing, Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said radical protesters have repeatedly attacked police officers in the past few days and have committed serious violent crimes. Such violence has begun to show the ""first signs of terrorism"", Yang said.

 Yang strongly condemned protesters who threw gasoline bombs at police officers on Sunday night.

 A very small number of rioters hurled the bombs at police officers at police stations in Cheung Sha Wan, Tsim Sha Tsui and Wan Chai on Sunday night. A police officer was hit by one such bomb thrown by a protester in Tsim Sha Tsui, causing burns to his legs.

 An initial diagnosis showed that the officer suffered second-degree burns on 10 percent of his left leg, and first-degree burns on 3 percent of his right leg.

 ""We express our strong indignation and condemnation of this sinister, reckless and serious crime,"" Yang said.

 Such violent acts have brutally violated the rule of law and social order in Hong Kong, seriously threatened the lives of Hong Kong citizens and challenged Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, he added. Such acts must be ""resolutely cracked down upon"" in accordance with the law, and the affairs office firmly supports Hong Kong police enforcing the law and bringing criminals to justice as soon as possible.

 The central government's liaison office in Hong Kong also issued a serious condemnation of violent lawbreakers.

 ""There is no place in the world that would tolerate such atrocious, violent acts. Hong Kong will slide into the abyss if such acts of terror are allowed,"" the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong SAR said in a statement.

 The most urgent and common aspiration of the Hong Kong public is to end violence and restore peace and order, the liaison office added.

 The past weekend saw illegal protests on Hong Kong Island, in Kowloon and the New Territories, as protesters adopted hit-and-run tactics.

 A total of 149 people were arrested for taking part in the illegal protests and suspicion of committing violent acts over the weekend, according to the police.

 Fifteen of them were classified as ""extreme violent rioters"". They were arrested in relation to the protests in Causeway Bay on Sunday night. Police said they classified the 15 suspects because they had allegedly used ""lethal weapons"".

 Deputy Police Commissioner Chris Tang Ping-keung said the police have zero tolerance for violence.

 Meanwhile, around 4 pm on Monday, Airport Authority Hong Kong canceled the day's remaining flights after thousands of protesters swarmed the main terminal building for a fourth day, the biggest disruption yet to the major aviation hub since demonstrations began in early June.

 The cancellations came after operations at Hong Kong International Airport had become ""seriously disrupted"" by the sit-in, the authority said.

 On the same day, Hong Kong's Secretary for Transport and Housing Frank Chan Fan said in a news conference that the unlawful assembly will lead to enormous losses, damaging the economy and the livelihoods of airport staff, he said."
"Experts urge stop of violence in Hong Kong, denounce external forces","BEIJING, Aug. 22 -- Experts have urged an end to the blatant violence perpetrated by radical demonstrators in Hong Kong and denounced external forces behind the protests.

 Hong Kong, engulfed in protests since early June, has witnessed escalating violence lately involving services cut-off, airport riots, attack on police and assault of journalists, which risk tipping this once-prosperous financial hub and alluring tourist destination into recession.

 Madan Regmi, chairman of China Study Center, a Nepal-based think tank said he is saddened by the worrying situation in Hong Kong.

 Deeply concerned with the situation, he said ""the protesters, with ill intentions, are abusing the basic rights to realize their hidden interests ... and unlike normal protesters with reasonable demands.""

 Hong Kong enjoys its own system, quite different from the system in the Chinese mainland, Regmi said.

 ""But no matter how big differences are in these two areas, 'one China' policy is the precondition. What the violent protesters are doing has defied the one China principle in a degrading way,"" he stressed.

 In response to Hong Kong-related queries at a meeting with the foreign ministers of Japan and the Republic of Korea on Wednesday, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi condemned the violent attacks as a serious ""challenge of the bottom line"" of the ""one country, two systems"" principle governing Hong Kong.

 ""No responsible government or rule-of-law society will tolerate these acts,"" Wang said, emphasizing that Hong Kong affairs are China's internal affairs and brook no interference by external forces.

 Wang called on relevant parties to uphold an objective and fair position on the situation in Hong Kong.

 Comrade Dilip Barua, general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Bangladesh, expressed his deep concern regarding the violent unrest and blockades in Hong Kong in the name of so-called ""democratic movement.""

 ""Hong Kong is an integral part of China on the basis of 'one country, two systems,'"" which has functioned well since its return to China in 1997, Barua said.

 He urged Hong Kong people not to be ""misguided"" by ""some vested interest groups"" seeking to foil this fundamental principle but to engage in ""building up a more prosperous Hong Kong.""

 R.N.Bhaskar, consulting editor of ""Asia Converge"" and guest faculty at several institutes in India and overseas said the strikes and the airport blockades were ""a foolish move"" at the expense of huge economic losses to Hong Kong's businesses.

 Denouncing the provocations on local police, he said, ""don't provoke police, don't get violent, don't use force. Force will be met with force because you are challenging the sovereignty of the country.""

 ""Don't go on to strike, because the longer the strike, the worse will be the plight of business and so on,"" Bhaskar said, calling for more restraint rather than violence.

 John Zhang, honorary president of Shanghainese Association of Australia, said the future of Hong Kong is held in the hands of its people and not others, because this is purely an internal affair of China.

 He believed that demonstrations, whether in the United States, European countries or in Hong Kong, should be carried out in line with relevant laws and regulations, and not at the price of disrupting social order and grinding local services to a complete halt.

 Meanwhile, Hugh H. Mo, a former deputy police commissioner of New York City Police Department (NYPD), said that the right to protest should be respected on condition that it is carried out in line with laws.

 ""The police, a symbol of law, are the defenders of our society, and should never be treated as enemies,"" he said.

 The former NYPD officer said that he would like to see the rule of law restored in Hong Kong, a society long famous for its prosperity, good governance and friendliness.

 Faruk Boric, a renowned media commentator in Bosnia and Herzegovina and also chairman of BiH-China Friendship Association said that the Asian financial hub of Hong Kong, once crowned the ""Pearl of the Orient"" is dimmed by the ongoing violence, and will lose its luster if nothing is done to stop this.

 He called on young people in Hong Kong to cherish the region's hard-won economic status and participate constructively to restore peace, order and the dynamism for growth."
HKSAR gov't reiterates foreign legislatures should not interfere in internal affairs of HKSAR,"HONG KONG, Nov. 15 -- In response to a report issued by the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, the government of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) reiterated late on Thursday that foreign legislatures should not interfere in any form in the internal affairs of the HKSAR.

 Since its return to the motherland, Hong Kong has been exercising ""Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong"" and a high degree of autonomy in strict accordance with the HKSAR Basic Law, said a spokesman of the HKSAR government. ""The 'one country, two systems' principle has been fully and successfully implemented. The HKSAR government will continue to implement the 'one country, two systems' principle resolutely in accordance with the Basic Law.""

 On human rights and freedoms, the spokesman stressed that safeguarding human rights and freedoms is a constitutional duty of the HKSAR government, as Article 4 of the Basic Law stipulates that the HKSAR shall safeguard the rights and freedoms of the residents of the HKSAR and of other persons in the region in accordance with law.

 ""Human rights and freedoms in Hong Kong are fully protected by the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and other legislation, in addition to the Basic Law. The HKSAR government attaches great importance to human rights and freedoms and is determined to safeguard them,"" the spokesman said.

 ""At the same time, the HKSAR government has a duty to implement and uphold the Basic Law and to ensure that all elections will be conducted in accordance with the Basic Law and relevant electoral laws. There is no political screening,"" he added.

 Referring to the Basic Law which clearly stipulates that the HKSAR is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China (PRC), the spokesman pointed out that any suggestion for ""Hong Kong's independence"" is a blatant violation of the Basic Law and a direct affront to the national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity of the PRC.

 ""'Hong Kong's independence' runs counter to the successful implementation of 'one country, two systems' and undermines the HKSAR's constitutional and legal foundations as enshrined in the Basic Law. Relevant international human rights convention and court cases have clearly pointed out that freedom of speech is not absolute,"" he said.

 On the rule of law in Hong Kong, the spokesman said the HKSAR government is committed to safeguarding the rule of law and judicial independence in Hong Kong, and there is no question of ""political prosecutions"" as alleged by the U.S. report.

 ""Article 63 of the Basic Law entrenches the constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence. The conduct of all criminal prosecutions of the Department of Justice (DoJ) is free from any interference. Decisions to prosecute or not, as the case may be, must be based on an objective and professional assessment of the available evidence and the law, and be in accordance with the published Prosecution Code. No political consideration is being taken into account at all,"" he said.

 In respect of the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 (the Bill), the spokesman said HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced on June 15 that the Bill was suspended and later made it clear that all the legislative work had come to a complete halt. The chief executive further announced on Sept. 4 that the HKSAR government would formally withdraw the Bill and the secretary for security withdrew the Bill at the Legislative Council meeting on Oct. 23.

 ""In the past few months, there were a series of protests and public order events in Hong Kong. Some of them eventually became violent and illegal incidents, causing damage to district and community facilities as well as injury to members of the public. In response, the police have been exercising restraint and have been carrying out enforcement actions in strict accordance with the law,"" he said, stressing that the purpose of police's enforcement actions is to protect the life and property of the general public, bring offenders to justice and restore public order as soon as possible.

 The Independent Police Complaints Council is conducting a fact-finding study on the handling of large-scale public order events since June, including corresponding actions by the police, to ascertain the facts and will prepare a report. The content of the report will be made public.

 The HKSAR government has also launched a diversified dialogue platform and will invite community leaders, experts and academics to conduct an in-depth and independent examination of the social conflicts in Hong Kong and the deep-seated problems that must be addressed.

 Concerning constitutional development, the spokesman said to achieve the ultimate aim of universal suffrage enshrined in the Basic Law, the community needs to engage in dialogues, premised on the legal basis and under a peaceful atmosphere with mutual trust, with a view to narrowing differences and attaining a consensus agreeable to all sides.

 ""The HKSAR government will assess the situation carefully and take forward constitutional development in accordance with the Basic Law and the relevant Interpretation and Decisions of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.""

 Regarding strategic trade control, the spokesman said that Hong Kong, as a separate customs territory under the Basic Law, has been implementing comprehensive control on import, export and re-export of strategic commodities in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong and international control lists, carrying out rigorous enforcement, and maintaining close cooperation with the United States and other trading partners.

 ""Over the years, we have been closely collaborating with the U.S. administration and achieved satisfactory results in preventing illegal diversion of strategic commodities. Our efforts in this regard are recognized by the relevant authorities. We regret deeply that despite our repeated explanation, the report has still erroneously cited a totally irrelevant case to cast doubt on Hong Kong's strategic trade control system,"" he said."
Protesters in Hong Kong shock world with ugly tactics,"NICOSIA, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- Over the last week, Hong Kong has been disrupted from top to bottom by black-clad radicals hell-bent on causing chaos and wrecking the economy.

 Everywhere, public life has been severely disturbed.

 In such a climate, it comes as little surprise that the public are increasingly looking for a return to order and normality on this once-tranquil territory of China.

 The international community is also looking on with increasing dismay at frenzied mob violence which has seen the radicals hurl rocks, use petrol bombs, fire slingshots, and let off air guns.

 Even Bonnie Leung, a key protest organizer, was forced onto the back foot and publicly acknowledged on British radio that there are ""radical protestors"" amongst her ranks.

 Her admission came after BBC host Razia Iqbal asserted: ""It is factually accurate, isn't it, that the protestors are becoming increasingly more violent?""

 Protests at the airport earlier this week not only left the aviation industry reeling, but terrified holidaymakers, businessmen, families and others who were needlessly dragged into the fray.

 In one especially ugly encounter, protesters screamed at a passenger carrying a child. Other passengers were verbally abused by the protesters, while a reporter from the Chinese mainland was left badly shaken after being zip-tied to a luggage trolley and physically assaulted.

 Even Britain's The Guardian newspaper observed that it was ""not the first time that protesters have used violent tactics."" The paper reported ""they have been seen on a number of occasions hurling bricks and other items at riot police, while a police officer over the weekend was injured by a petrol bomb.""

 Over the last few days, the government calls for calm in Hong Kong have contrasted sharply with the dismissive arrogance of those tearing up the streets, who, it seems, have neither the courage nor the integrity nor the respect for their fellow citizens to comprehend the damage they are creating.

 If tensions escalate further, the prospect of a greater economic backlash seems inevitable. And that, many observers say, would suit protesters as they continue to drag Hong Kong deeper into a crisis.

 Mob violence leads to more mob violence.

 The 7 million citizens of Hong Kong -- with their frayed nerves and growing anxiety -- continue to remain hostage to a small clique of increasingly violent radicals.

 Easing their suffering with a return to normality must now be the absolute priority."
"""One country, two systems"" to go far and steady: spokesperson","Yang Guang (C), a spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, remarks on the recent protests and violent incidents in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) at a press conference held in Beijing, capital of China, July 29, 2019. (Xinhua/Cai Yang)

 BEIJING, July 29 -- A spokesperson Monday expressed the confidence that the ship of ""one country, two systems"" will sail far and steady despite winds and storms.

 Yang Guang, spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said at a press conference in Beijing that with the full support of the central government and the mainland, and under the leadership of Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government, Hong Kong compatriots are surely able to govern, develop and manage Hong Kong well.

 ""Hong Kong will surely overcome all difficulties and challenges on its way forward,"" Yang said.

 He said since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the practice of ""one country, two systems"" in the region has been a widely recognized success, and the policies of ""one country, two systems,"" ""Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong,"" and a high degree of autonomy have been faithfully implemented.

 The central government will continue to unswervingly implement the principle of ""one country, two systems"" and ensure that this principle remains unchanged and is not bent or distorted in practice, Yang said."
"New semester starts in Hong Kong, violence deplored","People attend a flag-raising ceremony at the Wong Cho Bau School in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), Sept. 2, 2019. (Xinhua/Qin Qing)

 Hong Kong has more than 1,000 kindergartens, 587 elementary schools, 506 secondary schools, and 22 institutions that confer higher education degrees. Classes began on Monday without disturbances, despite boycott calls from the opposition.

 ""I can't help worrying about not being able to get to work, a traffic jam or a station shut down due to the protests. Demands should be expressed in a sensible manner, instead of disrupting people's lives and causing fear,"" a teacher said.

 HONG KONG, Sept. 2 (Xinhua) -- School principal Wong Kam-Leung spread a message of peace, hard work and loving one's own country as he made his first-day-of-school speech.

 On Monday, 800 students and teachers gathered for a national flag-raising ceremony at a spacious hall of Wong Cho Bau School in the New Territories. Flag-raising at the beginning of a school year is its tradition.

 ""It saddens me to see all the controversy and disturbances in Hong Kong over the summer. Those young people who threw a national flag into the sea must have very low respect for the flag and the country. Today's ceremony is significant. It teaches students to respect the country,"" he told a roomful of attendees.

 ""We can only have a safe home and a nice place to study when we have a strong nation at our back. For Hong Kong to develop, it must integrate into the overall picture of the Chinese nation, and that is the way for young people in Hong Kong to find success in the future,"" he said.

 As students return to school, a handful of violent demonstrators disrupted the morning public commuting by blocking train doors.

 To avoid possible disturbances by riots, teachers arrived at the school early on Monday morning, said Sharon Yau, one of the 60 teachers at the school.

 ""I can't help worrying about not being able to get to work, a traffic jam or a station shut down due to the protests. Demands should be expressed in a sensible manner, instead of disrupting people's lives and causing fear,"" she said.

 A team of 19 young flag guards in white uniforms marched in the ceremony, while their classmates watched respectfully. All stood at attention as the flag was hoisted.

 ""I'm nervous but very excited. We practiced a lot to make sure we march at the same pace. This is a huge honor for me,"" said 9-year-old April Lam, who joined the flag guard team five months ago.

 Hong Kong has more than 1,000 kindergartens, 587 elementary schools, 506 secondary schools, and 22 institutions that confer higher education degrees. Classes began on Monday without disturbances, despite boycott calls from the opposition. Kindergartens canceled classes due to torrential downpours.

 On Monday, yellow school buses were visible on the streets. Most schools in Hong Kong were generally normal on the first school day, and the traffic was smooth, said Kevin Yeung Yun-hung, secretary for education of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government.

 ""In the past few weeks, we have been liaisoning and discussing with different stakeholders in the sector to ensure normal school operation as far as possible. Of course, we need to monitor the situation closely, and we are prepared to provide support to schools if necessary,"" Yeung said.

 ""I think it's a common value in the society and also among the education sector that schools should not be used as places to make political demands or to put pressure on the government for political needs,"" Yeung added.

 RESTORING ORDER AT SCHOOLS

 Long before the new academic year kicked off on Monday, concerns had been mounting about possible campus bullying, especially those targeting children of police officers.

 The personal data of at least 1,662 police officers and their families have been illegally disclosed online since June, including pictures of the children of the police and information about their schools and classes.

 In some cases, teachers reportedly encouraged bullying against children of the police. In response, Yeung issued a stern warning that the schools concerned must ""take disciplinary action"" and the education bureau will impose punishment accordingly, including considering whether they are still qualified to be an educator.

 In the face of cyberbullying and threats of attacks against children of the police, personal alarm devices were offered to police with children under the age of 18, according to media reports.

 According to the police, 117 liaison officers keep in contact with primary and secondary schools to offer assistance if necessary.

 The unrest since early June has already had a negative impact on some middle school students, sending an alarm to teachers, parents, and civil groups. Two petrol bombs were found among the belongings of a 13-year-old suspect detained recently.

 In an open letter to all elementary and middle schools in Hong Kong, a civil group named Safeguard Hong Kong warned of possible class boycotts and campus bullying and called for efforts to bring the ""nature of education"" back to schools.

 CALLS TO END CHAOS

 The prolonged protests and violence have drawn ire among the public. On Monday, a handful of violent demonstrators disrupted morning commuting by blocking train doors. Hong Kong opposition also bewitched students to boycott classes to keep tensions high.

 Denouncing the new wave of disruptive and even dangerous behaviors, many people are appealing for peace and rational thinking.

 Before the new semester began, Margaret Chan, former director-general of the World Health Organization, called on students not to skip classes amid the current chaos and refrain from violent protests.

 ""School years are the most beautiful and precious time in one's life,"" Chan, who is also a mother, said in a statement to students. ""Cherish your time, get yourselves prepared for a beautiful future.""

 The current situation also left Yu Kwok-chun, vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, in distress, particularly when he saw teenagers and students being instigated into violent acts.

 ""I hope students can calm down and return to campus for the new semester,"" Yu said.

 Yu's concerns were echoed by Lam Suk-yee, former president of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions.

 ""The unrest has brought mayhem to Hong Kong's economy and public security, and greatly damaged infrastructure facilities,"" Lam said. ""Such acts are harming others and not benefiting society. Our residents have had enough.""

 She hoped all students and workers, white- or blue-collar, can stick to their posts amid efforts to stop violence, end the chaos, restore order and rebuild a prosperous and stable Hong Kong."
World's longest sea bridge outperforms,"Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. [Photo by Wu Changfu/Zhuhai Daily]

 The tourism and logistics sectors in Hong Kong, Macao and western Guangdong province have great market potential thanks in large part to the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, a year after the world's longest cross-sea thoroughfare opened to traffic, according to industry insiders.

 The 55-kilometer bridge has served over 24 million passengers－an average 67,000 per day－since its opening on Oct 24 last year, according to the Guangdong government.

 Over 70,000 vehicles from Hong Kong, Guangdong and Macao have registered to be able to use the bridge, and since its opening, over 1.5 million vehicles have crossed the bridge.

 Timothy Chui Ting-pong, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, said the bridge has become a tourist spot across the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area due to its unique engineering design and the magnificent views of mountains, city and sea.

 Chui said the bridge has attracted a growing number of travelers to or from Hong Kong since its opening, with travel time to traverse the structure's span under an hour.

 However, he said that due to recent unrest in Hong Kong, visitors to the city from across the world have slumped.

 Chui hoped Hong Kong would return to order as soon as possible, and he believed the number of travelers will pick up afterward.

 He hopes tourist facilities on the artificial island at the eastern end of the bridge will open to visitors soon and further unleash the tourism potential of the structure.

 As of the end of September, goods with a total value of $8.4 billion have been transported across the bridge, with products coming from 26 provinces on the Chinese mainland. Over 90 percent of the goods were from Zhuhai.

 Frank Jin, founder of a Zhuhai-based customs declaration broker, assists companies in passing through customs checkpoints at the bridge before passing into Hong Kong.

 With about 300 cargo vehicles traveling between Hong Kong and Zhuhai over the bridge on an average day, Jin said his companies have dealt with over 10,000 customs declarations in the past year amid steady growth in freight volume.

 Jin said many large manufacturing companies in southwestern Guangdong sending their goods to Hong Kong for export have successively changed their transport routes from ports in Shenzhen to ports at the bridge, which save them some three hours on the road.

 Most of them are enterprises in Zhuhai, such as electronics manufacturers like Philips and Panasonic, Jin said.

 It takes time for market demand to kick in, while the operation of manufacturing companies doesn't change overnight, Jin added.

 Noting that protests in Hong Kong have affected some businesses across the border, Jin said he remains positive about the future.

 He believed the total volume of freight traffic on the bridge will double next year.

 Kou Kun-pang, president of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport in Macao, said the bridge has provided more transport options for residents and travelers in Macao.

 Kou noted that at least 40 percent of frequent ferry passengers now more often turn to the bridge for travel between Hong Kong and Macao.

 As the bridge is also located beside the Hong Kong International Airport, Kou said it has attracted more people in Macao to the airport due to reduced travel time."
Op-ed: Time to stop violence and restore order in Hong Kong,"Over the past two months, the protests in Hong Kong have gone beyond assembly or demonstration and have evolved into extreme violence. Hong Kong has been left in a state of shock by the acts of protesters, increasing intensity and escalating destructions, posing significant economic and social threats to the city. Hong Kong cannot afford any more chaos.

 The situation in Hong Kong is now so dire that the urgent task before the entire community is evident: to stop violence and restore order. It is high time for Hong Kong citizens to step out to safeguard their home. To stop violence and end the chaos, everyone needs to stand out, be it employees or employers, social elites or ordinary citizens, the elderly or the young. They must make their voice of justice heard, say “no” to violence, and staunchly support the Chief Executive of Hong Kong SAR and the government. They need to unswervingly stand by the police who strictly enforce the laws and should engage in activities which help to restore order and promote positive energy throughout the society.

 The fundamental problem is who will suffer and who will benefit from the chaos when it gets out of control? We believe that the highest aspiration of Hong Kong citizens is to seek stability and tranquility, and to restore social order and normal life as soon as possible. We hope that Hong Kong citizens who love Hong Kong and their country will stand up for a stable life and a better future."
"American living in Hong Kong tells true story about ""peaceful protesters""","HONG KONG, Nov. 6 (Xinhua) -- More than five months ago, Dan Albertson, 35, left Chicago where he had lived for 10 years to start a new life in Hong Kong. Like many other travelers, he looked forward to the fresh experience in this free and open international metropolis of China.

 However, violent protests and destructive activities erupted all of a sudden and kept intensifying in the months following.

 ""Parts of my neighborhood are now ransacked almost every weekend. It has become as predictable as the sunrise. I am tired of seeing this needless destruction, and tired of the excuses, the justifications, the silence,"" the U.S. writer and translator said in an open letter published on Facebook.

 Covering a wide range of topics from the rampage of rioters to distortion in media reports, the open letter was translated into Chinese and published by multiple media outlets.

 Albertson, living in a small apartment in Kowloon, has witnessed with his own eyes how escalating violence and lawlessness pushed the prosperous, dynamic global financial and trade center into chaos inch by inch since June.

 ""I thought that I had to write something and express to people what it is like in Hong Kong. It requires one to speak out, because to remain silent is to become complicit,"" Albertson said.

 While those contributing to the months-long unrest in Hong Kong were described as ""peaceful protesters"" in some media reports, Albertson believes the term can only be used with quotation marks.

 ""They are obviously not peaceful,"" Albertson said, citing violent acts including vandalism of public facilities, destruction in stores and bitter assaults on residents holding different views. ""The only thing that they can show is that they can destroy.""

 Over the weekend, Hong Kong was again under the rampage of mobsters. Besides routine activities from blocking roads and hurling petrol bombs to attacking police and trashing shops, the office building of a media outlet was vandalized.

 More than 300 were arrested over illegal and violent acts and 12 police officers were injured.

 In the past few months, 85 metro stations had been damaged, 460 sets of traffic lights out of order, and more than 40,000 meters of iron railing were torn down.

 ""There's no way you can have a better life by destroying your city,"" Albertson said. ""When you smash stores, you also smash the ability of somebody to do what you and I do, which is to do a job and to get paid for it. Nobody has the right to do that.""

 Some protesters once told Albertson that there was no more important issue in Hong Kong right now than taking to street. ""I was very skeptical,"" he said.

 ""There are many other issues in Hong Kong, like building more affordable housing, making the transit better, and controlling air pollution, which are something that can actually make Hong Kong a better place,"" Albertson said.

 Albertson said unfortunately his friends in Europe and the United States did not know what was happening in Hong Kong as there was a big gap between some media reports and the real situation.

 ""I read a lot of irresponsible reports about unconfirmed information, even rumors, and releases of selective and edited videos to show police brutality,"" Albertson said.

 ""If there's one police officer surrounded by a group of people, what do you expect him to do? Do you expect him to lie down and let people beat him up that way? The media outlets never showed protesters action before. They want you to see the after video,"" Albertson said.

 In regard of the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 pushed by some U.S. lawmakers, Albertson thought it was groundless as the rights of Hong Kong residents were fully guaranteed from his knowledge.

 ""Instead, the protesters have too much freedom. I would struggle to think of a place where you could do this kind of behavior for more than 20 weekends in a row,"" Albertson said.

 Albertson loves to travel and has visited many parts of the world, including some cities in the Chinese mainland. Trips were also made by him to Hong Kong many times before. He deplored the fact that the used-to-be free and inclusive place has been plunged deeper and deeper into violence.

 Expected to leave Hong Kong in a year due to job changes, Albertson hopes to see restored peace when he is still here. ""I love Hong Kong, I want to see it remain an inviting, inclusive and special place,"" he said."
Op-Ed: Hong Kong is not and shall not be the frontline of US and China,"Hong Kong has been rocked by chaos and violence for weeks and the violence is getting more and more intense. What is going on in Hong Kong? There is already evidence of interference by foreign forces. As Chinese officials have pointed out, the situation in Hong Kong bears the features of a ""color revolution.""

 US politicians have openly supported the unrest and anti-China forces are working behind the scenes. In fact, the US government often uses democracy promotion to attack other countries, and China has always been a major target.

 In recent years, there have been warnings that color revolutions are emerging as a new form of warfare employed by the West to destabilize certain countries. According to a Defense News article that was published in 2014, officials at a conference in Moscow accused the US and its allies of engineering revolutions and uprisings in key areas around the world to destabilize governments and replace existing regimes to gain power and resources.

 Promoting Western-style democracy has long been a US foreign policy aim. For those who subscribe to this thinking, the best way to guarantee long-term security and prosperity in the Western world is to make the world look and act more like the West. For this reason, there is always funding for democracy promotion in US foreign policy.

 US institutions like the National Endowment for Democracy play a key role in this strategy. They fund, train, and equip leaders and groups who serve the American interest. In fact, the congressionally funded NED exists solely to promote Western-style democracy abroad. Last year, for example, NED provided the Washington-based National Democratic Institute for International Affairs with $200,000 “to facilitate engagement on Hong Kong’s growing threats to guaranteed rights.”

 When it comes to color revolutions, failure is the most likely result. To understand the failure of Western-backed efforts to turn people against their governments, look no further than the Arab world. In 2011, the “Arab Spring” opened a door for the US government to spread the long tentacles of Western-style democracy. Seeing an opportunity to expand Western power and influence under the guise of mass protests, the US government expanded efforts to undermine certain Arab governments in the name of democracy.

 The unrest that swept the Arab world resulted in increased violence and instability rather than peace and prosperity for the people. In Libya, where the United States led an intervention that resulted in the violent and gruesome overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi, a civil war is raging, and the people of Libya are suffering. The truth is, the turmoil caused by color revolutions is long lasting and America’s obsession with fanning the flames of color revolutions simply makes it look nasty in the eyes of the world.

 There is plenty of evidence to show that not only are color revolutions ineffective, but there are unintended consequences, as the mess in the Arab world highlights. It would be a disaster to expand this strategy of warfare to the world’s second largest economy with a population of 1.4 billion people.

 Some US politicians dream of making China look and act more like the United States. One reason we are seeing increased pressure on China is because those who have tried to change China over the years via other methods have failed and there is growing fear that China is getting too powerful, so the Uncle Sam will never miss any opportunity to undermine China. 

 However, Hong Kong is Chinese territory. This means that the city is not and shall not be a playground for anti-China forces. China is no longer a poor and weak country that cannot stand up to foreign interference. The country has enough methods and strength to quickly quell the unrest and smash foreign plots when such actions are deemed necessary to protect national sovereignty and the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong."
"HK people urged to stop violence and chaos, bring back order","BEIJING, Aug. 6 (Xinhua) -- A spokesperson on Tuesday urged people in Hong Kong to stop the violence and chaos and bring back order.

 It is the immediate task facing all Hong Kong residents, which is very clear given the severe state of affairs in the region today, said Yang Guang, spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, at a press conference.

 Yang called on people in Hong Kong to stand firm and guard their beautiful homeland, stressing that now is the crucial moment.

 ""Here we sincerely hope the compatriots in Hong Kong will think calmly about the questions: Who will suffer if the situation becomes irremediable, and who will benefit in the end?""

 All departments and organs of Hong Kong should never be soft on violent violations of the law, Yang stressed.

 Reiterating the central government's unswerving support for Chief Executive Carrie Lam, the spokesperson said the opposition's attempt to force her to resign is doomed to fail.

 ""We hope that the people of Hong Kong understand the nature of the current situation and firmly support Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam in leading the HKSAR government's law-based governance, the Hong Kong police in enforcing laws rigorously and departments of the HKSAR government and the judiciary body in punishing violent criminals in accordance with the law,"" Yang said.

 He then made it clear to ""the very small group of unscrupulous and violent criminals and the dirty forces behind them"" that those who play with fire will perish by it, and that whoever participates in violent and criminal activities would be held accountable according to the law.

 ""All in all, the fate of Hong Kong will be decided by all Chinese people including Hong Kong compatriots,"" Yang added.

 Xu Luying, also a spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, said the violence and conflict that transpired recently in Hong Kong were, in essence, manipulated behind the scenes by elements who aim to destabilize and damage Hong Kong.

 They use young people as the ""chess pieces"" and ""cannon fodder"" for their political schemes, Xu said, noting that more and more young people will see their true colors, realize the errors and turn back from the wrong path.

 Acknowledging that young people in Hong Kong do face many difficulties growing up, Xu said that these can not be resolved through violence or law-breaking.

 ""We advise those young people who have participated in the protests or even some violent conflicts to stop and return to the correct path of law and order,"" Xu said.

 Yang said that the deteriorating situation in Hong Kong is linked to the irresponsible remarks concocted by some western politicians.

 ""Hong Kong is part of China. Interference into the Hong Kong affairs by any foreign countries should not be allowed,"" he said."
Central govt reaffirms strong support for Lam,"Situation in HK has improved, but remains grim: spokesperson

 The Chinese central government on Tuesday reiterated its firm support for Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor's efforts to put an end to violence, and said the situation in Hong Kong has improved but remained grim.

 At Tuesday's press conference in Beijing, two spokespersons of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council mentioned Lam's name five times, stressing that the central government firmly supports her and her team to implement policies in accordance with laws, and to pursue constructive discussions with different groups, including young people, in the city.

 Spokesperson Yang Guang said during the Tuesday conference in Beijing the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government and society's current priority is to put an end to the violence and chaos, and restore order, urging Hongkongers to say no to violence and to support Lam's administration in strictly enforcing the law.

 Yang also said the central government supports Lam and her team to communicate with people from all walks of life to explore solutions to Hong Kong's economic development and livelihood improvement.

 'Never resigned'

 The spokespersons' comments came after Lam's press conference in Hong Kong on Tuesday morning, in which she refuted a Reuters report, claiming that she has never submitted any resignation to the central government, and that she is confident that she can lead the city out of its current crisis.

 ""A conversation from a private party has been made public. I think it's very inappropriate. I am very disappointed,"" Lam said, in response to an audio recording of a private speech made public by Reuters on Monday late night.

 ""My speech in the audio was private. It was not supposed to be made public, so there was no deliberate implication in my choice of words,"" Lam said.

 The Reuters report quoted Lam as saying she has caused ""unforgivable havoc"" by allowing the ongoing protests across Hong Kong, and would quit if she had a choice. This was reported on the basis of an audio recording of remarks she made last week during a closed-door meeting with a group of businesspeople.

 Lam also allegedly said that if she had a choice, ""The first thing [I would do] would be to quit, having made a deep apology,"" the Reuters report said.

 ""I said on several occasions that throughout the period, I have never submitted my resignation to the central government. The choice not to resign is my own. I told myself that my team and I should stay on. It is not an easy path but I'd rather stay with the people of Hong Kong,"" Lam said.

 She said at least five times that she has never wanted to resign.

 Tang Fei, a member of the council of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies in Hong Kong, said the released audio would give the opposition forces the illusion that the central government and the SAR government will allow the chaos to continue, further raising the level of violence and so-called extreme pressure.

 ""Therefore, Lam issued a statement to clarify the truth. Her tactic to deal with the crisis should be acknowledged, and Lam should launch an investigation on who divulged the audio,"" Tang told the Global Times on Tuesday.

 Hong Kong political elites are now on the frontline as the geopolitical pattern has been evolving amid the China-US trade war. And it's very normal for Lam to experience emotional ""ups and downs"" in such a difficult time, Li Xiaobing, an expert on Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan from Nankai University in Tianjin, told the Global Times on Tuesday.

 The central government's comments showed there is no substitute for Lam and she can continue performing her duties. And such official comments sent a strong signal that the solution to Hong Kong's situation rests on the SAR government, not on the central government, Tang said.

 However, Li pointed out that without being creative, Lam's administration could not lead Hong Kong out of the current crisis, as its highly autonomy system will not always be an absolute advantage for the city, especially when the gap between China and the Western world has narrowed.

 Hong Kong society should be prepared for a huge crisis, both from the outside and within, weighing on its decades of prosperity, the expert noted.

Part of interference

 Some Western media, including Reuters, have been entangled in the false news that Lam's resignation has not been approved for some time.

 This news followed another Reuters ""exclusive"" report on Friday, which claimed that Lam had submitted a proposal to Beijing earlier this summer, asking that the five key demands from the Hong Kong protesters should be taken seriously, and that the proposal was subsequently rejected.

 The Global Times has since learned the Reuters ""exclusive"" story was ""fake.""

 Chinese analysts slammed the reports for seriously violating professional ethics, and have become part of outside interference into Hong Kong's situation.

 The reports were aimed at sabotaging relations between the SAR government and the central government, they pointed out.

 Tuesday afternoon's press conference in Beijing sent a message to Western media that the Chinese government has faith in Lam's administration. The support for her and the SAR government will not be discorded by the noise, Tang said.

 Yang, the spokesperson, pointed out that opposition groups want an election process to select a Hong Kong chief executive who represents their stance and would not be responsible to the central government, to pave the way for them to govern Hong Kong.

 ""Hong Kong's electoral system must be based on the Basic Law and approved by China' top legislature,"" said Yang, stressing that the only principle for the system is that it must be consistent with Hong Kong's political status."
HK freedoms threatened by protesters' Xinhua rampage,"Hong Kong rioters' rampage at Xinhua News Agency's Asia-Pacific Bureau on Saturday has drawn wide criticism as an act that wantonly undermines freedom of the press.

 The attack has fed into growing concern about the deliberate suppression of the city's long-cherished freedom of expression and the press sparked by rioters having targeted some media organizations in Hong Kong, as well as many innocent people, who were beaten for holding different opinions from the radicals.

 In a new upwelling of violence across the city, rioters targeted the long-established national news agency bureau in downtown Hong Kong's Wan Chai area.

 The rioters destroyed the office building's security facilities, set fires in front of the building and threw firebombs into the lobby. They spray-painted insulting messages on the outer walls and smashed the front gate and some of the windows. 

 A Xinhua spokesperson expressed the news agency's ""strong indignation with and condemnation of"" the rioters' violent acts, which showed that ""stopping violence, curbing chaos and restoring order"" are the most important and urgent tasks for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

 The spokesperson urged Hong Kong police to vigorously investigate the incident.

 The Hong Kong Federation of Journalists, representing some 1,000 journalists, lashed out at the targeting of Xinhua News Agency.

 The vandalism amounted to an act of serious provocation of the State media agency and a wanton violation of freedom of the press in Hong Kong, the federation said.

 On Sunday, the All-China Journalists Association said in a statement that the vandalism at the Xinhua bureau was a gross act of trampling on press freedom and a serious provocation to democracy and the rule of law.

 The association said it will safeguard the rights and interests of news organizations and journalists, and it urged the city to punish the perpetrators of illegal acts in accordance with the law, so as to create a fair, just, free and democratic environment for the press.

 Earlier, Hong Kong Television Broadcasts Ltd applied to the High Court for an interim injunction banning rioters' assaults on its employees and damage to property when its staff cover the anti-government protests.

 The Hong Kong News Executives' Association issued a statement condemning the vandalizing of the Xinhua bureau, urging police to undertake strict measures to ensure the normal operation of news organizations.

 Qiu Hong, deputy director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong SAR, also voiced her objection after a public event on Sunday.

 Citing a commentary in People's Daily, Qiu said that unlawful conduct targeting news agencies is intolerable in any country. She expressed firm support for police containing the violence and restoring social order, and she called for the public to make concerted efforts to help restore calm.

 Lau Siu-kai, vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, told China Daily that the attack on Xinhua is an escalation of the rioters' repeated acts of destruction at enterprises and organizations with strong ties to the Chinese mainland.

 Recently, a number of mainland-linked bookstores, banks, and retail stores have been repeatedly vandalized during the violent protests, which have been going on for nearly five months.

 Veteran Malaysian journalist Wong Chun Wai told China Daily on Sunday that the attack on the Xinhua bureau was ""unacceptable"" as it went against the very essence of democracy. ""To put it bluntly, it borders on terrorism."" Wong said.

 ""In any democracy, we may not agree with each other, but we must defend and uphold the right of the views of others,"" said Wong, a former chief editor of Star Media Group Berhad, a leading Malaysian news outlet.

 He added that if such an incident were to occur in Malaysia, the culprits would have been swiftly identified, arrested and charged in the courts."
HK riots exacerbate life of drifters,"It's a city full of vitality and opportunities where people have high hopes of living a successful life. And throughout the years they have been studying and working here. It could be said that the global financial hub and Fragrant Harbor lived up to their expectations before the months-long unrests sowed the seeds of distress among them.

 They are known as Hong Kong drifters, referring to people mostly hailing from the Chinese mainland who came to the city hoping to change their life for the better. They are less talked about compared with their counterparts in Beijing. Beijing drifters means non-locals who strive to seek a living in the capital city. But opting to become a Hong Kong drifter is, in most cases, about a more difficult mission to be fulfilled, factoring in the costly life and prevalent use of Cantonese.

 A majority of those working in Hong Kong through the city's talent admission scheme work in the financial sector, some drifters working typical financial jobs told the Global Times recently.

 ""As far as I'm concerned, 60-70 percent of people who came here to pursue graduate studies and eventually chose to stay in the city engage in finance. Including those starting a career in the insurance sector, that could mean 90 percent,"" said Nick Yao, an asset manager at a local brokerage house.

 Yao, from Ningbo, East China's Zhejiang Province completed his undergraduate studies in finance at a mainland university before applying for a master's degree in financial journalism at a university in Hong Kong.

 He began his career in the city as a financial reporter, but it was not long before he switched to a financial job, betting that the financial sector fits better into his career development.

 Higher salaries for financial professionals contribute to the switch.

 Financial industry employees could earn between HK$30,000 ($3,826.26) and HK$300,000 per month, much higher than those from other sectors, whose starting salaries average only half of those in the financial sector, according to Ding Xue, an executive of a mainland securities firm's Hong Kong branch. Ding came from Wuhan, Central China's Hubei Province.

 As one of the world's most vibrant financial centers, the contribution of the financial services sector to the city's GDP grew to 18 percent in 2016 from 13 percent in 2004, according to data from the Census and Statistics Department of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).

 Climbing the ladder of success

 Having built a career with a handsome salary, Yao and Ding apparently felt the taste of success.

 It's even more of the case for Gary Zhao, from Hangzhou, East China's Zhejiang Province, and his wife Ms. Yuan, born in Shaoxing, Zhejiang. Under the auspices of their families, the young couple made a down payment on an apartment in Hong Kong in 2015, something even many locals can't afford.

 The couple, who both work in the financial sector, acquired Hong Kong permanent residence status after more than seven years studying and working in the metropolis.

 Zhao, an information technology major, pursued graduate studies in Hong Kong. And he stayed in the city after graduation. But rather than developing a career in the IT sector, he set his eyes on the financial sector, citing concerns that the development of Hong Kong's IT sector remains restrained and that the sector is dominated by Hongkongers, undercutting the competitive edge of mainlanders who can't speak fluent Cantonese.

 Zhao can speak Cantonese now, albeit with an accent. His wife, having been in the city for 13 years since pursuing undergraduate studies, sounds just like locals.

 Cantonese fluency is surely an indicator of levels of integration into the city, especially for those from non-Cantonese-speaking provinces and cities.

 Another couple the Global Times met in Hong Kong also sounds like natives. But unlike the four financial elite who got their admission tickets into the city mostly through education, the couple made their way to Hong Kong in a more traditional way.

 Leung Ming-hing came to Hong Kong with his parents from Shenzhen when he was born in 1962. The adoptive father of Leung's father provided shelter for them. Although the living conditions were much better in Hong Kong, Leung's family still had to work hard to eke out a living. He began working in a restaurant when he was 16 and has remained in the catering industry. His wife works in the tourism industry.

 They have a daughter who's attending a local university and a younger son, having truly settled in the city.

 Apparently, it is the prosperity of Hong Kong that has lured in many people from outside the city, although there are figures pointing to a decline in the number of people born in the mainland, Macao and Taiwan who come to live in Hong Kong.

 People born in the three parts of the country made up 33.5 percent of the city's total population in 2006. The ratio shrank slightly to 31 percent in 2016, according to an article posted on local news site hk01.com in 2017.

 The vast majority of the mainland-, Macao- and Taiwan-born Hongkongers came to Hong Kong before its return to the motherland in 1997, while the number of new immigrants hailing from these regions, referring to those settling in the city over the past two decades, total roughly 400,000, the article said.

 The provisional estimate of the city's population stood at 7.52 million by mid-2019, according to the latest figures from the Census and Statistics Department. From mid-2018 to mid-2019, there were 44,400 one-way permit holders from the mainland.

 Arduousness and unease

 The few drifters, some of whom have already settled in the city, the Global Times has spoken to could be considered standouts.

 Still, they have faced obstacles in genuinely integrating into the local community, citing language barriers and a mind-set divide.

 The riots in the past months seem to have exacerbated the issues. Failing to achieve fluency in Cantonese has become all the more a concern among mainlanders coming to settle in the city, as they fear the widening rift between locals and drifters from the mainland in the wake of the protests might mean speaking Cantonese tops the agenda of studying and working there.

 This is really discouraging, Yao said, sharing his discomfort about feeling estranged in an environment where some of the Cantonese speakers appear to be putting on air.

 What's more, Yao, who has been living in Hong Kong for six years, with only one year to go before getting his permanent residence status, has plans to buy an apartment in the city. The riots, though, might possibly shelve the plan, he said, venting his anger on the vandalism of radicals in Tung Chung, a transit hub close to the Hong Kong International Airport, which forced him to walk back to Tung Chung from the port of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge for more than two hours.

 ""If the current situation continues to worsen, I might consider opportunities in Shanghai and Shenzhen,"" he said, noting that he still holds faith in the city's institutional advantage for the time being.

 A commuter who relies heavily on the subway -the riots centered around subway stations - Ding also said her life has been greatly impacted by the unrest.

 There are no subway stations near Zhao's home and he commutes by minibuses. That means multiple acts of vandalism have not had a big impact on his life, although he said he has been under the weather because of the unrest.

 Furthermore, Zhao and his wife Yuan expressed concerns over the general education in Hong Kong which they believe had worsened the unrest. When they have children, they will make a list of schools in Hong Kong that are worry-free - meaning, they don't have a tendency to influence students in a biased way.

 They will filter through more than 2,000 schools across the city, according to Zhao. ""If it doesn't work, [we] might just send our children to a school in Shenzhen.""

 Leung and his wife, for their part, are now almost jobless, as the sectors they engage in are among the most affected by the unrest. The couple, saddened by the situation, hope for an end to the turbulence soon.

 ""Then our lives will return to normal again."""
Op-ed: Hong Kong police should stop violence using necessary force,"Protests went ahead on August 31 despite police objection. They besieged Hong Kong’s government and the Legislative Council building, placed flaming barricades on the streets, and threw gasoline bombs at the police.

 When severe illegal acts take place, and safety and public security are under threat, the Hong Kong police should be assertive in ending violence and riots.

 No matter whether in China or any other country, the police force has the right to make a decision facing extreme violence and control the situation in a tough way.

 Since June, the Hong Kong police have faced bricks and iron bars from radical protesters, as well as smears and rumors from unscrupulous media. However, they responded with the utmost restraint and reason and only used the minimum level of force to control disorder, which makes Chinese people proud as well as heartbroken.

 In sharp contrast, the protesters have injured hundreds of police officers with increasingly dangerous objects in a series of violent activities. Among the wounded, an off-duty policeman in Kwai Fong was attacked and stabbed by three protesters and had four fingers chopped off.

 These defiant acts have threatened property and personal safety and have gone far beyond the bottom line of civil society.

 Under such circumstances, the Hong Kong police have every right to respond with force, and take necessary measures to protect public order and security. Prompt decisions are needed on the spot, and any actions to stop violence are legal and reasonable.

 The protesters have been warned against naivety. The 7 million Hong Kongers back the Hong Kong police alongside 1.4 billion Chinese people. They have various means to safeguard peace and stability, and they are determined to stop the violence. Those who underestimate the capabilities of law enforcement and their determination to stop violence will soon concede."
Smart lamppost toppled by protesters in HK amid rising violence,"Hundreds of black-clad protesters clashed with riot police in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Saturday. Protesters threw bricks and gasoline bombs at police, who responded with tear gas, peppers pray and rubber bullets to disperse the mob after repeated warnings were futile.

 On August 24, protesters in helmets and gas-masks took to Kwun Tong District in Hong Kong, blocking roads, setting up barricades outside a local police station and tearing down at least one smart lamppost, which they claimed were equipped with closed-circuit cameras and facial recognition software. Protesters used an electric saw to slice through the bottom of a smart lamppost before pulling it down with ropes.

 The government in Hong Kong said that the smart lampposts are not equipped with facial recognition software and “would not infringe upon personal privacy.” Instead, they only collect data on traffic, weather and air quality with 5G technology in order to promote the development of the smart city. Each street lamp costs HK$680,000 ($ 86,697).

Hong Kong public protest against U.S. interference in Hong Kong affairs,"HONG KONG, Aug. 3 -- Members of the public in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) on Saturday gathered outside the U.S. Consulate General in Hong Kong to protest against the U.S. interference in Hong Kong affairs.

 Hundreds of protesters, who came in group in the drizzle, raised banners and placards with slogans expressing their anger, including ""Stop meddling in HK affairs and causing chaos"" and ""Foreign forces have no right to interfere.""

 ""Give the peaceful life back to the Hong Kong people!"" the crowd chanted.

 Some tried to pass letters of protest to the consulate but no one came out to receive the letters.

 ""We want stability and hope the U.S. side will stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and causing chaos,"" said Mr. Wong, one of the protesters.

 ""Wanton remarks of the U.S. side and other foreign forces have misled some of the radical youth to violence. Recent protests have severely disrupted Hong Kong residents' daily life,"" said Yeung, another protester.

 ""The Hong Kong people can handle Hong Kong's affairs, and I believe things will get better,"" he added.

 Young people and elderly residents alike joined the protest outside the consulate in Central District of Hong Kong.

 An elderly protester surnamed Wong told reporters that he believed foreign forces were behind recent violent incidents.

 ""Those violent radicals can not represent Hong Kong residents. What we want are stability, prosperity and well-being,"" he said.

 Weeks of demonstrations and violent incidents have undermined the rule of law and the social order of Hong Kong, and taken a toll on its retail and tourism sectors.

 ""The recent incidents have disrupted our life. We can't eat well or sleep well,"" said a female protester surnamed Wong.

 ""We hope the United States will stop their interference and give a peaceful Hong Kong back to us,"" she said."
US's double standard way out of line,"Some US politicians left no stone unturned to find a way to restrain China. Their recent activities in Hong Kong have not only exposed sheer hegemonism, but also showed the world their out-of-line double standard.

 The escalating illegal violence has seriously undermined Hong Kong’s social order, economy and people's life, distressing all residents who love Hong Kong and China.

 However, certain US officials are still distorting the truth, calling the illegal activities ""peaceful demonstrations"" and claiming that the Hong Kong police repressed the protesters when they were actually enforcing the law in a restrained manner.

 Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the US House of Representatives, repeatedly voiced her support of violent rioters in Hong Kong, who disabled main roads, demolished traffic lights, vandalized public property, hurled petrol bombs at police officers, committed arson, and possessed offensive weapons in Hong Kong.

 In June, Pelosi called the demonstrations in Hong Kong ""a beautiful sight to behold"", and in August, she made statements to support the protesters, calling rioters ""courageous"".

 Shortly after Pelosi expressed support for the radicals, black-clad and masked protestors damaged infrastructure and stores in the escalation of demonstrations in Portland, Oregon, the US.

 The local police set up roadblocks on the streets and bridges and arrested at least 13 demonstrators. The US officials even considered defining the organizations involved in the conflicts as terrorist organizations.

 This time, certain US politicians fell silent. They neither made irresponsible remarks about how American police officers enforced the law, nor praised violent acts as Pelosi had done.

 This is a full display of double standard adopted by certain US politicians, who are accustomed to regarding violent activities taking place in their own country as true violence that must be cracked down on and that in other countries are merely a ""sight"".

 It is not just some American politicians who played double standard. Recently, US social media Twitter and Facebook have removed a large number of accounts, claiming that these accounts spread false news about Hong Kong demonstrations, were unfavorable for the demonstrators and affected the legality of their protests.

 Twitter and Facebook have exposed the US hypocrisy on free expression. Even many foreign netizens have criticized the US social media's bald-faced suppression of different opinions.

 The US claims to be a country with free speech. In that case, any remark that doesn't violate the law should be protected. So which law in the US have these accounts violated? Is the so-called freedom of speech only a privilege for those who hold the same voice as the government? Are different opinions not allowed to be expressed?

 It is evident that some politicians in the US applaud the Hong Kong radicals for committing illegal violence, and attack the legal governance and solemn law enforcement exercised by Hong Kong government and Hong Kong police.

 Ignoring the truth and telling lies, the US politicians used double standard to pursue their own benefits. For those benefits, they exerted themselves to facilitate color revolutions and provoke riots around the world. To satisfy their greed, they twisted the facts and made slanderous remarks about other countries.

 Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China. Hong Kong affairs are purely China’s internal affairs. No one will be more concerned about the future of Hong Kong than the Chinese people.

 The double standard held by some US politicians can only reveal their sinister intention of destabilizing Hong Kong in order to raise the wave against China.

 We sincerely advise these people to stop meddling in other countries’ internal affairs. History will prove that they will only end up in failure if they have a finger in every pie. It will never work to stir up ""color revolution"" on China's Hong Kong."
"Violent, disruptive protests to hurt HK's prosperity, stability: former Dutch diplomat","THE HAGUE, Aug. 13 -- The increasingly violent and disruptive protests in China's Hong Kong are bad for the economic hub and will hurt its prosperity and stability, said a former Dutch consul-general to Hong Kong.

 Jochum Haakma, who served as consul-general of the Netherlands in Hong Kong/Macao and Shanghai from 1997 to 2006, made the remarks in a recent interview with Xinhua.

 ""Hong Kong has continued to prosper under the 'one country, two systems' principle and has become over the years economically more and more integrated with the mainland,"" said Haakma, currently chairman of the Netherlands-China Business Council and chairman of EU-China Business Association in Brussels.

 ""The Greater Bay Area initiative is a good example where high tech and R&D in Guangdong Province go hand in hand with the more advanced and refined international financial expertise and opportunities that Hong Kong brings to the equation,"" he said.

 ""The Belt and Road Initiative also offers enormous opportunities for a closer cooperation between Guangdong Province, the mainland at large and Hong Kong,"" he said.

 However, the increasingly violent and disruptive protests are very bad for the image and reputation of Hong Kong as an economic and financial hub in the region, said Haakma.

 ""It will certainly impact the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong in the long run. The GDP growth rate has already adjusted to a far lower percentage,"" said Haakma, who has more than 35 years of China experience.

 Haakma said the violent actions have gone beyond the freedom of demonstration and assembly and ""are merely caused by a small group of radicals.""

 He expressed his belief that the government of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, will be able to clear the situation without any interference from outside.

 China has slashed foreign interference on the Hong Kong situation and vowed that any attempt to interfere in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs is doomed to failure.

 ""Any attempt to undermine the 'one country, two systems' and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability will surely be resolutely opposed by all Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots,"" said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying last Wednesday.

 Hua urged the United States and some other Western countries to honor their commitment and stop supporting violent activities and intervening in Hong Kong affairs in any form, saying there are clear signs of foreign manipulation, plotting and even organization in the relevant violent incidents judging from what was reported by the media."
Commentary: Clamp down on riots in Hong Kong with law,"Any attempt to endanger national sovereignty and security, challenge the power of the central government and the authority of the Basic Law of the HKSAR or use Hong Kong to carry out infiltration and sabotage activities against the mainland is an act that crosses the red line, and is absolutely impermissible, said Chinese President Xi Jinping at the meeting celebrating the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland.

 China's red line of sovereignty has always been clear. The ultra-radicals deliberately challenge the red line in an attempt to destroy the constitutional order and clear the way for the revolution.

 In recent months, rioters have staged demonstrations, besieged and broken into the city's Legislative Council, vandalized the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR and assaulted police officers and members of the public.

 These violent acts have been well-organized and planned. The rioters make waves, create ""black terror"" which targets the masses, and daydream of dragging Hong Kong down.

 The rioters mistakenly believe that the ""five major demands"" they raise are representative of Hong Kong's popular will.

 However, the permanent withdrawal of the extradition bill is a meaningless request. Release of arrested protesters without charges and removal of the characterization of the June 12 protest as a riot are unreasonable demands. Setting up an independent inquiry commission and striving for full universal suffrage are violation of the rule of law and against the consensus of the whole society.

 The legal and constitutional order should not be broken and must be cemented.

 Rules are rules. Any attempt to cross or break the red line must be prohibited. Strict law enforcement from the police force is the first step, and harsh justice from judges in Hong Kong is the second step. The police and judicial system share the same mission of combating rioters.

 In the trial of the illegal ""Occupy Central"" movement, a judge said that the so-called “achieving justice by violating the law” had fanned unhealthy practices and made judges targets of verbal abuse, which was unacceptable.

 In the future, there will be no violence in the city of peace and prosperity, as long as the police forces do their best to protect Hong Kong and judges show the sword of justice against these rioters.

 Justice prevails over evil, and rioters will be placed in the hall of shame of Hong Kong."
Hong Kong-style riots to haunt West,"Supporters of the Catalan separatist movement publicly declared to have learned from the Hong Kong demonstrators, promoting the latter's tactics such as to ""be water"" and wearing masks to reduce the risk of being arrested. They seized the local airport on Monday and Tuesday, forcing a large number of flights to cancel. They also blocked roads and railways, set garbage cans on fire. Their slogan is ""We're going to do a Hong Kong!""

 Spain's Supreme Court on Monday sentenced nine Catalan separatist leaders to between nine and 13 years in jail, which, again, set local protesters ablaze. Demonstrations in Catalonia used to be peaceful. It seems that the protesters' use of violence in the four-month turmoil in Hong Kong has set an example for Catalan radicals.

 Spanish officials strongly condemned the violence. Politicians from the US and the West obviously have no idea how to comment at this point. The EU and the US used to firmly support the Spanish government in cracking down on the Catalan separatist movement. But the demonstrators say they are learning from Hong Kong, while protests in Hong Kong have been applauded by the West as a ""beautiful sight"" of democracy. What's happening in Hong Kong is now occurring in the West. This is awkward.

 Some mainstream Western media have kept a low key in covering the latest protests in Catalonia while downplaying its connection with Hong Kong or the slogan that local protesters are attempting to turn Catalonia into another Hong Kong.

 In addition, some environmentalists in the UK are imitating Hong Kong protesters by occupying the London City Airport. In Australia, a group of environmentalists are also attempting to carry out Hong Kong-style protests. Signs that violence in Hong Kong might be mimicked by Western societies are emerging. Catalonia is more like the beginning.

 The Western economy is overall sluggish and even in decline. Immigration issues, racial tensions and political differences have led to substantial dissatisfaction. At this point, making Hong Kong's violent protests an example is dangerous for Westerners.

 The violence in Hong Kong is not resistance against so-called tyranny, which is completely fabricated. It is the result of the West's double standards. Because of support from the West, Hong Kong protesters dare to confront their legal system in an unruly way. But their confrontation could be imitated by Western groups who are not satisfied with their situation.

 Some elites in the US and the West are lost in their extreme geopolitical and ideological mindsets. They believe the turmoil in Hong Kong will cause trouble for China, so they tend to extol Hong Kong protesters. However, thanks to the ""one country, two systems"" principle, the chaos in the city will not spread to the Chinese mainland, but the West is not immune to that.

 Catalonia is the first to be infected, but will not be the last. If the globalized world cannot jointly oppose violent political movements that challenge the order, it cannot be ruled out that the West will eventually become the severely afflicted area of the new type of violent movement."
Moody's change of Hong Kong's outlook lacks factual basis: HK financial secretary,"HONG KONG, Sept. 16 -- The change of Hong Kong's rating outlook by Moody's Investors Service lacks factual basis, Paul Chan Mo-po, the financial secretary of the government of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), said Monday.

 The HKSAR government disagrees with Moody's in the change of the outlook. Moody's argument that recent social incidents may weaken Hong Kong's institutional competitive advantage ""lacks factual basis"", Chan said.

 Moody's kept Hong Kong's Aa2 issuer rating but changed its outlook to negative from stable in a report issued earlier in the day.

 Hong Kong's core competitiveness remains unaffected by recent social incidents. It remains a top global financial hub and one of the easiest places to do business in the world with free flow of capital, goods, information and talents, low taxes, sound regulation, rule of law, judicial independence and professional service of high quality, Chan said.

 Even though recent protests have caught much attention, Hong Kong's financial market and banking system remain healthy without any significant capital outflow, he said.

 Deepening economic cooperation with the mainland will keep driving Hong Kong's growth in the long run, especially its highly competitive service sector, Chan added.

 Moody's also recognized Hong Kong's ""minimal debt burden and large fiscal reserves"" in its report, saying HKSAR has strong resilience to economic and financial shocks and the ability to address long-term structural challenges."
"Anti-China Twitter posts show automated behavior, study says","Twitter announced last month it has suspended nearly 1,000 user accounts, claiming they belonged to a ""state-backed information operation"" to spread disinformation about the ongoing protests in Hong Kong.

 Based on the findings of a research paper from Oxford University, however, this allegation is looking a little weak.

 The research paper, ""Chinese computational propaganda: automation, algorithms and the manipulation of information about Chinese politics on Twitter and Weibo"", revealed that, contrary to Twitter's claim, most of anti-China tweets on Twitter are released by automated or bot accounts.

 Co-authored by Gillian Bolsover and Philip Howard, two scholars from the Oxford Internet Institute, the paper studied whether China uses automated accounts for publicity and was published in the journal Information, Communication and Societyin September 2018.

 After analyzing posts and comments on Twitter and Weibo, the paper came to the conclusion that ""contrary to expectations and previous news reports, no evidence was found of pro-Chinese-state automation on Twitter"". However, a large amount of automation on Twitter was associated with anti-Chinese and published in simplified Mandarin, targeting Chinese users from the Chinese mainland and overseas, the paper said.

 ""These users come to Twitter seeking more diverse information and an online public sphere, but instead they find an information environment in which a small number of anti-Chinese-state voices are attempting to use automation to dominate discourse,"" it said.

 Data analysis from the research showed 71 out of the top 100 accounts on Twitter that posted content regarding China and Chinese politics posted all or almost all of their posts using third-party automation platforms, including twittbot.net, IFTTT (If This Then That) and dlvr.it. It also found ""many of these accounts appeared to be using custom automation scripts"".

 The paper also listed a number of characteristics of automation previous research has found: Compared with human Twitter users, the automated accounts tend to post more frequently; post around the clock; post content on only one or a few topics and have a higher percentage of retweets in their posts. In addition, these accounts often use similar bios and avatars, and tweet anti-Chinese content under the hashtag ""human rights"".

 Under the guise of ""democracy"" and ""human rights"", they attach links to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and human rights campaigns in their posts and pretend to be the embodiment of ""justice"". Their real intent is to incite anti-Chinese sentiment across the world and manipulate global public opinion on China.

 Twitter's removal of China-linked accounts has other side effects. Many ordinary users were affected by the removal, including Luka Ivezic, a 24-year-old student from King's College London. Luka's father is concerned the account suspension will become a stain on Luka's background and hinder his career.

 The BBC interviewed Luka, whose account appeared on Twitter's list and was suspended after four of his tweets were flagged.

 However, according to the listed tweets picked up by Twitter's moderators, the account was never used to tweet — or, it appears, retweet — anything remotely connected to the situation in Hong Kong, the report said.

 ""It is a bit ironic that something like this would happen to me,"" Luka told the BBC.

 ""From going through the data sets Twitter has released, it doesn't seem like [Twitter] was particularly precise. Some of it seems to have little or no connection to the protests,"" Elise Thomas of Australia's International Cyber Policy Center, a think tank which studies misinformation around the world, said in an email to the BBC.

 While allowing bot accounts spreading anti-China misinformation, Twitter deletes posts and accounts that support Hong Kong police and suspends accounts that had nothing to do with the unrest there. It does make one wonder if Twitter is as neutral as it claims."
"CNN’s reports on China show discrimination, a strong color of Cold War ideology","○ CNN reporter's ""out of turn question"" groundlessly links China's development to the Essex lorry tragedy accords with Western media's constant malice against China

 ○ Slandering China is not a new trick for CNN as it used to do so when reporting on March 14 riots in Lhasa

 ○ CNN's fake news report extends globally and was repeatedly refuted by officials worldwide

 ""Don't be too CNN-like!"" reads an Internet catchphrase popular 11 years ago that recently resurfaced in China as Chinese netizens accused CNN of owing the 39 Essex lorry tragedy victims, as well as Chinese people, an apology, not to mention ""so many historical bills the media bears responsibility for.""

 Browsing through CNN's previous reports on China, readers can easily find that the media outlet expressing prejudicial discrimination against China's development, which some Chinese analysts said calls for a forceful response and it make take a long time for CNN to gradually change.

 'Out of turn question'

 At a routine press conference on October 25, CNN reporter David Culver asked Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying an ""out of turn question"" as he groundlessly linked the lorry tragedy in UK with China's development in the past 70 years, and made a veiled mockery of it.

 ""It exposes something in your mind or rather, in the mind of some American media that you represent. What kind of answer did you expect to get from that?"" Hua asked.

 David Culver, a Cuban-American came to China half a year ago, covered the National Day parade, controversy over the NBA related to the Hong Kong riots, carbon emissions and China's economic development.

 Culver's reports frequently uses words like ""Communist Party of China (CPC)"" and ""CPC government,"" a habit similar to US senator Marco Rubio, who is known for his anti-China sentiments. In the US lexicon, these words demonstrate a strong color of Cold War ideology.

 A screenshot shows one of David Culver's tweets on China's National Day refering to the People's Republic of China as communist China.

 Before asking his question, CNN claimed that its live-streaming program, ""39 Chinese people died in British truck"" was cut off and hinted that ""it is the Chinese government blocking information of its own nationals dying overseas."" .

 The groundless assumption is apparently untrue as the UK lorry tragedy was a consistent hot topic online in China which Chinese media followed closely.

 ""I am not surprised at all,"" Zheng Ruolin, a senior Chinese media professional in France told the Global Times in response to Culver's question.

 ""If anything in the world can be connected with China from a negative side, [CNN] will definitely do that. This is not the first time and will not be the last,"" Zheng said.

 CNN not only smears China without doing any investigation, but views China as ""the root of evil"" so they immediately linked the track tragedy to China when the nationality of the 39 dead were revealed, according to Zheng.

 Zheng pointed out that smearing China is vital for Western media as China's image is improving within the global community in developing countries and some Western countries, which is unacceptable for some media.

 Culver's performance reminded people of CNN's incorrect story, ""Hong Kong police using gasoline bombs"" from this summer.

 Although Hong Kong police made it clear that the gasoline bombs were thrown by the rioters, CNN maliciously tampered pictures to make it look as if bombs were thrown from the police.

 CNN finally apologized for the ""wrong reports"" to Hong Kong police in face of facts.

 A screenshot shows David Culver retweets posts of CNN reporter Hadas Gold. The post claims that Culver's live-streaming report of the Exssex tragedy on October 24 was blacked out in China, in contradiction to the facts disseminated online in Chinese. 

 Slander, apology and dirty tricks

 CNN staff violating press ethics, infuriating China, and then correcting themselves and apologizing is nothing new.

 One example is the reporting of the ""March 14 riots"" in Lhasa in 2008. Some Western media including CNN neglected legal regulations and basic social justice. They distorted facts and helped build momentum for separatists in Tibet.

 After CNN intentionally cropped the photograph and used the wrong appellation for the Tibet Autonomous Region, many Chinese netizens criticized CNN on a website called ""anti-CNN.com.""

 Chinese American communities also protested against CNN's reporting which favored Tibetan separatists on purpose.

 CNN later removed the cropped version and put the whole photo which showed separatist Tibetans throwing stones.

 In April 2008, CNN anchor Jack Cafferty made insulting remarks in his program ""The Situation Room."" He said products manufactured in China are ""junk"" and ""I think they're basically the same bunch of goons and thugs they've been for the last 50 years.""

 At the beginning, CNN used chicanery for Cafferty's insulting words, but both the Chinese government and Chinese people demanded an apology from CNN and Cafferty.

 Then Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Jiang Yu said: ""The Chinese people cannot be bullied and humiliated. We once again solemnly urge CNN to seriously deal with the matter, take back the vile remarks and make a sincere apology to all Chinese people.""

 In protest of Cafferty's racist remarks, at least 5,000 Chinese Americans demonstrated in front of the CNN Building in Los Angeles.

 In mid-May 2008, CNN apologized for Cafferty's remarks on China. ""CNN has the highest respect for Chinese people around the world and we have no doubt that there was genuine offense felt by them over the Jack Cafferty commentary. On behalf of CNN I'd like to apologize to the Chinese people for that,"" said then CNN President Jim Walton in a letter to then Chinese ambassador to the United States Zhou Wenzhong.

 A senior staff member at CNN said Cafferty felt sorry.

 Chinese people were not satisfied with CNN and Cafferty's apologies. Many of them urged decisive action.

 Stains around the world

 CNN was founded in 1980. After its coverage of the Persian Gulf War, the network's coverage is regarded as the most influential in the US, and is the second most watched network after Fox News. The channel has often courted controversy, such as incendiary comments that ratcheted up tensions between the US and Iran.

 In January 2006, when CNN reported the speech of then-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, it deliberately translated ""nuclear technology"" as ""nuclear weapon."" CNN quickly issued an apology after Iranian officials issued a warning banning CNN reporters from reporting in Iran.

 ""The Egyptian media will not be surprised by CNN's handling of the case of 39 bodies found in a van heading to UK,"" an official responsible for overseas news report at Egyptian state information service (SIS) told the Global Times, adding that CNN and other Western media often give false reports about Egypt.

 CNN exaggerates the death toll of terrorist attacks in Egypt, especially in the Sinai Peninsula, an area where strict military control makes it difficult for journalists to enter. Also, the legitimate arrest and detention of violent and terrorist suspects in Egypt were described as ""suppressing human rights"" and ""engaging in political purges.""

 ""Although these media reports on Egypt are inaccurate, the Egyptian authorities usually issue statements of refutation by the SIS out of respect for freedom of expression and balance of various aspects. Otherwise there is no better way,"" the official said.

 Not only in the political sphere, CNN's inaccurate news about Egypt also extended to Egyptian professional footballer Mohamed Salah Hamed Mahrous Ghaly. In June 2018, just before the start of the World Cup in Russia, CNN broke a ""shocking news"" that Salah, who has been given honorary citizenship in Russia's Chechnya republic by Ramzan Kadyrov, was about to withdraw from the Egyptian national football team.

 CNN posted a picture showing Salah in the stadium with the head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, alluding that Salah would play for Russia.

 The news was immediately refuted by the press officer of the Egyptian football team and Russia Today.

 The official also gave a case about how to respond to unscrupulous reports by Western media, telling that one of his jobs is to often strike back at some of the Western media's inaccurate reports about Egypt in the first place.

 He mentioned a British newspaper's report of alleged organ theft from a British tourist who died suddenly while on holiday in Egypt. The body of the tourist was returned home with missing organs. However, after checking with Egyptian Civil Affairs Authority and Ministry of Justice, the SIS found out that the allegations of ""organ theft"" were unfounded because samples were taken during autopsy and the heart, parts of the liver, kidneys and other organs had been removed in order to establish the cause of death, with the knowledge of the family.

 To clarify the facts, the SIS issued a statement to registered foreign journalists.

 Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov once joked that CNN was ""fake news"". Lavrov had a brief press conference following his meeting with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, on the sidelines of the Arctic Council in Rovaniemi, Finland in May.

 A screenshot of RT's report on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov joking that CNN is""fake news""

 A CNN reporter asked what ""leverage or opportunities"" Russia had to stop a US military intervention in Venezuela. ""Some call your company CNN 'fake news,' and now you are asking a fake question,"" Lavrov replied, Russia Today reported.

 The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairslisted reports containing fake news on its official website. At least 60 articles were listed, including those from CNN, the New York Times and the Financial Times.

 Russian media also criticized CNN and some other outlets for their double standards on street violence in Hong Kong and Catalonia.

 Some African countries refused to allow CNN reporters to cover elections because of alleged interference in their countries' internal affairs.

 One television host told the Global Times that American viewers who grew up watching CNN knew nothing about the US outside Washington and even less about the world outside the US.

 In January 2018, US President Donald trump and his campaign launched a ""fake news trophy"" contest. CNN accounted for four of the top 10 fake news stories, which were all clarified by other media or corrected by CNN itself.

 　　

 Know their rules

 ""Negative China stories will continue to exist. And the Western media will hype them or try very hard to link some negative news to China and criticize China's political systems,"" Zhang Yiwu, a professor from Peking University, told the Global Times.

 Zhang said that some Western media have a stereotype of China, which is made clear by their anti-China bias.

 The new generation of the Western journalists should get rid of the influence of Sinophobic coverage and get a full picture of China's development, Chinese experts said.

 Although some media distribute fake news and show poor ethics, Chinese people will not reject all reports on China written by Western reporters.

 Zheng said that tarnishing China has become an ""instinct"" of some Western media and it may take a long time to change the impression, as well as a younger generation making an effort to understand China.

"Commentary: Challenging ""one country, two systems"" deserves punishment","BEIJING, Aug. 21 (Xinhua) -- As recent protests and violence took place in Hong Kong, some violent protestors preached ""Hong Kong independence,"" flagrantly offending national dignity, and severely challenging the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle.

 The increasing violent acts of the anti-China rabble-rousers in the region have seriously infringed on the basic rights of the public, and dealt heavy blows to local industries such as aviation, retailing and tourism.

 Some of the rioters blatantly attacked the police, and battered Hong Kong residents and travelers from the mainland, with complete disregard for the damage they have done to the region.

 To implement the ""one country, two systems"" principle, there are three bottom lines that cannot be touched. There is no room for any activity that harms the security of national sovereignty, challenges the power of the central government and the authority of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, or takes advantage of Hong Kong to infiltrate and damage the Chinese mainland.

 If anyone dares to act against the three bottom lines, their political schemes will be met with nothing but complete failure, and they will be held liable accordingly, which is beyond any doubt.

 The lawbreakers who blatantly challenge the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle must be held accountable legally, and those responsible for the orchestration, organization and manipulation of such acts must bear criminal liability.

 All in all, if the anti-China rabble-rousers in Hong Kong continue down the wrong path, what awaits them will be the harshest legal punishment."
Commentary: violence kidnapping HK’s future should not be tolerated,"For the past two months, the violence of radical demonstrators in Hong Kong has escalated, causing more harm to social stability. The Hong Kong police noted that nearly 900 protestors have been arrested so far, while more legal actions will be carried out in an effort to bring the perpetrators to justice. The central government firmly supports the HK SAR government, as well as the actions of the HK police against violence in accordance with the law. The central government also expressed its firm stance on safeguarding national sovereignty, security, development as well as Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability, stressing the importance of stopping violence from stealing the future of Hong Kong.

 It is undeniable that Hong Kong society has various demands, but the public’s biggest concern at the moment is to seek stability and peace, while the most urgent task is to stop the violence and restore order. Some citizens said, ""The violent protest is more terrible than the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong."" They fear that once HK’s reputation is destroyed, it will be hard to restore the city’s former glory. Some believe that if violence and chaos continue, then ""industry in Hong Kong faces bankruptcy, while people may lose their jobs.” Others are concerned for their own safety, saying that they worry they will be beaten if they wear the wrong colour of clothing. Is this the Hong Kong we used to know? Should we tolerate the current chaos in Hong Kong? Shall we let violence destroy the Pearl of the Orient?

 Violence is violence. To solve certain deep-rooted problems in Hong Kong, concerted efforts from all walks of life are key, but violence is never a ""reasonable option."" If people with different political views and demands resort to violence to gain their so-called ""righteousness"", Hong Kong will never be at peace. Those who scream for democracy and freedom while violently infringing on the rights of others and undermining order are actually using democracy and freedom as an excuse to harm society. Any compromise on violence will only encourage more violence. Refusal to accept violence is the bottom line of a society that respects the rule of law.

 The attempts of radical protestors and opposition parties are now crystal clear. Boycotting the amendment of the extradition law was merely an excuse. When the SAR government halted the amendments, the protestors rolled out new demands of “restoring HK, initiating new revolution,” challenging national sovereignty. Their ultimate goal is to paralyze the SAR Government and the Hong Kong police force, push the city into anarchy, and compete with the central government for Hong Kong’s administration. For this purpose, they do not hesitate to use the young as cannon fodder. 

 Seeing this clearly, can we make a concession on such unreasonable, extreme, and bottomless political threats? Can there be any compromise on such a serious challenge to ""one country, two systems""? The answer is an absolute no. ""Any attempt to endanger national sovereignty and security, challenge the power of the central government and the authority of the Basic Law of the HKSAR or use Hong Kong to carry out infiltration and sabotage activities against the mainland is an act that crosses the red line, and is absolutely impermissible."" If anybody thinks that escalating violence will force the central government to make concessions on the matter of principle, then he or she is miscalculated. If there is turmoil in Hong Kong that cannot be controlled by the SAR government, the central government will not sit idly by. In accordance with the law, the central government has enough methods and power to quickly quell any unrest.

 Hong Kong will have a future only when the violence is halted. We must pay tribute to the Hong Kong Police and the public who support Hong Kong’s rule of law. You have defended the foundation of Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, you have protected Hong Kong's position as an international financial, trade and shipping center. You have secured the interests of Hong Kong people and foreign investors. We must say to the young people who have been misled that violence is not the way to show your love for Hong Kong. Your youth should not be used as a political bargaining chip, and you should not be used as a scapegoat or a chess piece. We must also warn all ""anti-China chaos"" forces, that you must not misjudge the situation, you must not underestimate the strong will and determination of the central government and the people of the whole country to safeguard national sovereignty, security and unity, as well as Hong Kong's prosperity and stability."
Is the US to blame for what is going on in Hong Kong?,"The chaos and violence in Hong Kong reached a new and troubling level on Tuesday. Radical protesters at Hong Kong’s airport seized a journalist from the Global Times, bound his hands and feet, and beat him. Images and videos of the extreme violence quickly circulated online, prompting anger in China and around the world.

 These rioters have also thrown gasoline bombs at police and hurt tourists from the Chinese mainland. The shocking footage should serve as a reminder that the protests have devolved into mindless thuggery that goes against every law and regulation in any country and region.

 As the protesters step up violence, it is obvious that what started as a protest against an extradition bill has become much more extreme. Other than lawful and peaceful demonstrations, the protests have gone far beyond their original intent. Chinese officials have pointed out that the situation in Hong Kong has the hallmarks of a “color revolution,” and evidence has emerged that foreign forces have interfered with the situation.

 However, a question being raised is if the US is to blame for what is going on in Hong Kong.

 Some Western media outlets are even claiming that China is blaming the United States and the West for the external interference to cover up internal problems.

 US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that many are blaming him and the United States for the problems going on in Hong Kong, adding that he cannot imagine why.

 Well, not a single US politician has condemned the violence in Hong Kong. Rather, they have fanned the flames by sticking their noses into Hong Kong affairs.

 There is no question that the United States has its hand in what is going on in Hong Kong, though to what extent is hard to measure.

 Last Thursday, reports revealed a meeting between Julie Eadeh, the political unit chief for the US Consulate General in Hong Kong, and leading “Hong Kong Independence” activists. Their meeting in a hotel was captured by a Hong Kong citizen who posted the photo on social media.

 The Trump administration has clearly signaled its support for protesters in Hong Kong. Officials have met with Hong Kong separatists in Washington and Hong Kong; there has been a host of public statements by US politicians and officials; and American flags have become a staple feature of the violent protests.

 Two years ago, when violence broke out in Charlottesville, Virginia, US politicians condemned the violence and some called it terrorism. On the two-year anniversary, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee for 2016, took to social media to remind people about the dangers of violence, calling the person who drove a car into a crowd of people “a neo-Nazi.” However, hours later, in a separate tweet, Clinton called for support of the rioters in Hong Kong. It is a classic example of the double standard the United States applies to China.

 Countries with rule of law have zero tolerance for violence, especially extreme violence, and acts of violence should always be condemned. There is no reason a different standard should apply to China. It is shameful that some US politicians aim to incite chaos in Hong Kong."
Martin Lee's hypocrisy and obsession with stirring up chaos in Hong Kong,"BEIJING, Aug. 21 -- Over the past two months, many opposition figures have been stirring up unlawful rallies, chaos and instability in Hong Kong.

 Among those was Martin Lee Chu-ming, a diehard proxy for foreign anti-China forces.

 A revisit of what Lee has said and done over the past decades showed his long-time antagonism to his own country.

 Before Hong Kong's return to China, Lee actively supported policies by British authorities and begged for external forces' interference.

 Early on in 1988 when he visited the United States, Lee said: ""I believe many will think it is the best that Hong Kong remains a British colony for another 100 years.""

 He even advised the U.S. Congress in 1990 that the United States should enact a set of special policies based on the political wills of a fraction of Hong Kong people.

 During another visit to the United States in 1996, Lee again begged for the U.S. side to meddle in Hong Kong affairs.

 After Hong Kong's successful return to the motherland in 1997, Lee continued his provocation against the ""one country, two systems"" principle and repeatedly attacked the central government in endless China-bashing moves.

 When China was preparing for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Lee, in the Wall Street Journal, asked the United States to use the Games to pressure China for so-called ""human rights.""

 For a long time, Lee has been in close contact with Sinophobia figures in the United States and the United Kingdom, begging and helping Western countries to meddle in Hong Kong affairs and interfere in China's internal affairs.

 Considered to be opposition's so-called ""godfather,"" Lee once said he ""dared to be the running dog for colonialism"" and took advantage of his influence as a member of the Legislative Council (LegCo) and as a barrister to mentor a number of hard-core troublemakers in Hong Kong, including Benny Tai, the mastermind of the 2014 ""Occupy Central"" incident and media tycoon Jimmy Lai Chee-ying, another ""black hand"" behind the city's latest chaos and violence.

 Lee has been trying to exploit the proposed amendments to Hong Kong's ordinances on the transfer of fugitives to stir up chaos by acting as a planner, agitator and organizer of the latest demonstrations and violent protests.

 To that end, he frequently sought foreign intervention on many visits to the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, while colluding with Jimmy Lai to use the media Lai controls to publish a mix of distorted propaganda.

 During his 2019 visit to the United States, Lee begged for U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's support in compelling the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government to withdraw the amendments.

 Martin Lee, Anson Chan Fang On-sang and other opposition figures were found to have secretly met with Julie Eadeh, a diplomat from the U.S. Consulate General in Hong Kong in August who also secretly met with ""Hong Kong independence"" activists including Joshua Wong Chi-fung and Nathan Law Kwun-chung, according to Hong Kong media reports.

 Ironically, it was Lee who first raised the issue of fugitive transfers between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland in 1998 when he was a LegCo member. Then, Lee proposed arrangements for such transfers, citing ""fugitives threaten the peace and stability of Hong Kong.""

 When radical protesters repeatedly paralyzed the airport, vandalized public buildings, blocked roads, obstructed metro lines, besieged police stations and assaulted police officers with hurled bricks, iron bars, corrosive liquids and even petrol bombs, Lee publicly glorified such acts as ""peaceful means"" with ""the admiration of the whole world.""

 While coaxing numerous young people into violence, vandalism and crime, Lee stayed behind the scene and never let younger generations of his family got involved in ""street politics.""

 The ungraceful records of Lee's misleading and deceptive deeds over the years have proven that he remains one of the sources of the current chaos in Hong Kong and a diehard proxy for foreign anti-China forces, disregarding the long-term interests of most Hong Kong people and the whole of China.

 As an old Chinese saying goes, ""those who are busy with wrongdoings will end with self-destruction."" The same warning, undoubtedly, applies to Martin Lee."
Five things to know about Hong Kong's ordinance amendment issue,"HONG KONG, Aug. 23 -- A series of violent activities have plagued Hong Kong since June. The following are five things you need to know about what has happened in Hong Kong.

 1. HOW DID ALL THESE START?

 During their trip to Taipei in February 2018, a then 19-year-old suspect surnamed Chan from Hong Kong allegedly murdered his 20-year-old pregnant girlfriend, also a Hong Kong resident, in Taipei, fled Taiwan and returned to Hong Kong alone.

 The case was complicated for authorities in Hong Kong and Taiwan to handle with the transfer of the fugitive suspect, as Hong Kong has no jurisdiction over the case with the absence of a transfer agreement between Hong Kong and Taiwan.

 The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has agreements with 20 jurisdictions on the surrender of fugitive offenders and 32 jurisdictions over mutual legal assistance in criminal matters around the world.

 To fix the legal loophole, the HKSAR government tabled the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 at the Legislative Council (LegCo) for discussion on April 3.

 The bill was proposed to enable Hong Kong to conduct case-based cooperation with jurisdictions that have no effective long-term arrangement with Hong Kong on juridical assistance in criminal matters.

 The HKSAR government reiterated that the amendments are meant to protect the law-abiding general public in Hong Kong and business activities from the threat of crime.

 The targets of case-based surrenders are fugitives who have committed grave criminal offenses based on prima facie evidence and are wanted for justice due to the offenses committed, and the HKSAR has full discretion as to whether a case-based surrender request should be acceded to, according to the HKSAR government.

 The lack of knowledge of the legal system of the Chinese mainland and the fact that some people stoked fears led to growing public concern over the bill.

 A mass protest against the bill broke out on June 9.

 Despite the government's promise to continue addressing concerns over the bill and repeated calls for rational discussions both at the LegCo and in the community, the LegCo meeting slated on June 12 had to be delayed after protesters repeatedly attempted to storm the LegCo building.

 2. HOW DID HKSAR GOVERNMENT RESPOND?

 While proposing the ordinance amendments, the HKSAR government said it has dealt with the matter with caution, paid close attention to the concerns of the society, and taken concrete steps to ease their concerns.

 Additional human rights protections to the bill were also introduced.

 On June 15, HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced that the HKSAR government would suspend the legislative amendments until further communication and explanation work is completed.

 After the amendments were completely halted, Hong Kong's opposition and some radical forces continued to use the situation to incite anger through a series of more violent protests that sent Hong Kong into chaos.

 They vandalized public facilities, besieged police stations, obstructed metro lines, attacked police officers, beat up people, and caused tremendous turmoil at the Hong Kong International Airport, affecting the normal lives of ordinary Hong Kong people and hundreds of thousands of passengers.

 Some opposition figures and radical protesters went even further to drum up ""Hong Kong independence"" and shouted slogans like ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times.""

 As the situation worsened, the HKSAR government condemned the violent acts, called for law and order, and warned that extreme violence is pushing Hong Kong to a ""very dangerous situation.""

 On Aug. 13, Lam said the most urgent task for Hong Kong at the moment is to stop violence and safeguard the rule of law, to prevent Hong Kong from sinking into ""an abyss and being smashed to pieces.""

 ""Only when all calm down, will genuine dialogue, fixing the rift and restoring social harmony, begin,"" Lam said.

 On Aug. 20, Lam said the HKSAR government would start work immediately on building a platform for dialogue among all walks of life.

 She hoped that all sides could show understanding and respect toward each other, and conduct dialogues openly and directly with people of all classes with different political stances and backgrounds, in a bid to find a way out for Hong Kong.

 3. HOW DID HONG KONG POLICE REACT?

 As protests often evolved into violence and assaults against police officers, Hong Kong police, facing tremendous pressure, had to fire tear gas and used batons to keep law and order on some occasions.

 ""We are responsive. If there are no violent charging at our check lines, no one attacking us, attacking our police station, we are not going to use force to stop it,"" Yeung Man-pun, a police officer of Kowloon City District, said on Aug. 16.

 Over the past two months, radical and violent protesters repeatedly charged against police lines after marches and rallies. They wantonly blocked roads, vandalized public facilities, set fires on streets and in front of police stations, attacked police officers with iron bars, corrosive fluids, hurled bricks and petrol bombs.

 Since early June, about 180 police officers have been injured and police stations were attacked over 75 times.

 Still, police exercised great restraint when handling unlawful protests and only dispersed violent protesters with minimum use of force.

 Chief Superintendent David Jordan said in an interview that the situation on the front line is the most dangerous that he has faced in over 25 years because of the level of aggression and violence.

 Jordan, 52, serves as the Commandant of the Police Tactical Unit, a force for large-scale emergencies.

 ""We have been incredibly restrained, and also we are only reactive,"" Jordan said. ""I strongly feel that the role and the actions of the Hong Kong police have been as tolerant as any other police force on the planet would have been. A lot of other police forces would have acted far more productively and possibly aggressively against this kind of situation.""

 Jordan said the police allow some disruption before they deploy, which is an incredible amount of tolerance for an international city police force.

 The HKSAR government has firmly supported the police, saying the frontline force is under enormous pressure and facing unjust accusations of brutality.

 4. HOW DOES CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SEE IT?

 The central government authorities have demanded order be restored and violence be stopped.

 The criminal activities blatantly challenged the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle and they must be punished by law, said Zhang Xiaoming, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, in early August.

 Like many Hong Kong people have said, the ordinance amendment issue has changed in its essence and bears the features of a ""color revolution.""

 The central authorities firmly support Chief Executive Carrie Lam in leading the HKSAR government's law-based governance, and they have confidence in Lam's wisdom and ability to handle the current situation in Hong Kong and lead the HKSAR government's administrative team to move forward and make further progress, Zhang said.

 China's State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Wednesday said no responsible government or rule-of-law society would tolerate these acts, emphasizing that Hong Kong affairs are China's internal affairs and brook no interference by external forces.

 5. WHAT CONSEQUENCES HAVE BEEN INCURRED?

 Weeks of upheaval has undermined the social order and an already weak economy, with Hong Kong's retail, restaurants and tourism already hit hard.

 The disorder has frayed Hong Kong residents' nerves and made lives difficult. Many small and medium-sized enterprises said they have suffered a 30-percent drop in earnings and pay cuts for employees in recent months, according to a survey.

 The number of travelers to Hong Kong also dropped markedly. Nearly 30 countries or regions have issued travel warnings to Hong Kong.

 The HKSAR government revised downward the real economic growth forecast for 2019 as a whole to 0 to 1 percent, from an earlier estimate of 2 to 3 percent.

 The risk of an economic downturn in Hong Kong is significantly rising in the face of internal and external difficulties, said Paul Chan, HKSAR government financial secretary.

 Investor confidence has been dampened, and companies have postponed plans of initial public offerings in Hong Kong.

 On Aug. 15, the HKSAR government rolled out a package of measures to support enterprises and relieve people's financial burden, which will cost about 19.1 billion HK dollars (about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars).

 ""The Hong Kong economy is facing the risk of a downturn. We can see this from the data in the first half,"" said Lam, adding that the data in the first half has not fully reflected the severity of the problem."
Hong Kong public show support for police in strictly enforcing law,"HONG KONG, July 29 -- A number of civil groups in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Monday showed their support for the police, hoping that they continue to work hard to enforce the law and maintain the order and security of Hong Kong.

 ""The police have been striving to protect our safety amid the series of violent demonstrations that happened recently in Hong Kong, which is not easy,"" Hong Kong resident Chow said outside the Western Police Station, where he joined his friends to show support for the police.

 ""We are here to support the police in strictly enforcing the law, getting rid of bullies and bringing peace to law-abiding people,"" Chow added.

 Jack Shun, a friend of Chow, said that he was very angry about the illegal rallies and protests that took place over the weekend.

 ""Why did those violent protesters throw bricks to the police? We have had enough! We don't want to see the police get hurt,"" Shun said indignantly, adding that he wanted to see Hong Kong stay stable and prosperous.

 A number of civil groups also gathered at the Hong Kong Police Force headquarters to show their support.

 More than 30 members from Defend Hong Kong Campaign rallied in front of the police headquarters, holding national flags and flags of Hong Kong SAR, raising banners and placards with slogans expressing their gratitude and support for the police.

 Kenny Po, president of Defend Hong Kong Campaign, told reporters that the police have been doing their utmost in fulfilling their duties in order to maintain social order.

 Po praised the police for taking appropriate actions promptly to restore order when facing violence by arresting some violent protesters.

 ""We will continue to support the police in enforcing the law strictly and arresting those opposition legislators who have been instigating the youth to stage illegal protests and commit violence,"" Po said.

 Retired Hong Kong resident Yiu Wing Wah were among a group of people at the police headquarters, presenting placards with slogans including ""well done!"", ""keep it up!"" and ""protect Hong Kong"" to express support for the police.

 ""We are here to express our consolation for the police and to show support for them in continuing to enforce the law and maintain the order and security of Hong Kong,"" Yiu said.

 ""Our demand is very simple, that is to see stability and prosperity in Hong Kong, and no more damage,"" the 74-year-old said, adding that the violent protesters blocked the roads and disrupted normal businesses, which not only damaged the rule of law, but also affected Hong Kong's economy.

 Meanwhile, some Hong Kong residents also went to the Central Police Station to show their support for the police on Monday."
Vice-premier urges HK to halt violence,"Vice-Premier Han Zheng on Wednesday said that ending the violence that has gripped Hong Kong for nearly five months remains the special administrative region's top priority and is the shared responsibility of the SAR's executive, legislative and judicial authorities.

 Han said the central government will continue its unswerving support for the SAR government and its police force to end the violence, and restore the city's law and order, as ""no country or region in the world"" would tolerate such extremely destructive acts.

 Han, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, made the remarks during a meeting with Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor in Beijing on Wednesday.

 It was the first public meeting between Han and Lam since the protests broke out in June. It followed President Xi Jinping's meeting with Lam in Shanghai on Monday, in which Xi affirmed Lam's work in dealing with the unrest, and expressed confidence in her administration.

 In Han's opening remarks before a closed-door meeting, he reaffirmed the central government's high degree of trust in and appreciation for Lam, as well as confidence in the SAR government and the Hong Kong Police Force in dealing with what he described as the ""most severe situation"" since the city's return to the motherland.

 Bottom line

 He said radical separatists' disruptive acts have trampled the city's rule of law and challenged the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle, undermining the overall interests of Hong Kong.

 Stressing that ending the violence should be the consensus of the whole of society, Han also expressed confidence in Lam's administration in taking effective measures to resolve housing and other livelihood issues.

 The SAR government will always have the central government's firm support in maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, Han said.

 He also pointed to the decision passed during just-concluded Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, in which the Party emphasized the importance of strictly upholding the national Constitution and the Basic Law in governing the HKSAR, as well as establishing a legal system in the SAR to safeguard national security. It shows the central government's unswerving stance and confidence in implementing the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Han said.

 Expressing thanks for the central government's firm support, Lam pledged that the SAR government will firmly uphold the ""one country, two systems"" principle and the rule of law to stop the violence.

 Lam said she's very saddened to see that one-third of the over 3,000 arrested during the protests are students and that the financial hub's positive momentum in economic development is undergoing a heavy blow. She said the SAR government is determined to end the violence and provide a peaceful environment.

 Also attending the meeting were State Council Executive Deputy Secretary-General Ding Xuedong, Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council Zhang Xiaoming, and Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR Wang Zhimin.

 Shared responsibility

 Hong Kong Barrister and Legislator Priscilla Leung Mei-fun agreed that the city's executive, legislative and judicial organs share responsibility in quelling violence. She said the work of those bodies is never separated in city governance. Under the spirit of the Basic Law, the three parties should complement each other and maintain checks and balances on each other's functions, she added.

 Given the protracted violence, concerted efforts from the whole of society, especially from the three governing forces, are much needed in bringing Hong Kong back on track, Leung said.

 Lau Siu-Kai, vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, a leading think tank on Hong Kong affairs, said recognition from the central government will help boost the morale of the embattled police, supporting them in withstanding social unrest.

 Appreciating the central government's resolution to maintain ""one country, two systems"", Leung urged the SAR government to put greater emphasis on ensuring the public has a correct understanding of the policy.

 She said the unrest has shown that some Hong Kong people, including youngsters, civil servants and judicial officers, lack a thorough and comprehensive understanding of the concept's essence."
Arson spree targets HK MTR stations,"Fire rages at an exit of the Hong Kong subway's Central Station after masked rioters went on an arson spree on Sunday. [PHOTO/CHINA DAILY]

 Riotous protesters wreaked havoc on the streets of Hong Kong for the 14th consecutive weekend, again targeting MTR stations, including Central Station in the heart of Hong Kong Island, where fires were started at several entrances and windows smashed.

 The protests on Saturday and Sunday came despite Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor's announcement earlier in the week that the extradition law amendment bill, which has sparked more than three months of oftentimes violent demonstrations, will be withdrawn — one of the protesters' main demands.

 Rioters turned the prime Central business district into a battlefield on Sunday, starting multiple fires on the streets and at various MTR station entrances with cardboards and barricades, and smashing windows with metal rods. Plumes of smoke were seen engulfing an exit at Central MTR station, blocking all traffic in the vicinity.

 Protesters also wrecked the station with bricks pried from street pavements, sprayed offensive graffiti on its exterior, and blocked some of its exits with piles of trash.

 Pedestrians were caught in violent clashes between radical mobs and police. One man was beaten up, his heading bleeding, after he collided with fleeing protesters, who also terrorized passersby for videotaping their acts of violence.

 Violence also erupted inside metro stations as rioters destroyed facilities and provoked clashes with riot police by swearing at them. As of 10:30pm on Sunday, Central and Wan Chai MTR stations on Hong Kong Island, as well Prince Edward and Mong Kok stations in Kowloon, were forced to close. Protesters also descended on the busy shopping district of Causeway Bay, where police fired volleys of tear gas to disperse them. Several arrests were made.

 MTR Corp, which operates the city's railway system, strongly condemned the indiscriminate vandalism at metro stations, saying the protesters' behavior had threatened the safety of passengers and MTR staff.

 In a statement issued on Sunday night, the company said one of its employees was injured after being struck by a hard object hurled by protesters.

 Earlier, masked, black-clad protesters had marched from an authorized rally at Charter Garden in Central to the US Consulate, calling on the United States to ""intervene in the crisis"".

 Mobs also gathered outside Mong Kok Police Station on Sunday evening, pointing laser beams at the building and chanting anti-police slogans.

 As of 11 pm, the police had conducted three operations to disperse the protesters. Online footage shows police arresting several rioters during the operation, although it's not known how many people were arrested.

 On Saturday, violence again erupted in various areas of Kowloon and the New Territories. Crowds of rioters besieged Tung Chung MTR Station and vandalized ticket vending machines, while others attacked police officers inside a Sha Tin mall, started fires and blocked off roads in Mong Kok.

 MTR Corp issued an open letter on Sunday, saying it's facing its most serious challenge in its 40 years of operation.

 It urged people from all walks of life to cherish and protect the railway network which, it said, has been part of the collective memories of Hong Kong people for decades.

 On Wednesday, Lam formally withdrew the extradition bill to ""allay public concerns and provide a basis for dialogue"" in a city that has been embroiled in months-long unrest and in dire need of reconciliation.

 The chief executive also appointed two new members to the city's police watchdog body, the Independent Police Complaints Council, and pledged to start a direct dialogue with all sectors across the political spectrum, and an independent review of the city's deep-rooted problems."
"Leaders of political groups advocating ""independence"" taken to court: police","HONG KONG, Aug. 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police have confirmed that Joshua Wong Chi-fung and Agnes Chow Ting, leaders of Demosisto advocating ""Hong Kong's independence,"" were taken to court Friday.

 Tse Chun-chung, chief superintendent of police public relations branch, said that at a daily press conference Friday.

 Wong was arrested on Friday morning on charges of ""inciting others to participate in unauthorized gatherings,"" ""organizing unauthorized gatherings"" and ""knowingly participating in unauthorized gatherings.""

 Chow was arrested on charges of ""inciting others to participate in unauthorized gatherings"" and ""knowingly participating in unauthorized gatherings.""

 According to the press conference, the police also on Thursday evening detained Andy Chan Ho-tin on charges of rioting and assaulting a police officer. Chan was the leader of Hong Kong National Party, a political group that has been announced illegal by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government.

 Tse said the police have been investigating offenses in protests over the past two months and have made seven new arrests since Thursday evening, with suspects involved in the besiegement of the Hong Kong Legislative Council and Police headquarters, or other violent incidents.

 ""We take a zero-tolerance approach to all violent incidents and all arrests were made based on enough evidence,"" Tse said.

 As violence has intensified, the police have become one of the targets of violent demonstrators as 20 police stations and 131 police vehicles have been damaged by them to varied extent as far, Tse said.

 With a large proportion of forces deployed to handle violent incidents, Hong Kong police were short of officers to respond to regular emergency calls.

 Tse said 324, 220, 180 cases in August, July and June respectively, although still a small share of all, exceeded the response time limit as promised by Hong Kong police, which are nine minutes in Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, and 15 minutes in New Territories.

 The cases with longer response time were mainly on weekends, Tse added."
Hong Kong's business environment tarnished by protests,"A passenger takes the Star Ferry from Hong Kong Island to Tsim Sha Tsui in Hong Kong, south China, Aug. 18, 2019. Hong Kong's favorable international image and business environment has been tarnished as violent and disruptive protests have been going on for more than two months. The disturbance's direct and negative effects on the economy are visible in the retail, catering and tourism industries, which have to resort to layoffs amid the sharp declines in sales, customer numbers and revenue. In the June-July period, average earnings for tourism workers plunged by 74 percent, while the number of tours in Hong Kong fell 74 percent on average, according to a survey by the Hong Kong Tour Guides General Union.

Hong Kong's status as int'l financial hub should be cherished,"HONG KONG, Aug. 28 -- Hong Kong's favorable international image and business environment has been tarnished as violent and disruptive protests have been going on for more than two months.

 The disturbance's direct and negative effects on the economy are visible in the retail, catering and tourism industries, which have to resort to layoffs amid the sharp declines in sales, customer numbers and revenue.

 Rioters repeatedly vandalized public facilities, besieged police stations, obstructed metro lines, attacked police officers and beat up people who held different views.

 Tremendous turmoil was also caused at the Hong Kong International Airport after radical protesters paralyzed one of the world's busiest airports in early August, affecting the lives of ordinary Hong Kong people and hundreds of thousands of passengers.

 Alarmingly, some extreme and radical protesters even took on Hong Kong's hard-won position as an international financial center by inciting runs on banks, sowing fears and battering investors' confidence in the equity markets.

 As a result, many companies from the Chinese mainland and other parts of the world have suspended or delayed plans for initial public offerings (IPOs) in Hong Kong, a warning sign that should be noted by those who love Hong Kong.

 Since its return to China in 1997, Hong Kong has consolidated its status as an international financial center, with one of the world's most active and liquid securities markets due to the free flow of capital and favorable tax policies on capital gains and dividend incomes.

 Hong Kong overtook New York to become the world's top IPO market in 2018.

 As a testing ground of China's financial opening-up, Hong Kong has become the world's largest offshore RMB business center, with stock and bond connects between Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen.

 Charles Li, chief executive of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd., said the volatility of Hong Kong's equity market has increased in recent days.

 He said the impact of the current violent protests has not yet been clearly revealed in the market, warning its long-term effect on Hong Kong's economy and the market could be very far-reaching and much broader.

 The financial services sector remains one of Hong Kong's most important economic pillars, accounting for 18.9 percent of the city's GDP and providing about 7 percent of job opportunities in 2017.

 Given the financial sector's broader role in the economy, any disruptive moves or attempts to damage the financial sector in Hong Kong would jeopardize the vital interests of global financial institutions and hundreds of thousands of investors.

 Paul Chan, financial secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government, warned the deteriorating external environment and the continued violent protests in Hong Kong are creating an ""economic typhoon"", citing aggregate unemployment rate of the retail, accommodation and food services sectors has risen from 3.4 percent at the start of the year to 4.3 percent, with 27,500 unemployed.

 Chan stressed the financial risks in Hong Kong are controllable, with its capital adequacy ratio and liquidity coverage ratio in the banking system much higher than international standards, but the HKSAR government would continue to monitor the market to prevent possible risks.

 Rampant acts of violence must be stopped and order must be restored in order to cherish Hong Kong's financial status as an international financial center."
"Twitter, Facebook abuse media freedom in reporting about Hong Kong","Twitter and Facebook abused the freedom of the press when they chose to crack down on accounts originating from the Chinese mainland sharing information on China and Hong Kong.

 Reports confirmed that the two social media platforms have blocked nearly 1,000 accounts for their reports about Hong Kong, for reasons such as the fact they are associated with the government, deliver exaggerated information about Hong Kong, and undermine the legitimacy of protests in Hong Kong.

 A close look at the blocked accounts will reveal that they provide information about how violence damaged Hong Kong's social order, and rioters attacked police officers in Hong Kong.

 Unsurprisingly, Chinese youths use their own methods to care for and support Hong Kong on social media platforms.

 Twitter and Facebook have directly pierced the mist that shrouded the so-called Western press freedom, telling the world that there is no true freedom and no truth that's objective, neutral and rational, but information control that serves a specific country, information blocking and filtering following ideological stereotypes, and ideological competition.

 In the wake of the turmoil in Iran to overthrow the government, members of the US State Department directly called the Twitter founder, asking the social network to postpone system upgrading to ensure that Iranian street activists could continue to organize activities via Twitter.

 The fact that some core members of the former US State Department's 21st Century Statecraft joined Twitter and became responsible for Twitter's international strategy proves that Twitter is not so much a media platform as it is the US State Department's royal media that uses social media to interfere in other countries' internal affairs.

 Twitter, led by its founder Jack Dorsey, acted as a pioneer in consolidating American cyberspace hegemony. Similarly, Facebook's move is, to a large extent, based on the rule that America is politically correct.

 As early as September 2018, two Oxford University researchers analyzed 1.1 million tweets written in Chinese and found a large number of anti-China texts were generated through the use of automated robot programs. These tweets constructed ""anti-China cyberspace.""

 Twitter's latest move has further confirmed the results of the previous study: if content released meets Twitter's pre-set ideological standards and is in the national interest of the US, Twitter will adopt a relatively loose attitude; if the content does not meet the requirements, then Twitter will remove it following procedures that are ""scientific, normative, open, fair"" as it calls.

 On the Hong Kong issue, Twitter's standards are evident: those accounts supporting the rioters are regarded as in line with Twitter's standards, while those supporting the Hong Kong police are removed.

 The so-called freedom of the press, in such cases, has become a napkin to erase traces of US hegemony, wipe away the brutal behaviors of rioters and cover the selfishness and self-righteousness of Western centralism. To cope with the anxiety caused by China's development, the US has gone wild, which will only accelerate its decline.

 No country can change the fact that Hong Kong belongs to China, and no country can block the historical process of China's development. Any external forces, be it Twitter or Facebook, or the powers behind them, will be remembered by history."
"Hong Kong media applaud first community dialogue between gov't officials, residents","HONG KONG, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government held its first community dialogue on Thursday evening, which local media saw as a first step to ease social tension and restore public confidence.

 HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam and four secretaries of the HKSAR government had candid talks with about 130 representatives of the public at Queen Elizabeth Stadium in Wan Chai on Thursday.

 An editorial carried by the Wen Wei Po said that Hong Kong society was seriously torn apart by the prolonged violent protests. Under such circumstances, the HKSAR government showed its sincerity and willingness to shoulder responsibility by listening to different voices and even harsh criticism, which was the first step to replace confrontation with communication, and bridge the rift through dialogue.

 The Hong Kong Commercial Daily pointed out in an opinion piece that people in Hong Kong, after months of chaos and violence, wished for restoration of social order. The dialogue was a good way to ease social tensions, and could help rebuild public confidence.

 According to a commentary by the Sing Tao Daily, stopping violence and enhancing dialogue are the constructive measures for Hong Kong's future development. It saw the dialogue as a platform where people could exchange ideas and think in others' position, something that could never be achieved by using violence.

 It was noted in the commentary that the biggest problem in Hong Kong currently was radical violence that undermined the rule of law, hurt local economy and affected people's normal life. Only through dialogue could Hong Kong find a solution.

 Hong Kong Economic Times said in an editorial that the community dialogue was a first step to ease social tension, adding that the HKSAR government should show its sincerity, determination and capability with real action.

 In early September, Lam made a televised speech, proposing four actions to turn around the current difficult situation, including to initiate community dialogues starting this month."
Commissioner's office of Chinese foreign ministry opposes interference in Hong Kong affairs by British politicians,"HONG KONG, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- The Office of Commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) expressed on Friday strong disapproval of and firm opposition against the interference in Hong Kong affairs by British politicians in a statement.

 The statement came in response to the unwarranted remarks about Hong Kong made by a certain British senior government official and a report issued by the Foreign Affairs Committee of Britain's House of Commons.

 The spokesperson of the commissioner's office said that the politicians have flagrantly interfered in China's internal affairs, and trampled upon international law and basic norms governing international relations.

 As violence is wreaking havoc on Hong Kong, it is the common wish of people that the rioters will be held accountable, and the violence and chaos stopped, the spokesperson said.

 Some British politicians, however, have run counter to the mainstream public opinion in Hong Kong, confounded the rioter's bloody crime with the police's law enforcement efforts, glorified outright pre-election violence as ""peaceful protest"" and ""a stepping stone to political dialogue"", and smeared Hong Kong's legal system, the spokesperson said.

 “They have openly defended Joshua Wong, a political crown clamoring for so-called ‘Hong Kong independence,’ who seriously challenges the red line of ‘one country, two systems’ and undermines Hong Kong's prosperity and stability,” the spokesperson said.

 The spokesperson said people cannot help but wondering whether these politicians would only be content to see Hong Kong plunged into the abyss of despair.

 “The central government, the SAR government, our compatriots in Hong Kong and international forces for justice will never ever let them have their way,” the spokesperson said.

 The spokesperson urged Britain to honor its commitment to support ""one country, two systems"" and oppose ""Hong Kong independence"" with concrete actions, make a clean break from anti-China troublemakers in Hong Kong, and stop endorsing the evil."
China voices firm opposition to G7 statement on Hong Kong,"BEIJING, Aug. 27 (Xinhua) -- China on Tuesday voiced strong dissatisfaction with and resolute opposition to ""random accusations"" and ""irresponsible remarks"" on Hong Kong affairs in a statement from the Group of Seven (G7) summit.

 Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang made the remarks at a daily press briefing.

 The G7 reportedly reaffirmed the existence and the importance of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong and called for avoiding violence in a joint statement issued Monday at the end of a G7 summit held in Biarritz, France.

 ""As we have emphasized on many occasions, Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs, and no foreign governments, organizations or individuals have the right to intervene,"" said Geng, when responding to a query about China's comment on the statement from the G7 summit.

 The demonstrations and violent protests have been running in Hong Kong for more than two months, and Hong Kong's rule of law, social order, economy and wellbeing of the people, as well as its international image have been severely impacted as a result, Geng said.

 ""No one cares more about Hong Kong's prosperity and stability than Chinese people, including residents of Hong Kong,"" Geng said. ""(Those) are our own affairs, we will handle them well. G7 members should not poke their noses into others' business with ill-harbored intentions and conspiracies.""

 On the aforementioned Joint Declaration between China and Britain, Geng said its ultimate goal and core content were to make sure China would take back Hong Kong in 1997 and the government of the People's Republic of China would resume its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong with effect from July 1, 1997.

 ""Since Hong Kong returned to the motherland in 1997, the Chinese government has exercised jurisdiction over Hong Kong according to the Constitution and the Basic Law,"" he said. ""Based on international law and basic norms governing international relations, no other country or organization is entitled to meddle in Hong Kong affairs under the pretext of the Joint Declaration."""
Man set afire as rioters escalate violence in HK,"Hong Kong witnessed one of the most disturbing incidents on Monday amid the ongoing protests that first erupted in mid-June, as a man was set on fire by a masked radical.

 As seen in a video circulating online, the man's clothing was ignited by a radical protester after he was doused with what is believed to be an accelerant as he quarreled with several others on a footbridge in Ma On Shan, New Territories.

 During the confrontation, the man, wearing a green shirt, argued with the protesters and told them they were all Chinese, the video showed.

 He ended up suffering severe burns and is in critical condition in a hospital. The attacker is believed to have escaped.

 Earlier, the green-shirted man was seen trying to stop some protesters from vandalizing Ma On Shan MTR Station, another video showed.

 Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor stressed on Monday that the SAR government will not yield to the violence of rioters and accede to their demands. The rioters will never succeed, she said.

 ""If there's still any wishful thinking that by escalating violence, the Hong Kong SAR government will yield to pressure to satisfy the so-called political demands, I'm making this statement loud and clear here — this will not happen,"" Lam said.

 She made the remark while addressing a news briefing after citywide riots caused dozens of injuries among residents on Monday.

 Lam reiterated that violence will not provide any solution to the current problems of Hong Kong. She called on all people in Hong Kong, regardless of their political views, to agree that the priority was to stop the violence and restore calm in the city as soon as possible.

 In a news conference on Monday afternoon, police confirmed the attack on the man and called it ""inhumane"".

 Strongly condemning the attack, a police representative criticized the suspect for ""disregarding the life of others to make a political stand"".

 Police are investigating the case. As of 6 pm Monday, no one had yet been arrested, police said.

 The attack was condemned by prominent figures. Solicitor Kennedy Wong Ying-ho said the incident is ""absolutely shocking"" as the radical attacked someone who did not even have any physical conflict with him.

 He noted that the perpetrator could be charged with attempted murder, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

 Lau Siu-kai, vice-president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, told China Daily that the incident showed that the emotionally driven radicals, often armed with dangerous items, posed a grave danger to unarmed citizens.

 Urging the rioters to show more respect for others' safety, Lau also called for more powerful and effective measures from authorities to quell violence and uphold public safety.

 Fresh round of violence

 Hong Kong suffered a fresh round of violent unrest on Monday as protesters attacked and vandalized numerous public facilities, subway stations and university campuses.

 Besides setting fires at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, they also vandalized facilities at Hong Kong Baptist University where they targeted shops such as Pacific Coffee and a school canteen owned by restaurant chain Maxim's.

 Pacific Coffee is owned by a mainland group, and the eldest daughter of Maxim's founder recently voiced opposition to violence by the protesters.

 On Monday morning, two gasoline bombs were thrown into a train car full of passengers at Kwai Fong Station.

 The protesters also hurled gasoline bombs into Tung Chung Station and set fires in Heng On Station.

 Twenty-five MTR stations had to shut down temporarily and several metro lines suspended service, MTR Corp said in a statement.

 Because of the mayhem on Monday, nearly all universities in the city suspended classes."

 HONG KONG, Aug. 8 (Xinhua) -- A group of Hong Kong residents gathered on Thursday morning at a pier of the Victoria Harbor to express their reverence to the Chinese national emblem and flag.

 To the music of ""Ode to the Motherland,"" they unfurled several Chinese national flags and waved banners that read ""safeguarding the national dignity.""

 Later, they sang the national anthem of China in unison, drawing attention and acclaim from a large crowd of passers-by in a luxury shopping district in Tsim Sha Tsui of the Kowloon Peninsula.

 ""As Chinese, we were all saddened by recent acts of insulting the national emblem and flag,"" said the organizer of the gathering, who only gave his surname Lim. ""We won't allow anyone to tarnish our national image.""

 Over the past several days, radical protesters twice removed the Chinese national flags from the flagpole at the pier and flung the flags into the water.

 ""A national flag represents the dignity of a country. These insulting acts drew an outpouring of anger from all Chinese,"" said an elderly participant named Hsui Kit Fan.

 During a demonstration in July, some radical protesters besieged the building of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and defaced the national emblem.

 ""We were all furious over the recent incidents of insulting our national emblem and flag. These kinds of acts should never be tolerated,"" said another participant surnamed Wong.

 Wong said many of her family members are working in the police force and she felt heartsore to see them work day and night to keep public order.

 ""I hope the chaotic situation will subside and we can get back to our normal days as soon as possible,"" she said.

 In a statement issued by the participants, they called on the law enforcement agencies of Hong Kong to swiftly bring the perpetrators who insulted the national emblem and flag to justice.

 ""The perpetrators must face severe punishment. This is the only way to prevent the situation from getting worse,"" said the statement.

 Over the past two months, protests in Hong Kong have escalated into a spate of violent incidents, threatening social order and endangering public safety.

 Hong Kong is facing the most severe situation since its return to the motherland, said Zhang Xiaoming, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, on Wednesday.

 ""The most pressing and overriding task at present is to stop violence, end the chaos and restore order, so as to safeguard our homeland and prevent Hong Kong from sinking into an abyss,"" Zhang said."

The Hong Kong police said Friday that a total of 18 people have been arrested for unlawful assemblies and violent acts at the Hong Kong International Airport on Aug. 13 and Sept. 1. (Xinhua/Mao Siqian)

 HONG KONG, Sept. 6 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong police said Friday that a total of 18 people have been arrested for unlawful assemblies and violent acts at the Hong Kong International Airport on Aug. 13 and Sept. 1.

 Lau Wing-kei, deputy district commander of Airport District of the Hong Kong police, said at a media briefing that 12 people have been arrested related to the violent incidents at the airport on Aug. 13.

 The offenses of them, aged between 17 and 35, include unlawful assemblies, false imprisonment, participating in riots, disorder in public places, assaulting police, wounding, possession of offensive weapons and others.

 The airport was paralyzed two days in a row as protesters flooded into the passenger terminal to stage a sit-in protest on Aug. 13, Lau said, adding that the protest quickly turned confrontational and violent as protesters unlawfully blocked passengers from boarding flights and harshly attacked some innocent visitors.

 In relation to the incidents at the airport on Sept. 1, six people, aged between 20 and 26, have been arrested over offenses such as possession of instrument fit for unlawful purposes and intentionally endangering the safety of passengers by throwing objects upon railways.

 Pointing out that ""the disruptive acts have extended to different transport hubs including the Hong Kong International Airport,"" Lau said the police are aware that some of the online comments are promoting another protest at the airport on Saturday by obstructing traffic to and around the airport.

 The airport authority has obtained an injunction order from the court to restrain people from unlawfully and willfully obstructing or interfering with the proper use of the airport.

 Lau reiterated that anyone in breach of the order is liable to the offense of contempt of court, and the police will fully support and provide all necessary assistance to the airport authority in enforcing the injunction order as well as access control measures at the airport.

 Besides the injunction, the airport authority started access control measures for the terminal buildings at the airport on Aug. 14. Only passengers with a valid air ticket or boarding pass for a flight in the next 24 hours and a valid travel document, or airport staff with relevant identification document will be allowed to enter the terminal buildings.

 Lau said the police noticed that some netizens talked about making fake tickets to pretend as passengers to enter the terminal, and warned that this may constitute the offense of using a false instrument, with a maximum penalty of 14-year imprisonment.

 Lau stressed that the injunction order also covers the roads connecting to the airport, and if drivers intentionally drive slowly to obstruct traffic, they may be liable to careless driving and dangerous driving under the road traffic ordinance.

 ""The airport is an essential infrastructure catering to travelers from all around the world,"" he said, ""The police will closely monitor the situation and make respective deployment tomorrow."""
China slashes British foreign secretary's Hong Kong comments,"BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- China on Wednesday expressed strong dissatisfaction with and firm opposition to the recent comments on Hong Kong made by British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, urging him to stop wanton interference in Hong Kong affairs.

 ""He seems to be fantasizing in the faded glory of British colonialism and obsessed with the bad habit of criticizing and lecturing on other countries' affairs condescendingly,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said at a daily press briefing.

 Geng said China has lodged stern representations with Britain over Hunt's comments.

 According to The Times, Hunt said on Tuesday that he expected China to honor the Sino-British Joint Declaration, a treaty signed in 1984 when Margaret Thatcher was the prime minister, and that ""there will be serious consequences if that internationally binding legal agreement were not to be honored.""

 Geng said as Hong Kong returned to the motherland, the rights and obligations of the British side under the Joint Declaration were completely fulfilled.

 On July 1, 1997, China resumed sovereignty over Hong Kong and the Chinese government started administering it in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law, said Geng.

 ""The British side has no sovereignty over Hong Kong, nor does it have administrative power or supervisory power since its return. It has no so-called responsibility for Hong Kong at all,"" said Geng, calling it ""sheer delusion with mawkish sentimentality"" for the British side to ""consider itself as a guardian.""

 ""It is just shameless to say that the freedom of Hong Kong residents is negotiated for them by the British side,"" Geng said.

 Geng said he wanted to remind Hunt that Hong Kong had no democracy at all during the British colonial rule, and the Hong Kong people had not even the rights to take to the streets to protest.

 It is the Chinese government that protects Hong Kong people's rights of democracy and freedom in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law and fully implements the principles of ""one country, two systems,"" Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong and a high degree of autonomy, said Geng.

 In response to Hunt's remarks that the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) should not use the storming of the region's Legislative Council (LegCo) Complex by demonstrators as a pretext to ""repress"" its people, Geng said Hunt was calling black white by saying so as the storming of the LegCo Complex on July 1 was severe violation of law, Geng said.

 Stressing that Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs that brook no foreign interference, Geng said China advises Britain, especially Hunt, to stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs as it is doomed to fail."
"HK's future lies with China, not the West: Martin Jacques","As protests in Hong Kong continue, scholars and experts worldwide have expressed their concern over the city's economic recession and rising violence. During an exclusive interview with People's Daily Online, Martin Jacques, a senior fellow at Cambridge University, called for restored stability and order in Hong Kong, adding that its future lies only with China.

 Jacques explained that there is a difference between the original peaceful demonstrations and attacks on police and innocent people, further noting that stability and order should be restored to ensure Hong Kong's future development.

 Jacques' comments came after the protests in Hong Kong evolved into extreme violence, with some radicals ransacking the Legislative Council building, assaulting the police, forcing a shutdown of the Hong Kong airport with unauthorized rallies and beating up innocent people.

 ""I think it's very important for them to see their future in terms of the relationship with China and ‘one country, two systems,' because HK is now part of China, and it offers an enormous opportunity. Certainly, a section of the young people in Hong Kong seem to think that China is not the way forward... and I think they are quite mistaken in this."" said Jacques.

 According to Jacques, Hong Kong should consider itself a part of China's development, while initiatives such as the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area could help Hong Kong tackle its economic shortages, securing its future development.

 ""Hong Kong could try to be a part of what's happening in Southern China. It can get involved, even become leaders in some area, but a positive relationship with the Chinese mainland should be maintained. Otherwise, Hong Kong will simply become increasingly less important, and in some way relatively marginalized, and that will be a very bad situation,"" said Jacques.

 The British scholar has also criticized support from western countries, especially the UK, for the demonstration. He noted that such supportive opinions are irresponsible, while the violence of the demonstration has often been ignored.

 ""If these demonstrations were taking place in the United Kingdom, the reaction would be completely different. This is a fundamental hypocrisy in the western attitude,"" adding that the British government has been irresponsible because it was originally party to the agreement of ""one country, two systems.""

 ""One of the great problems in Hong Kong when I lived there was the huge ignorance about China. They didn't look north; they look west. In this sense, young opinions in Hong Kong are quite unusual in East-Asia, as East Asia countries are turning towards China in terms of their future, except Hong Kong,"" said Jacques.

 ""The future of Hong Kong is not with Britain; Britain is in serious decline. Why are the young [in Hong Kong] thinking that the future for them is some kind of restoration with the West? There needs to be a big shift in attitudes within Hong Kong, and they should open their eyes to what China is,"" added Jacques."
14 accused of violating mask ban in Hong Kong,"HONG KONG, Oct. 8 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen people were on Tuesday accused of wearing face masks in protests, the second group of violators under arrest after the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) enacted the anti-mask law in an effort to curb escalating violence.

 The West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts held the trial against those suspects, who, along with 12 other people, were also charged of participating in riot near Hennessy Road, Wan Chai on Sunday.

 The HKSAR government on Friday invoked the power under the Emergency Regulations Ordinance and put in place the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation as a deterrent to rioters, most of whom have used masks to conceal their identities. Two people were indicted for violating the new law on Monday.

 A male biting off a police officer's finger during a violent protest in Sha Tin on July 14 appeared in court again on Tuesday. He faced four charges including assaulting police and wounding, after adjustment by the prosecutor."
Airport Authority Hong Kong obtains interim injunction to restrain interfering with proper use of airport,"HONG KONG, Aug. 14 -- Airport Authority Hong Kong on Wednesday said that they have obtained an interim injunction to restrain persons from unlawfully and willfully obstructing or interfering with the proper use of Hong Kong International Airport.

 The authority emphasized that persons are also restrained from attending or participating in any demonstration or protest or public order event in the airport other than in the area designated by the airport authority.

 The interim injunction expressly provides that nothing in the interim injunction shall be construed as authorizing any demonstration, protest or public order event contrary to the Public Order Ordinance.

 The airport authority is in the process of obtaining sealed copies of the interim injunction and will publish it upon obtaining the copies.

 Some protesters have been holding unauthorized public assemblies at the airport since Aug. 9 and seriously obstructed to the operation of the airport on Aug. 12 and 13, causing a lot of flight cancellations."
HK vows swift action against violence,"Hong Kong police officers pledge to take swift action against any street violence or other illegal activities in Hong Kong, on Sept 20, 2019. [Photo/Xinhua] 

 Hong Kong police on Friday called for calm and pledged to take swift action against any street violence or other illegal activities, irrespective of offenders' backgrounds or views.

 The vow came as some protesters engaged in violent confrontations last weekend, resulting in eight injuries.

 The expected rally on Saturday-Clean Hong Kong Day－organized by Legislator Junius Ho Kwan-yiu, is in an attempt to remove memos and notes containing political opinions on over 70""Lennon Walls"" in places such as underpasses and footbridges across the city.

 The police will deploy manpower across various districts on Saturday in an attempt to prevent conflicts from escalating out of control, said Fang Chi-kin, superintendent of the Hong Kong Police operations wing, on Friday.

 The Lennon Walls, more often than not, have been sites of violence over the past three months, Fang said. Since June, police launched 40 criminal investigations into physical confrontations taking place near the walls, and arrested 57 people on charges including assault and possession of offensive weapons.

 While police have always respected the citizens' freedom of speech rights, they have to be carried out in a peaceful and orderly manner and no one should resort to violence, he added.

 Later on Friday, a top Hong Kong police officer said that law enforcement officers were getting more and more united and determined as the protests and escalated violence mounted.

 The top officer made the remarks during a closed-door media session at police headquarters in Wan Chai district on condition of anonymity. The city has endured 15 consecutive weeks of street protests which went from peaceful rallies to illegal protests with masked radicals resorting to escalating violence and extreme acts of vandalism.

 The police unity and determination could be witnessed through resignation rates. He said the nonscheduled resignation rate for police so far this year is around 1.1 percent. The rate in 2018 was around 1.6 percent.

 ""We, the police force, won't be intimidated by any acts of violence,"" he said.

 When asked about accusations of police officers allegedly using excessive force, the top official said it is fair to say Hong Kong's police force is one of the most restrained in the world, but some media just show a partial picture.

 He said he went to New York in June and met with police officers. When he played video clips showing radicals' vandalism and then showed them what the media was saying, they were shocked at the huge differences between what's been written and what's been documented on camera.

 He called for media to give accurate, fair and balanced media coverage on police actions.

 It has been more than 100 days since the violent protests started in June. So far, 1,474 people have been arrested at illegal protests and 207 have since been charged.

 He said he agreed in theory that if there were fast-track of court procedures, it would change the current situation as people, especially the young, would know that there is a price to pay for illegal acts."
Integrating into the Greater Bay Area: an entrepreneurial story of a HKer as a 'Super Connector',"""My role is actually to be a 'Super Connector' between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland,"" Winson Kwok, a 31-year-old Hong Kong entrepreneur, explained during an interview with People's Daily Online in Shenzhen on Wednesday, sharing his entrepreneurial story in the Chinese mainland. Kwok advocated more Hong Kong youths to explore their dreams beyond Hong Kong.

 As a Hong Kong local, Winson Kwok is no stranger to the Chinese mainland. At the age of 27, he co-founded Corporate Hub in Hong Kong, a consultancy firm focusing on company formation, company secretary, accounting, tax and advisory services. However, his footsteps are not limited to his hometown. Three years ago, he joined Shenzhen GJS Technology Co., LTD., a high-tech enterprise specializing in R&D, producing and promoting consumer battle robots and gaming robots, as Hong Kong Affairs Officer, offering information and support for the Shenzhen-based company to adapt to the global market.

 In his words, his role is actually to be a ""Super Connector,"" bridging the Chinese mainland and the rest of the world, which is also the position that Hong Kong aims to be on a global level.

 Dreams grow with ""Shenzhen speed"" 

 For Winson, Shenzhen is a promising city that can help him realize his dreams and explore more opportunities beyond Hong Kong. As part of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, Shenzhen's unique position and preferential policies have made it more attractive for Winson, as well as other Hong Kong youths.

 ""When I arrived, Shenzhen arranged a house for me under the 'talent house support' policy. Besides, the tax I pay here is lower than that of Shenzhen residents. In fact, the Central Government strongly supports Hong Kong people doing business in the Chinese mainland,"" Winson told People's Daily Online.

 Having worked in Shenzhen for three years, Winson has witnessed the rapid progress of the city. His working place, Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Youth Innovation and Entrepreneur Hub, or E-Hub, is an example. ""I can see the continuous upgrading of facilities here. The toilets are renovated every half year. This is the epitome of the speed of Shenzhen,"" Winson said. ""Shenzhen boasts many excellent facilities to help make your dreams come true.""

 E-Hub has become home to 388 entrepreneurial teams since its official opening in December 2014, nearly half of whom are from Hong Kong, becoming a launchpad for young entrepreneurs who wish to explore more opportunities. 

 ""Don't just stay in Hong Kong""

 As violent protests continue to rock Hong Kong, Winson also expressed his concern over the current riots in the region and voiced his hope for a stable and prosperous Hong Kong.

 ""I hope that even if you are dissatisfied with current society, you choose to express yourselves peacefully,"" said Winson. ""Let's give full play to the functions of each city, and make joint efforts to boost the development of the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong.""

 According to Winson, there is still a section of young Hongkongers who have never been to the Chinese mainland, which results in their ignorance, or misunderstanding, towards the mainland. 

 In 2018, Winson attended a short-term program in the China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing. (Photo/Provided by Winson Kwok)

 Last year, Winson attended a short-term program in the China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing, which impressed him with high-quality educational resources. In his eyes, Hong Kong youths need to go out and see what the mainland is like, and studying in the mainland can be an excellent opportunity to do so.

 ""I would encourage college students in Hong Kong to study in the Chinese mainland in their first or second year of university, with the credits counting towards their degree. This can be a good use of their time, and also gives them a chance to build up a friendship with students in the Chinese mainland,"" said Winson, adding that this kind of communication is an effective way to enhance the mutual understanding between young people from the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong.

 ""Don't just stay in Hong Kong,"" Winson advised. ""Go out and look at the problems facing young people in other cities and countries. Then, you may see that young Hongkongers face fewer challenges. At the same time, look at the level of government support for young people elsewhere, then you may see that, whether it be the Chinese mainland or Hong Kong, both are doing well compared to other places.""

 ""Hong Kong, is really a great place,"" he added."
Why Houston Rockets’ Morey has taken the wrong side on the issue of Hong Kong,"Daryl Morey, general manager of the American basketball team the Houston Rockets, has been bombarded with criticism from Chinese fans after he sent a tweet in support of the mobs and chaos in Hong Kong. Morey, who posted an image reading “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong” on Saturday, replacing the controversial tweet with an image of Tokyo, while Tilman Fertitta, owner of Houston Rockets, swiftly distanced his team from Morey’s inappropriate remarks. Be that as it may, Morey should have known his position and influence as the team’s general manager better.

 Chinese basketball fans have taken to social media to express their discontent over Morey’s tweet, calling for the general manager’s resignation. In recent years, the Rockets have been gaining popularity and profit in China, with Morey being one of the biggest beneficiaries. Running with the hare and hunting with the hounds, Morey’s remarks have surely infuriated the Chinese fans.

 There are plenty of people who share Morey’s double-faced attitudes towards China in the United States. Not long ago, when I went to an NBA show, I was warmly welcomed by the manager. Though he was full of praise for the enormous potential of the Chinese market, he had little interest in the needs of Chinese. I would not be surprised if he made similar remarks regarding Hong Kong as Morey did.

 There are three reasons why Morey and his type hold biased opinions on Hong Kong’s current situation.

 There are some misleading accusations circulating in some Western media that have played a vital role. Ever since the beginning of the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Protests, the constant barrage of western reports has glorified the mobs attacking police as heroes, stigmatizing the law keepers as villains. Many pictures used by US media outlets have contradicted the facts. For instance, the brutal and violent attacks on police officers have been largely neglected, while their legal self-defense has been grossly exaggerated. It is hard to find images of mobs chasing and harming the police, though a mob’s “kneeling-down-before-the-police” performance has been rendered excessively by western media outlets. Such selective reports would surely misguide the public.

 Bias and prejudice against China have provided a hotbed for such selective reports. For many Americans, the western methods are the best solution for state governance, while the Chinese system, totally different from its western counterparts, is deemed as a rebel against orthodoxy. Such biased reports can satisfy many readers, while those who impartially speak for China will be tagged as “pro-communism” types. In recent years, many American politicians, by fair means or foul, have made great effort to tarnish China’s image, forging the American society’s prejudice against China.

 Western hypocrisy is also a contributing factor. Leaders in the sports, business as well as financial industries and more that side with Morey are all profit-driven. Though always talking about democracy and freedom, it is the financial benefits that they are really craving for. They would do anything to become rich, let it be lies, blackmails, or bullying. There are those American entrepreneurs who have earned a great fortune in China yet still stand with the US politicians in the trade war against China, they are good examples.

 Hong Kong is an inseparable part of China. The Chinese blockbuster, My people, My country, has moved countless Chinese audiences to tears because of the scene in the movie depicting the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997. Chinese people have gone through hard times, and we firmly believe that the time when China was humiliated by Western powers is long gone. Any attempt to challenge our strategy of One Country, Two Systems, or China’s national sovereignty, shall not be tolerated. Those like Morey should clearly understand that there is no way to enjoy the benefit from the Chinese market while challenging the country’s bottom line at the same time!"
HKSAR blasts Taipei for wrangling over suspect,"Murder suspect Chan Tong-kai is seen inside a vehicle leaving Pik Uk Prison in Hong Kong on Wednesday. Chan, whose case helped ignite months of protests in the city, has been released from prison. [Photo/Agencies]

 The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government slammed Taiwan authorities for ""irresponsible"" handling of the voluntary surrender of Chan Tong-kai, 20, a Hong Kong resident and a suspect in a murder in Taiwan, whose case helped fuel months of social unrest in Hong Kong.

 Taipei's request for cross-jurisdiction law enforcement in Chan's case shows ""utter disrespect"" for Hong Kong's jurisdiction and is totally unacceptable, Secretary for Security John Lee Ka-chiu said at the Legislative Council on Wednesday.

 Taiwan authorities should bear all responsibility if justice cannot be served because they set up hurdles and restrictions to obstruct Chan's surrender, Lee added, accusing Taiwan authorities of shifting the blame to Hong Kong and acting on political motives.

 Also Wednesday, Lee announced the official withdrawal of the proposed extradition bill, which has sparked months of anti-government protests. Chan's case had been cited by the SAR government as the primary reason for the amendment, a move to plug loopholes in the city's extradition laws.

 Chan is a suspect in the killing of his pregnant girlfriend, Poon Hiu-wing, in Taiwan in February last year. He was arrested by Hong Kong police after fleeing to the city, and was convicted of money laundering for stealing from his late girlfriend's bank accounts. During the investigation, police said, he confessed that he killed Poon.

 Taiwan authorities issued a warrant for Chan and asked the Hong Kong government to surrender the fugitive.

 On Friday, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor received a letter from Chan expressing his willingness to turn himself in to Taiwan authorities to face murder charges.

 Taiwan previously had rejected accepting Chan's surrender, instead insisting first on the signing of a mutual legal assistance framework with the SAR, while asking Hong Kong to provide any evidence it had in the case.

 In a surprising U-turn on Tuesday, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council proposed having their law enforcement officers escort Chan back to Taiwan.

 On Wednesday, Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen blamed Hong Kong for being ""reluctant to exercise their jurisdictional power to bring justice to the victim's family"". She said that Chan could not just get on a plane and turn himself in once in Taiwan, but would have to be arrested in Hong Kong.

 HKSAR Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah said she firmly rejected Tsai's allegations, adding that Hong Kong's Department of Justice does not have the legal basis to charge Chan with murder or to detain him.

 ""Taiwan has jurisdiction over this case, as the murder case occurred in Taiwan, with almost all evidence in Taiwan,"" she said, referring to Hong Kong's territorial principle. The principle is part of international law under which governments can prosecute crime within their borders but are prevented from exercising jurisdiction beyond their borders.

 The SAR said that Taiwan officers have no power to enforce laws in Hong Kong.

 On Tuesday, Tam Yiu-chung, Hong Kong's sole representative to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said Taiwan's request put politics over justice. He called it a tactic to be wielded during the 2020 election in Taiwan.

 On Wednesday morning, Chan, walked out of the prison after serving 18 months in prison for money laundering and apologized to the victim's family. He also pleaded with Hong Kong residents for forgiveness, since his case was a spark for months of anti-government protests."
AmCham calls for smooth commerce in Hong Kong,"The American Chamber of Commerce in China says that a ""smoothly functioning"" system of commerce in Hong Kong is ""fundamentally important"" to the business interests of its members in the Chinese mainland.

 The comments made by the influential American business group in China come as business in the city has faced disruptions over the past nine weeks as protests and civil unrest over a now-suspended extradition bill have blocked streets, shut down parts of the city's transit system and forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights at Hong Kong's airport.

 The protests have expanded to larger grievances about the city's leadership and how the police have responded to the demonstrations, according to the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.

 ""It is without question that smoothly functioning Hong Kong commerce is fundamentally important to our members' business interests and an important validator of the 'one country, two systems' approach,"" Timothy Stratford, chairman of AmCham China, said. ""Faithful implementation of this approach helps Hong Kong maintain its reputation as an attractive destination for foreign investment.""

 The English-language newspaper wants to find out what Hong Kong protesters really want, two months on.

 One country, two systems is a concept where Hong Kong and Macao are part of China, but retain their economic and political systems.

 Clashes between the police and groups of protesters have become increasingly violent, with police firing 800 rounds of tear gas on Monday alone. Violent confrontations also have taken place between demonstrators and gangs of men, some with suspected triad links, in recent weeks.

 Hundreds of people joined in a mass sit-in at the airport on Friday as part of three days of demonstrations that are planned in the city.

 The overall economic effect has been difficult to judge, but the retail, hospitality, airline and property sectors have all been affected. Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States also have all raised issued travel warnings about the city in recent days, citing the civil unrest.

 Cathay Pacific Airways said on Wednesday that it had seen a double-digit drop in advance ticket sales for travel to Hong Kong in the coming months because of the social unrest. Intercontinental Hotels Group, the owner of Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza hotels, also said its revenue per available room in Hong Kong was down in the second quarter because of the political dispute.

 Hundreds of protesters occupy Hong Kong airport amid increased security

 On Friday night, the Hong Kong Association of Banks said the increasingly violent confrontations would affect ""Hong Kong's hard-earned position as an international financial centre.""

 ""The HKAB calls on members of the public to stop all violent acts and to resolve differences through dialogues,"" the group said. ""We also hope that the Hong Kong community will return to calm and peace soon.""

 Some of the city's largest banks, Standard Chartered and HSBC, have said that the effect on their businesses was ""limited"", so far, beyond temporary closure of some branches.

 AmCham Hong Kong, a sister organisation, said that 37.1 per cent of its members surveyed in a straw poll in late July were ""pessimistic"" in the short-term over the city's prospects and 34.4 per cent believe that the city's ""long-term prospects have been irreparably damaged"".

 The South China Morning Post also reports that the AmCham urges 'clear leadership' after fresh Hong Kong clashes. The business group said the survey found that members had taken revenue hits from disruptions to supply chains and consumption and expressed longer term doubts over cancelled events and delayed investments. About 12 per cent of AmCham Hong Kong's 1,400 members responded to the survey between July 23 and July 25.

 ""AmCham urges the government to stem any further damage and show clear leadership in meeting the expectations of Hong Kong people and in restoring the city's international reputation for effective governance under the 'one country, two systems' framework,"" Tara Joseph, president of AmCham Hong Kong, was quoted as saying in a statement."
China condemns U.S. House approval of bill on Hong Kong: spokesperson,"BEIJING, Oct. 16 (Xinhua) -- A spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council on Wednesday made serious protest to and strongly condemned the passing of the so-called Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 by the U.S. House of Representatives.

 The U.S. House of Representatives passed the act, proposed by some congressmen, on Tuesday local time despite strong opposition from the Chinese government."
Western interference in China’s internal affairs won’t work,"Foreign experts are calling for an end to the violence committed by radical demonstrators in Hong Kong and denouncing external forces behind the protests.

 Hong Kong was engulfed in violence as radical demonstrators blatantly violated the law in order to achieve their goals. Due to illegal and violent demonstrations at the Hong Kong airport, hundreds of flights were cancelled, and a large number of passengers were stranded, which not only caused huge losses, but also seriously violated the right of other people to travel.

 Jamshed Ulmasov, president of Tajikistan’s Avesta News Agency, said the international community shows great concern about the illegal and violent protests in Hong Kong.

 ""The rule of law is above everything else. Anyone who exercises personal rights must abide by the law and not harm the interests of others,"" said Ulmasov.

 The illegal and violent acts conducted by those who attempt to hurt other people’s interests and disrupt social order in the name of exercising individual rights are absolutely not allowed and can’t be accepted, he said.

 Ulmasov believes that the actions taken by Hong Kong police are completely legal. It is a universal practice that police officers take enforcement actions against violations of laws. This should not be criticized or slandered.

 Ulmasov took the illegal demonstrations in Italy, Germany and other Western countries as an example, saying relevant government departments took all necessary measures permitted by laws, including by force, to control the situation.

 ""If the government does not stop violence in time, the chaotic situation is very likely to deteriorate,” Ulmasov pointed out.

 Calling for vigilance against distorted reports from certain Western media, he stressed that it has been unfortunate they failed to report China from all angles, but focused only on the protesters and deliberately ignored the voice of the government. For certain purposes, few Western journalists are willing to fully and objectively understand what is happening in Hong Kong.

 ""The current situation in Hong Kong, China is heartbreaking,"" said Rashid Alimov, former Secretary General of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, when meeting with the Chinese Ambassador to Tajikistan Liu Bin.

 Hong Kong is a beautiful, stable and prosperous international metropolis, and the people there are kindhearted and hospitable. After returning to the motherland, it has become even more vital, and is embracing unprecedented development opportunities. The people of Hong Kong also enjoy the rights that were previously unimaginable in the colonial period.

 The recent illegal and violent demonstrations in Hong Kong have astonished the international community. This situation should not happen in Hong Kong, a society with the rule of law, Alimov noted.

 It can be seen that some countries do not want Hong Kong to become more and more prosperous and more stable under the guidance of the ""one country, two systems"" principle. So they implement the 'long-arm jurisdiction' and unscrupulously intervene in Hong Kong affairs.

 Certain countries are blatantly supporting violent acts and interfering in other countries’ internal affairs under the banner of “democracy” and “freedom”, which runs counter to international law and the norms of international relations.

 The international community believes that the Chinese government has the determination and ability to continue to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, Alimov said."
