EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: Why China Needs Hong Kong,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Political unrest has cast doubt on Hong Kong's prospects, yet for Chinese companies the city plays a role that neither Shanghai nor global financial centers such as New York can easily displace.
There are legitimate fears: The protests that have roiled Hong Kong for three months could make China more supportive of its homegrown exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen. China has been gradually opening up its stock markets in the past few years. Just this week it scrapped the quotas on two investment programs for foreign institutional investors. Shenzhen and Shanghai now boast a combined market capitalization of $7.5 trillion, nearly twice Hong Kong's.
Chinese companies make up about 70% of the Hong Kong market, so losing their business to the mainland would be an existential threat. The almost $37 billion unsolicited bid made Wednesday by the city's stock-exchange operator, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, for its peer in London may have betrayed some unease.
Still, Hong Kong's separate monetary and legal systems -- as long as they are maintained -- should secure its unique role as China's financial firewall. The city's unfettered capital flows and rule of law have allowed Chinese companies to tap foreign investors and pursue acquisitions abroad, while leaving China's own financial system relatively insulated.
And while China's markets have been opening up, the pace of inflows has remained slow. Foreign investors only own about 3% of the stocks, which tend to be highly volatile, and more than half of that came through a trading link with Hong Kong itself. The so-called ""Stock Connect"" has brought a cumulative 794 billion yuan ($112 billion) into mainland markets since its 2014 launch.
China has tried many times to create its own version of Nasdaq that might attract domestic, or even foreign, tech companies without success. Its latest attempt, Shanghai's STAR market, has just blown more bubbles.
New York in particular does compete with Hong Kong for initial public offerings. For Chinese companies wanting to tap foreign capital, though, Hong Kong remains the undisputed first choice. Over the past five years, nearly three-quarters of Chinese IPOs that haven't taken place on the Chinese mainland have been in Hong Kong, according to Dealogic.
Last year, mainland companies raised $35 billion through Hong Kong IPOs -- more than the $21 billion they raised in mainland China. Property developers and financial institutions are particularly big users of Hong Kong's capital markets: Between 2012 and 2018, about half of their equity financings, including secondary offerings and rights issues as well as IPOs, took place in Hong Kong, according to brokerage Natixis.
While other global financial centers could probably serve Chinese companies' offshore needs -- Singapore has the most similar business model -- Hong Kong already has a cluster of Chinese investors and financial institutions that understand the country far better. Rising tensions between China and the U.S. may also give Chinese companies second thoughts about tapping American capital markets.
As long as Hong Kong stays open while mainland China remains relatively closed, the city will be China's only truly global financial center.

Beijing Moves on Hong Kong,"China appears to be making its long-expected move to crush dissent in Hong Kong, with arrests of pro-democracy lawmakers and activists and a ban on a march planned for this weekend. The crackdown is a gamble that the public will be cowed, but it could ignite even more resentment and protests.
On Friday Hong Kong police under orders from chief executive Carrie Lam arrested Jeremy Tam, Au Nok-hin and Cheng Chung-tai. All three were elected to the city's Legislative Council and are vocal critics of Beijing's refusal to allow the genuine autonomy China promised in a treaty with Britain. The lawmakers face a range of protest-related charges.
Police also detained Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow, 22-year-old activists who are part of the pro-democracy group Demosisto. Both were released on bail, but Mr. Wong faces three charges and Ms. Chow faces two related to their role in an unauthorized June assembly. Each charge carries a penalty of up to five years in prison. Andy Chan, founder of the pro-independence Hong Kong National Party, was arrested Thursday and charged with rioting, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years. These six join 1,000 or so others who have been detained for protesting since June.
The timing is no coincidence. On Thursday police denied a permit for a protest planned for Saturday by the Civil Human Rights Front, a pro-democracy group that has held three peaceful protests since June 9 that have drawn a million or more participants. The head of Civil Human Rights Front, Jimmy Sham, was attacked Thursday by two armed thugs with baseball bats, and a friend was hurt defending him. Unleashing gangsters to assault opponents is a favorite Beijing tactic.
Hong Kongers are denied the right to elect their chief executive and the majority of their lawmakers, and now authorities want to deny their recourse to peacefully express their discontent. The Civil Human Rights Front says that without a permit it is ""unable to call and will not be calling for a demonstration"" for Saturday. Outraged by the arrests, many still plan to march.
No permit is required in Hong Kong for a religious assembly, so some will sing hymns and pray. Others say they'll flock to Hong Kong Island to ""enjoy the scenery"" or ""go shopping."" They're hoping to avoid legal repercussions, but in a news conference Friday Kwok Pak-chung, the regional police commander for Hong Kong Island, warned a ""religious demonstration"" won't be exempt from the ban.
Hong Kong's authorities take their orders from Beijing, which may be looking for an excuse to crack down before Oct. 1, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. On Tuesday Ms. Lam dodged whether she'd invoke a state of emergency, saying the government would consider using ""all laws in Hong Kong -- if they can provide a legal means to stop the violence and chaos.""
Under Hong Kong law, in ""an occasion of emergency or public danger"" the chief executive has authority to ""make any regulations whatsoever which he may consider desirable in the public interest."" These powers may include ""censorship, and the control and suppression of publications,"" arrests, the seizure of property, and the restriction of transportation.
Meanwhile, China on Friday ordered Wall Street Journal reporter Chun Han Wong to leave the country for reporting on the Australian business activities of a cousin of Chinese President Xi Jinping. The foreign ministry also cited a recent editorial on Hong Kong, though Chinese officials know Mr. Wong had nothing to do with the editorial. The Journal's news and opinion sections are independent and have separate reporting lines to the publisher.
Beijing can't tolerate our editorials or protests in Hong Kong because they expose the Communist Party's lack of democratic legitimacy. Ms. Lam and the police claim they want to preserve order and rule of law in Hong Kong, but they're the ones eroding both. If there's more unrest this weekend and beyond, the fault lies with Beijing and its refusal to honor its promise to Hong Kong and Britain of ""one country, two systems"" through 2047. The world needs to speak up for Hong Kong and its brave freedom fighters."
Hong Kong's Housing Set for a Fall,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
In his pursuit of the Road Runner, Wile E. Coyote occasionally finds himself running on air, having unknowingly sprinted off the edge of a sheer cliff.
Hong Kong's property market is in a similar situation after five months of mass protests. And should the housing market stumble, the de facto central bank's ability to support it might be exceedingly limited.
At first glance, you would barely notice there is a problem: Housing prices were down just 2.3% year over year in September, a smaller decline than was recorded during the 2015-16 slowdown in the Chinese economy. Transactions actually rose in October as the government relaxed mortgage caps for first-time buyers. Sector stocks still sport small gains for the year.
Yet Hong Kong is in a recession for the first time in a decade. Business activity declined at the fastest pace in at least two decades in October, according to the city's purchasing managers index.
Though headline data have yet to show much impact on the housing market, the damage is becoming apparent in the commercial property sector.
In October, local property agency Midland IC&I recorded 242 registrations of commercial and industrial premises, the second-lowest figure since 1996. Real-estate agency Savills suggested that rents for stores in prime locations and shopping centers have fallen by more than 15% in the year to September.
Far fewer commercial real-estate buildings are owner-occupied relative to the residential market, which makes the sector more sensitive to immediate economic conditions that translate quickly into falling rents.
But the residential market can't help but follow. Apartment rents and property demand may trail the collapse in business activity, but they can't remain separate forever.
What's more, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has limited flexibility to respond, as monetary policy is dictated by its peg to the U.S. dollar.
House prices already were extremely expensive, running at about 20 times average income in late 2018. That makes the city more than twice as expensive as markets such as London and San Francisco.
Unless the protest movement ends peacefully and quickly -- something that looks exceedingly unlikely -- gravity is bound to catch up with the city's property market.

World News: China's Troops Keep Low Profile in City,"The possibility that Beijing would call in its army to quell unrest in Hong Kong is widely seen as remote. But saber-rattling from the Chinese government has raised the specter of such an intervention.
China has 6,000 to 10,000 People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Hong Kong, analysts and diplomats estimate. They can be mobilized quickly but are largely unseen, except for dedicated open days or rare events, such as helping to clean up after a powerful typhoon felled trees last year.
Responding Tuesday to nearly two months of protests in the semiautonomous city, the spokesman for Beijing's top office for Hong Kong affairs, Yang Guang, praised the PLA's strength, while stressing that authorities think Hong Kong police can restore order.
""The PLA is a strong force that defends every inch of its sacred territory. It is strong and reliable,"" Mr. Yang said. ""But it is also a civilized power. It is under the command of the Communist Party of China, and it acts in accordance to law.""
The Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution, says military forces stationed by Beijing in the region for defense shouldn't interfere with local affairs. However, local authorities can ask Beijing for assistance from the garrison for public order and disaster relief.
The army's headquarters in Hong Kong sits near the city's government headquarters, and those stationed inside have had a front-row view of the demonstrations.
Most people in the city associate the PLA with its violent crackdown on protests at Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989, which is why the idea of the garrison's being summoned causes so much anxiety, said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.
""It is also associated with the idea of Beijing taking direct control of Hong Kong and the effective end of the 'one country, two systems' framework,"" Mr. Tsang said.

Escalation From Beijing on Its National Day,"Hong Kong -- President Xi Jinping wanted Tuesday -- Beijing's National Day -- to be a celebration of the 70th anniversary of communist China. Instead, it marked an escalation in violence against Hong Kong. For the first time, police fired a live round at a protester, an 18-year-old student, who suffered a chest wound.
National Day had loomed for months as a potential milestone for the protest movement that has roiled Hong Kong since June. Authorities wanted to quell the unrest before Oct. 1, while protesters strove to keep it alive until then -- and they prevailed. Tuesday's shooting will invigorate the protests, and Beijing has no obvious solution to this political crisis.
In a video address Tuesday night, a police spokeswoman claimed that protesters had attacked officers, one of whom fired ""to save his own life and his colleagues' lives."" She added: ""The police do not wish to see anyone injured in the incident. It is really heart-breaking.""
Hong Kongers don't buy it. They believe only international pressure has prevented a massacre. They were especially heartened when President Trump told reporters in August that ""it would be very hard to deal"" with Beijing ""if it's another Tiananmen Square"" in Hong Kong. Wong Chun Wing, 20, told me he first regarded Mr. Trump as crazy but has come to respect him because he stands up for human rights and challenges China. Mr. Wong doesn't believe Hillary Clinton would have taken such a hard line. Protesters now carry American flags as ""a way to say thank you,"" he said.
Emboldened by international support, Hong Kongers say they will quit the streets only if the government meets their ""five demands, not one less,"" as the rallying cry goes. Beijing is afraid of conceding too much, lest mainland Chinese learn that demonstrations and disorder yield results.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam acquiesced to one demand last month, agreeing to withdraw the extradition bill that triggered the large-scale protests in June. ""That invited a lot of criticism in China,"" said Fu King Wa, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong who has been tracking online discussion in the mainland. ""They take withdrawal of the bill as a major concession"" and question why the government would ""back down"" in response ""to a rioter who created violence.""
It would be even harder for Beijing to accede to the protesters' remaining four demands -- for free elections, an independent inquiry into police violence, official acknowledgment that the protests aren't riots, and amnesty for those who've been arrested. Instead authorities are working to discredit the protesters. While the vast majority have been peaceful, a minority have brawled with cops, thrown Molotov cocktails or bricks, started fires, and damaged property. Ms. Lam argues that giving them amnesty would ""run counter to rule of law.""
Following the lead of their mainland counterparts, Hong Kong authorities are also attempting to buy legitimacy with material blandishments. In August Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced a US$2.4 billion spending package, which includes numerous handouts. In a New York Times op-ed last week, Ms. Lam promised ""bold initiatives to tackle deep-seated problems, such as access to affordable housing,"" along with ""numerous major projects and initiatives . . . that will provide thousands of jobs and opportunities for young people to explore for years to come.""
In another effort at appeasement, Ms. Lam launched a series of ""community dialogue sessions,"" where the public can vent concerns. Some in Hong Kong have speculated that without directly addressing protesters' demands, she may also establish commissions to explore how Hong Kong can reform its police department or gradually work toward a more representative government. But no one braves water cannons, rubber bullets and tear gas for listening sessions or the dithering of bureaucrats. And dialogue, like a commission or special report, sets the expectation that the government will eventually address Hong Kongers' concerns. A disappointing outcome would only exacerbate the public discontent.
Beijing and its pawns in the Hong Kong government have tried to intimidate protesters with nonlethal force and wait until their energy runs out. That strategy has failed, and Tuesday's violence will add to the protesters' momentum. Against all odds, Hong Kongers succeeded in defeating the extradition bill that presented an immediate threat to their autonomy, calling global attention to Beijing's abuses of power, and leaving Beijing with no good way to end an embarrassing spectacle.
The greatest threat to their success may be the prospect of a U.S.-China trade deal. If Mr. Trump succeeds in striking one, he may be less eager to take Beijing to task over Hong Kong. The risk for protesters is that the world will lose interest in the confrontation, emboldening Beijing.

"World News: China Frees Consulate Employee, Police Say","HONG KONG -- China said it released an employee of the British consulate in Hong Kong after detaining him for 15 days.
Simon Cheng, a Hong Kong citizen who works as a trade and investment officer at the U.K. mission here, called his girlfriend and told her he had returned home Saturday morning, his girlfriend said. ""He called us, but none of us have seen him yet,"" she said.
The Shenzhen police said on its official Weibo account on Saturday that Mr. Cheng had been released, and that he had admitted to committing a prostitution-related offense. Mr. Cheng couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
The release would de-escalate diplomatic tensions that arose after police in Shenzhen detained him during a business trip.
Mr. Cheng was held at a time of unrest in Hong Kong. The city has been rocked by 11 weeks of protests against Beijing.
The police alleged Thursday that Mr. Cheng had committed a prostitution-related offense, without offering any evidence. The allegation was met with skepticism in Hong Kong.

"World News: Protest Images Fan Chinese Public Anger --- Beijing tries to steer Hong Kong narrative, signals support for stronger crackdown","BEIJING -- China's state media aired images from the aftermath of Hong Kong's latest antigovernment protests, a change in tack that appears aimed at stirring public anger against the demonstrations, as Beijing signaled support for a stronger crackdown by authorities in the city.
After Hong Kong protesters on Sunday defaced a Chinese central government office in the city, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said local authorities should use ""all necessary measures to . . . safeguard the rule of law in Hong Kong and punish criminals"" -- without saying specifically what that response might entail.
For now, Beijing likely wants Hong Kong to arrest protesters and stop further demonstrations. Should that fail, experts said, Beijing has options -- many of them unpalatable and risky -- including calling in the military.
In high-profile commentaries on Monday, major Chinese news outlets reported that ""radical protesters"" in Hong Kong a day earlier defaced the Liaison Office by splashing black paint on the state emblem on the front of the building and writing derogatory slogans on its walls. Footage showing the vandalized emblem and building appeared on China Central Television's Monday evening newscast, which the state broadcaster later described as its first time airing ""images of the violence causing disorder in Hong Kong.""
Pro-Beijing opinions were allowed to proliferate on Chinese social media, as censors appeared to tolerate the sharing of footage and images of the unrest in Hong Kong -- as long as they kept to the official narrative on the protests.
On the popular Weibo microblogging service, for instance, some users expressed support for what appeared to be a pro-government counterprotest in Hong Kong's northwestern district of Yuen Long, where a large group of men in white shirts stormed a subway station late Sunday and beat people whom they blamed for taking part in antigovernment demonstrations, leaving 45 people injured.
The white-clad activists are suspected to be linked to local organized-crime gangs known as triads that operate in the villages on Hong Kong's more remote fringes, a Hong Kong Democratic Party official told The Wall Street Journal. Police on Monday said they arrested two people in connection with the attack.
Adam Ni, a China researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney, said Beijing appeared to be trying to take control of the narrative, as word of the protests had reached people on the mainland over the past seven weeks despite censorship efforts.
""The Chinese government is essentially preparing the people for a potential acceleration of the crisis in Hong Kong,"" Mr. Ni said. ""It has really seen the writing on the wall that the majority of the Hong Kong people are not happy with the current arrangement.""
In recent weeks, demonstrators in Hong Kong have broadened their list of targets which have included symbols of China's presence in the city, including a high-speed rail station that connects to the mainland.
At a press conference Monday, the Hong Kong government and its police force put up a united front to condemn the weekend's violence, which it blamed on radical groups. ""Their targeting of the national emblem can absolutely not be tolerated,"" said Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive. ""The government will take all actions to deal with perpetrators.""
""By yesterday, some demonstrators attacked the Liaison Office, defaced the national emblem and graffitied the Liaison Office,"" said Li Xiaobing, a mainland scholar who studies Hong Kong affairs. ""When things reach this stage, the nature has changed.""

World News: Cathay Pacific Warns Staff on Protests,"Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. threatened to fire staff involved in unauthorized protests against the city's government, as the airline raced to placate Beijing and avert a boycott from its mainland Chinese customers.
The move underlined the delicate position in which Hong Kong's deepening political crisis has placed the city's flag carrier, which must also avoid alienating its local customer base and much of its own workforce, some of whom say they fear a purge of staff implicated for their involvement in the protests.
The threat came as Hong Kong's airport authority canceled more than 100 flights Monday afternoon after thousands of demonstrators thronged the main terminal to protest police for their handling of this summer's long-running protests.
Shares of Cathay Pacific fell 4.9% Monday, the worst drop in three years. The Hong Kong-listed stock has now lost a fifth of its value since mid-July and closed at its lowest level in more than a decade.
In an email sent to staff Monday after another weekend of violent protests across the city -- most of which weren't authorized by the police -- Rupert Hogg, Cathay Pacific's chief executive, said the carrier had ""a zero tolerance approach to illegal activities."" He added that ""there will be disciplinary consequences for employees who support or participate in illegal protests. These consequences may include termination of employment.""
While praising the conduct of most of the carrier's staff, Mr. Hogg warned employees to steer clear of the dayslong, unauthorized protest at the airport.
The tough stance is in contrast to the approach the airline had taken just a week earlier, when Chairman John Slosar said Cathay Pacific respected the right of its employees to take part in the protests. ""We certainly wouldn't dream of telling them what they have to think about something,"" Mr. Slosar said at the time.
Those comments appeared to rile China's aviation authority, which Friday ordered Cathay Pacific to remove all employees involved in the Hong Kong protests from flights to the mainland. Meanwhile, thousands of Chinese people took to social media to criticize the airline over its stance, saying they would no longer fly Cathay.
The airline responded Saturday by announcing that it had fired two members of its ground staff. In another email to sent to staff Saturday, Mr. Hogg said the airline ""must and will comply"" with new orders from the Chinese authorities relating to the protests. These included a requirement that employees involved in protests be removed from mainland flight crews.
Chinese state-owned Air China Ltd. has a 30% stake in Cathay, which is controlled by the U.K.'s Swire Group. The carrier is a mainstay of the Hong Kong economy, with more than 26,500 staff members based in the city.

World News: Hong Kong Protesters Wary After Leader's Pullback,"HONG KONG -- For three months, protests here have been sustained by two forces: the peaceful marchers, and the more radical activists who are willing to confront authorities on the front lines. The city's leader aimed to sow divisions between the two camps in explaining her first conciliatory moves in months to try to quell social unrest.
That may not prove so easy in a city where polls show many people had turned against the government and police during the unrest, and anger is still running high.
On Thursday, explaining why she withdrew an extradition bill that kick-started a summer of dissent in the city, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said society would like ""peaceful demonstrators not to provide a legitimate basis for the really violent protesters.""
Her refusal to authorize an independent inquiry into how police have handled the protests, the opposition camp says, means neither of the opposition forces will be placated.
""If you want to talk about violence, we need to deal with police brutality first,"" said Claudia Mo, convener of the pro-democracy bloc of legislators. ""If they refuse to acknowledge or deal with police actions, there is very little we can do to proceed.""
Prominent figures from the pro-democracy movement say those legislators are the most logical bridge between the protesters and the government. Ms. Mo said the elected group of lawmakers previously asked several times for meetings with Mrs. Lam in the past few months and were told it wasn't the right time, a number of lawmakers from the camp said.
Now that Mrs. Lam has said she is seeking dialogue, Ms. Mo will consult with allies on how best to proceed. Ms. Mo said it was unconscionable that the pan-democratic bloc wasn't invited to Government House to hear about Mrs. Lam's decision on Wednesday, even though dozens of pro-Beijing legislators were in attendance.
On Thursday, Mrs. Lam was at pains to assert her authority, rather than Beijing's, in dealing with the crisis. The extradition bill -- which would have allowed people to be sent to China for trial -- was initiated, introduced and now withdrawn by her government, she said. She added that Beijing has backed her administration throughout the process.
China's central government and state media have stayed relatively muted on Mrs. Lam's decision to formally pull the bill and initiate an independent review of Hong Kong's political, economic and social climate.
Asked on Thursday whether Beijing had forced or advised Mrs. Lam to withdraw the bill, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters that the matter wasn't a diplomatic issue.
Mr. Geng also warned U.S. politicians to stop meddling in Hong Kong's affairs, after Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) said on Wednesday that the withdrawal was a ""welcome but insufficient step after the government's violent response to the Hong Kong people's desire to protect their democratic freedoms.""

Hong Kong Protesters Ramp Up Tactics --- Activists using violence present biggest challenge to China since Xi took office,"HONG KONG -- In 2014, a protester named Chloe camped out on city streets, chanted slogans and planted ""seeds of hope,"" part of a 79-day occupation of major roads. The demands for greater democracy were ignored.
This summer, the civil servant, who is in her 20s, has zip tied metal barriers together to block roads and dug bricks out of sidewalks to throw at police. Her primary role is to be ""arrest support"" -- ready to hire lawyers for detained protesters and help their families with an emergency plan.
""Some of them are prepared to die for the movement,"" said Chloe. ""I am also willing to die for it.""
Hong Kong's protests against the mainland government's increasing reach are emerging as bigger, more frequent and more violent than previous pro-democracy movements. In a contrast to 2014, when demonstrations were largely led by students, the current action has been embraced by a broader cross-section of Hong Kong society -- including civil servants, pop stars, doctors, shopkeepers and people of all ages. And those taking part in more radical acts of civil disobedience are finding wider support.
Hard-core protesters have largely rejected the strategies of veteran leaders, whose approach is seen to have failed. Actions are mostly organized by anonymous leaders of small groups.
The shift in attitude means Hong Kong's resistance has become the biggest open rebellion against China's ruling Communist Party since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012.
""There's a feeling among many that there's no other option, that some physical confrontation is the only way for the regime to listen to the voices of Hong Kongers,"" said Jeffrey Ngo, chief researcher at pro-democracy group Demosisto. Mr. Ngo said he doesn't use violence himself in the current protests, but understands why some have resorted to it.
Residents have become increasingly dissatisfied as the government has dug in its heels and police have cracked down. Police on the front lines have embraced the use of tear gas -- even in residential neighborhoods. Officers have beaten protesters with batons and stormed into shopping malls and subway stations to bring demonstrators to heel. Since June 9, 420 people have been arrested, and some have been charged with crimes that carry up to 10-year prison terms.
Beijing has endorsed the way the police have handled the protests and has sent signals it is losing patience with the unrest. Last week the Chinese army's Hong Kong garrison released a video showing soldiers performing riot drills and taking part in mock street battles.
Protests across the city continued over the past weekend. On Monday a protester-led strike disrupted the subways and airport, and kept thousands home from work.
Carrie Lam, the city's Beijing-backed chief executive, said Monday that the city was becoming dangerous and unstable, and condemned violent protests, in her first public comments in two weeks. She didn't accede to any of the protesters' demands.
Demonstrations began in early June as a fight against an extradition bill that would allow people to be sent to China for trial. The bill was set aside but not formally withdrawn, and protests morphed into a broader ideological battle to preserve Hong Kong's civil rights against the encroaching authoritarianism of China.
That has come along with irritation with changes stemming from mainland immigration and tourism, including competition for college spots and real estate, the growing necessity for Mandarin-language ability, and even the erosion of the manners Hong Kong people expect when waiting in lines. The unrest has weighed on tourism, the economy and financial markets.
Chinese officials responsible for Hong Kong have issued rebukes and urged the city's leaders to punish violent demonstrators, calling a return to law and order Hong Kong's ""most pressing priority.""
Chinese army officers have said they are ready to step in if needed, though Hong Kong's government has dismissed the possibility of calling in troops, a move that would evoke comparisons to the killing of hundreds of protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Chinese officials have at times blamed the crisis on foreign influences.
The uprising is a test of Beijing's position that Hong Kong must not be used as a base to undermine China's ruling Communist Party. Mrs. Lam, in her comments Monday, said some extremists' call for a revolution -- a common chant on the streets in recent weeks -- has changed the nature of the protest and are a challenge to China's sovereignty.
A treaty between China and the U.K. -- made when the city was returned to China in 1997 -- guarantees the independence of Hong Kong's legal system and freedom of expression until 2047. Mr. Xi, however, delivered a speech in 2017 declaring that any overt challenges to China's authority could undermine the foundation of that system.
The broad-based support for the protests is proving a tactical challenge for Beijing. A tough response would spur public outcry, and China's style of quashing opposition through censorship and imprisoning dissidents would be difficult under Hong Kong's laws.
The protests have largely been mobilized through the encrypted Telegram messaging app, Facebook and a Reddit-like website called LIHKG.
The willingness to use violence during the Hong Kong protests was a fringe idea only five years ago. Since the handover, protests have largely consisted of peaceful marches that ended at sunset, or orderly candlelight vigils. In 2014, the so-called Umbrella Movement protests became large and long-lasting, but the few tussles with police were quickly condemned by the broader movement. Tear gas was used once.
Chloe, the civil servant, said more aggressive protests are the only way to advocate for their cause.
She describes herself as someone who would rather go shopping and buy makeup than be out all night in the stifling summer heat to battle police officers. Now, like many protesters, she gets geared up before each protest: umbrellas to shield against pepper spray and gun-fired bean bag rounds; eye goggles to help reduce the effects of tear gas; a helmet; and face mask to hide her identity from police and media cameras.
""There's the feeling now that, since so many of us could be arrested later, that we need to give it our all for this cause,"" she said. ""There are no longer limits to what we can give.""
Justin, another protester on the front lines, talks less about ideology. The 19-year-old unemployed school dropout was radicalized after he choked on tear gas in the first major protester clash with the police on June 12. That day's images of riot police pointing rubber-bullet guns at protesters and chasing them shocked city residents.
The day's clash also prompted Mrs. Lam to suspend the extradition bill. ""They would ignore you unless you do something to show how firm you are,"" Justin said. ""Carrie Lam is the one that taught us this.""
He decided to crash the July 1 government ceremony celebrating the anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China. Expecting a crackdown by police, he and strangers he met in a peaceful assembly days before bought heat-resistant gloves and formed a 10-person squad to grab tear gas canisters and dunk them into the buckets of water, neutralizing their spray.
That night, protesters broke into the city's legislature, demanding election reform. Justin acted as a porter, ferrying supplies for an occupation until the plan was aborted before the police arrived.
""If we ask for the sky, we'll get a window,"" said Justin. ""If we just ask for the window, we get nothing.""
The break-in to the legislature catapulted Brian Leung to the forefront as one of the few known faces of the movement.
Most of the ardent protesters use surgical or antipollution masks to conceal their faces. Mr. Leung, 25, ripped off his mask as he stood in the middle of the legislative chamber, urging people to occupy the space.
""The escalation of punishment demands an escalation of sacrifice,"" the soft-spoken Mr. Leung said later. He is due to begin the third year of his Ph.D. studying authoritarianism and democracy at the University of Washington in the fall. ""When you look at what other people have given up for this movement, sacrifice seems less unimaginable.""
In the 2014 protests, Mr. Leung mostly stuck to the intellectual side, editing the University of Hong Kong's Undergrad magazine. This time, his action echoes a message spray-painted outside the vandalized building: ""You taught me peaceful protest doesn't work.""
Mr. Leung has since fled Hong Kong and faces possible arrest if he returns.
The shift to radicalism has its roots in a 2016 protest where protesters clashed violently with police after the clearance of unlicensed street food sellers -- the so-called Fishball Revolution.
Two leaders of a party demanding greater rights for local people, Ray Wong, an interior designer, and university student Edward Leung, were arrested and charged, in a rare move, with inciting a riot.
Mr. Wong fled to Germany, where he was last year granted asylum, and Mr. Leung was sentenced to six years in jail in Hong Kong.
Mr. Wong, 25, said the failure of peaceful protests in 2014 had led him to found the more radical group advocating for the rights of local people, who in his view were being marginalized by mainland immigrants and tourists. One of the group's causes was to target the practice of ""parallel trading"" by mainlanders who came to Hong Kong to buy less expensive or higher quality goods, such as infant formula, creating local shortages. Meanwhile, mainland buyers of real estate have driven prices higher, and mainlanders take some coveted jobs and university spots.
Some protesters consider Mr. Leung, confined to a maximum-security prison, to be a political prisoner, and a local filmmaker's documentary about his life sold out in June. ""We Miss You, Edward Leung,"" one protester graffitied under a bridge.
In a challenge for authorities, most groups of more-radical protesters are self-organized and unpredictable, and coordinators avoid the limelight. Protests can spring up within minutes via encrypted message apps or even just among clusters of people on the streets. Participants sometimes have no idea what is occurring a block over. As many as 10,000 can gather quickly and occupy streets for hours, faced off against riot police, then disappear in a flash.
""They're like sponges, absorbing information from each other,"" said Brian Leung, the man who unveiled his face in the legislative council. ""There isn't a commanding pyramid structure but there are nodes, like a social network.""
Many on the streets have become friends, forging a sense of camaraderie and unity on the front lines without any direct leadership. ""You're not a Hong Konger until you have tasted tear gas"" is a common refrain.
Amei, a fresh college graduate who loves graphic novels, first joined the protests alone. After seeing a lawmaker use a megaphone to host a discussion, she bought her own speaker and began to organize brainstorming discussions for hundreds of strangers. With her newly made friends, she is now planning to print graphical brochures about Hong Kong's protest history.
""I'm just a girl and what I can do each time is limited,"" she said. ""But there's no limit how many projects I can do.""
Some of the stalwarts of the pro-democracy movement have stepped to the background, offering support to the radical newcomers to protest the way they see fit.
Roy Kwong, a 36-year-old legislator and romantic novelist, intercedes with police at protests to minimize injuries during clashes. Joshua Wong, 22, the most internationally known face of the 2014 protests, then often making fiery speeches urging protesters to never give up, has participated in many protests since his release from jail on June 17 and has commented that there is no leader this year. On Saturday, Mr. Wong handed out McDonald's vouchers, donated by supporters who heard protesters were running out of money after spending on transport and equipment.
The Civil Human Rights Front, an old-guard umbrella organization that comprises about 50 NGOs, pan-democratic parties and other organizations focusing on human-rights issues, has organized some of the biggest rallies over the past two months, including one that they said attracted two million people on June 16.
Bonnie Leung, the group's 32-year-old vice-convener, said she now receives inquiries from citizens asking for help on how to organize their own marches. The group itself is also planning more protests.
""The people of Hong Kong have woken up in the past two months, and they know that this time it will take more to get the government to listen to us,"" said Ms. Leung, whose group doesn't advocate violence. ""The government has left us with no choice. Until they address our demands, we will not stand down.""

"Japan's Hello Kitty Shunned in South Korea's Boycott --- A trade dispute between the two nations takes a toll on toys, chocolate, cat food","SEOUL -- Not a speck of microwavable rice is off limits in South Korea's anti-Japan fervor.
A hometown brand of instant rice sold by South Korea's largest food company had its national loyalty questioned recently after social-media users identified a Japanese ingredient among the local grains. The culprit: the 0.1% inclusion of a Japanese rice-bran extract.
The company, CJ Cheiljedang Corp., swiftly apologized this month and promised to swap in a Korean alternative. It was seeking to avoid a Japanese boycott that's swept across the nation, triggered by a weekslong trade dispute between the two countries.
The campaign, fueled more by emotion than economics, initially targeted travel and marquee Japanese brands but has evolved into an effort to avoid any kind of Japanese influence.
South Koreans have amassed lists of Japanese products online, suggesting domestic alternatives to Hello Kitty dolls, cat food and chocolate. Boycotters recommended replacing Japanese anime-related merchandise with Pororo, a popular South Korean penguin character who dresses like a pilot. Boycotters can download apps that provide suggestions on the go.
South Korea's beauty queens won't travel to Tokyo for an international competition. Japanese racehorses aren't invited next month to an international event, with the Korea Racing Authority citing ""national sentiment"" as a reason.
Relations between Japan and South Korea have dipped to the worst levels in decades, in the midst of an escalating trade fight that began last month. Japan curbed some tech-related exports to South Korea in July and later dropped South Korea as a favored trading partner. Seoul took a similar move against Tokyo last week.
The dispute follows clashes between the two governments over reparations related to Japan's occupation of South Korea from 1910 to 1945, including for Japan's use of so-called comfort women and forced Korean labor.
Jeong Ji-won, 33, was headed out one day, and thought about wearing a pair of white sneakers made by Osaka-based Descente Ltd. He thought the shoes, which had gone unworn for the past month, would have paired nicely with his white long-sleeve shirt and gray shorts. He ultimately reached for his white Nikes.
""When Japan apologizes and retracts the trade restrictions, I'll wear the Descente sneakers again,"" Mr. Jeong said.
After last month's release of ""Butt Detective the Movie,"" South Korea's netizens flooded websites with bad reviews and urged others to avoid the film. The children's animated film from Japan, based on a popular comic, stars a detective whose face resembles a rear end. The film flopped.
In Seoul on Thursday -- the country's National Liberation Day, marking the end of Japanese colonial rule -- thousands joined a protest, holding signs reading ""No Abe! No Japan!"" in reference to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Some wore white T-shirts that proclaimed, ""I couldn't fight for Korea's independence but I will join the boycott!""
South Korean President Moon Jae-in, mentioning Japan's trade restrictions in a recent national address on Thursday, praised ""the Korean people's mature response to Japan's economic retaliation.""
As recently as the 1970s, South Korea had a lower per capita income than North Korea. The country has sought to engineer an economic revival by borrowing some lessons from Japan, including in manufacturing. The two also shared close ties in culture, food and travel.
Unlike in prior clashes, South Koreans now have enough purchasing power and local alternatives to deliver a significant blow to Japanese businesses, said Chun Woo-yong, a professor at the Academy of Korean Studies.
A senior Japanese official said Thursday he expected the South Korean boycott to have a small economic impact. Even after Samsung Electronics Co. leapfrogged Sony Corp., and K-pop trumped J-pop, Japan's gross domestic product is three times that of South Korea's.
The trade-offs are simple enough for Yoo Ji-woong, a 24-year-old college student. He has recently avoided 7-Eleven convenience stores -- owned by a Japanese retailer group -- opting to walk an extra five minutes to support a South Korean-owned rival.
Local Starbucks Corp. shops have stopped ordering Japanese blends such as prepackaged matcha lattes. A South Korean YouTuber issued an apology for referring to rice cakes as mochi, a Japanese term, instead of using the Korean word of ddeok.
A photo circulated on social media of a banner for a sashimi restaurant, saying it would refuse Japanese customers altogether.
Joung Ha-yoon, a 29-year-old banker, had planned to travel to Japan for summer vacation. Three weeks ago, she ditched those plans and went to Hong Kong, where she chose local beers instead of her favored Japanese Asahi. Until the trade fight ends, she has committed to suppressing her cravings for a Japanese tripe stew called motsunabe.
That wasn't too much of a sacrifice, she said. ""You can't even upload pictures of Japanese food on social media anyway.""
Sitting over a plate of salmon sushi rolls recently, Han Ji-soo, a 27-year-old food and travel blogger, has seen how the online reaction about anything Japan, including her prior trips, has become a sensitive issue.
""Now is not the time to promote anything Japan,"" said Ms. Han, pushing the salmon roll into more favorable lighting. She still planned to blog about her sushi lunch, but ""I'll have to clarify that this place is owned by Koreans.""

Politics: Washington Wire --- Dispatches from the Nation's Capital,"AN INSPECTOR GENERAL -- FOR UKRAINE? Congress considers funding for an investigative unit inside the Ukrainian military. A bipartisan delegation to Kyiv discussed the idea with Ukrainian officials earlier this month as the impeachment drama -- sparked by a whistleblower report to the IG for the U.S. intelligence community -- swirled in Washington. Members on the trip tiptoed around talking about the impeachment inquiry and instead discussed Ukraine's efforts to deal with corruption, especially in the military.
Senior members of the House Armed Services Committee on the trip agreed an IG was a good idea, though they didn't settle on a funding number. The next tranche of money for Ukraine will be in the National Defense Authorization Act that Congress is currently writing.
The Ukrainians engaged productively in discussions about the inspector general concept, which would be its military's first, Rep. John Garamendi, a Democrat who led the trip to Ukraine, told the Journal. ""They're very interested in that. They're obviously aware of IGs, whistleblowers and the like,""especially now, Garamendi said.
STREAMING PLATFORMS aim to take larger bite of political advertising dollars. Roku Inc. hires its first Washington-based direct sales resource to woo campaigns. Premion, a regional and local advertising platform, started selling political ads on streaming services in 2018 and aims for an expansion in 2020. Streaming ads allows campaigns ""increased personalization and targeting,"" Premion President Jim Wilson said.
Kantar Media predicts the 2020 campaign will cost a total of $6 billion, with the bulk still going to traditional broadcast and cable TV. The platforms' selling point is that many of their customers can't be reached via old-school TV ads anymore: ""More than half of our 30.5 million active accounts are cord cutters,"" says Alison Levin, Roku's top ad sales executive.

Republican political strategists marvel over the presidential campaign-level numbers for former astronaut Kelly, the husband of ex-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Some worry that McSally is spending too much time catering to her base of conservatives, wary of further-right primary challengers. ""She seems to get stuck defining herself with Trump,"" said Arizona GOP strategist Chuck Coughlin of McSally. A McSally campaign consultant said her fundraising numbers were ""consistently strong.""

Yang said Chinese fans would likely just watch games on pirated online video streams if games were taken off TV.

"World News: In Nearby Shenzhen, Demonstrations Don't Resonate","SHENZHEN, China -- Every day, three quarters of a million people traverse more than a dozen border crossings linking Shenzhen and Hong Kong, a symbol of the intertwined economies and fortunes of China's mainland and its prosperous territory.
But on the hot-button political issue of the day -- the antigovernment protests that have swept Hong Kong this summer -- the two cities offer a split-screen perspective.
As tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents marched through a torrential downpour on Sunday, in next-door Shenzhen there was widespread knowledge of unrest across the border but little evidence of support for the demonstrators, and limited awareness of their demands.
It can be difficult to assess public opinion in mainland China, where people are frequently loath to express opposition to the government on sensitive issues. Dozens of residents interviewed in recent days in Shenzhen, widely viewed as the mainland's most open city, generally echoed Beijing's official line.
Many said the protests risked damaging the economy and that demonstrators had gone too far in challenging Chinese authority.
""It's so chaotic in Hong Kong,"" said one resident of Shenzhen, expressing a widespread view here that Hong Kong's protesters have abused the special liberties conferred on them under the terms of the territory's return to Chinese rule. ""The government should do something.""
Wang Junqi, a 21-year-old student shopping in Shenzhen's electronics district, dismissed the possibility that Chinese people outside Hong Kong would be inspired by the activism there. ""Shenzhen and Hong Kong are close, but not that close,"" she said.
People along the border in Shenzhen can tune into Hong Kong television news, where a lively debate is playing out, but many say they prefer mainstream Chinese sources of information, like the ubiquitous smartphone app WeChat, created by Shenzhen-based giant Tencent Holdings Ltd.
In an apparent bid to keep protest-related material like photos and handbills out of the mainland, Chinese border police have been examining mobile phones and bags of travelers crossing over into Shenzhen from Hong Kong.
When 18-year-old Godfried Chan and his 14-year-old sister crossed into Shenzhen for a day of shopping on Friday, Chinese officers directed the Hong Kong teenagers into a small room to inspect the photos on their phones. Mr. Chan was eventually allowed to enter the mainland, having deleted protest pictures from his phone the previous night.
Four decades after Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping made the city a laboratory for economic reforms, Shenzhen's population now tops that of Hong Kong.
Hong Kong's waning cultural and economic influence with China has helped Beijing guide the narrative during the turmoil so ""most Chinese people understand the movement as radical and violent,"" said Xi Chen, an expert on social movements at Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""Censorship is only part of it.""

"World News: Violent Clashes Erupt at Hong Kong Mall --- With national celebrations just over a week away, protests show no sign of abating","HONG KONG -- A peaceful rally at a major suburban shopping mall turned hostile, reflecting Hong Kong's struggle to contain clashes and public anger at the police ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China.
Sunday's clashes inside the New Town Plaza mall in Sha Tin followed street battles on Saturday, when protesters threw Molotov cocktails. Hong Kong has canceled fireworks planned for the sensitive Oct. 1 anniversary in light of the unrest.
Many in the movement have condemned what they call excessive police force against demonstrators. Two months ago, in one of those incidents, police charged protesters with batons and pepper spray at the mall.
The mood at New Town Plaza in the city's largest residential district quickly turned hostile late Sunday afternoon, as the sight of riot police entering the venue set off panic among activists, who minutes earlier were singing songs, chanting their demands and folding paper cranes.
A group of masked demonstrators began creating a barricade with trash cans, fencing, even sofas, then slicked the floors with cooking oil, soap and water. The smell of spray paint -- which demonstrators used to cover parts of the mall with antigovernment and anti-China slogans -- permeated the air.
Later, protesters built another barricade outside the mall and set it ablaze before riot police fired tear gas and chased protesters around the vicinity of the mall and its surrounding park and town hall. Protesters hurled trash cans and other debris at police from an elevated walkway. Most of the crowd dispersed before nightfall.
The scuffles on the 16th straight weekend of protests create a challenge for authorities ahead of two crucial anniversaries that are expected to draw huge crowds. This coming weekend will mark the fifth anniversary of the beginning of the pro-democracy protests. Some of the posters put up on Sunday called for the whole city on Oct. 1 to wear black, the unofficial color of the protests.
The mood on the ground is creating more tension. Protesters' use of firebombs has increased, and a police officers' association warned that officers could respond with live ammunition. Meanwhile, the government has resisted calls for a judge-led inquiry into incidents of police handling of the protests.
This month, the city's leader, Carrie Lam, acceded to one of the protesters' five demands: the withdrawal of an extradition bill that would have allowed for suspects to be tried on the mainland. But demonstrators have said they wouldn't back down until their other demands are met. They include democratic overhauls and amnesty for protesters. They also include an independent investigation into how police have handled the protests, something public polls have consistently shown to be a top concern. Mrs. Lam has said an existing police-commission inquiry is sufficient.
New Town Plaza was the scene of protests on July 14, which saw riot police clash with demonstrators while families and shoppers were still inside. Residents were angry at mall manager Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. because police had been let in. The company didn't answer phone calls outside regular business hours on Sunday.
Earlier Sunday, hundreds of residents gathered in the mall's atrium. They hung banners calling for support for the protesters and pointing to China's suppression of Tibet and Xinjiang. Anti-China stickers, posters and spray-painted slogans were visible throughout the mall. At one point, protesters defaced and stepped on the Chinese national flag, dragging it around the mall before they threw it into a nearby river.
Some protesters donned hard hats and masks and rushed through the crowd, as news of the riot police's arrival circulated. Shops including Zara and cosmetics outlet Chanel Beaute that had remained open during the rally quickly closed as the scuffles began and mall management asked shoppers to calmly leave.
""Every time the police come through there is a fight,"" said a 68-year-old grandmother surnamed Ko. She said she had the day off from taking care of her grandchildren and came because she wanted to show support for the young people on the front lines. ""The future belongs to them,"" she said. ""The government needs to listen to their demands.""

REVIEW --- Word on the Street: A Banner for Tech Nerds With A Political Agenda,"In a new book, Reuters reporter Joseph Menn details how a coterie of tech hobbyists in Texas in the 1980s grew into an influential organization, called the Cult of the Dead Cow, that promoted the use of computer hacking for political ends -- or ""hacktivism,"" as they called it.
Mr. Menn also revealed in ""Cult of the Dead Cow: How the Original Hacking Supergroup Might Just Save the World"" that Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman running for president, was a member of the collective starting in his teenage years. Mr. O'Rourke contributed anarchic writing under the pseudonym ""Psychedelic Warlord"" to the group, also known as cDc.
The hacking in which the cDc originally engaged seems quaint in retrospect, mostly about finding ways to steal long-distance phone service to use for dial-up modems. That activity harks back to the original ""hackers,"" a term originated by an undergraduate group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology called the Tech Model Railroad Club that tinkered with technology starting in the 1950s. Club minutes from 1955 include the earliest known use of ""hacking"" in the tech-related sense: ""Mr. Eccles requests that anyone working or hacking on the electrical system turn the power off to avoid fuse blowing."" In a 1959 dictionary of terms, the club defined a ""hack"" as ""something done without constructive end"" or ""a project undertaken on bad self-advice.""
Early ""hacking"" was motivated by a joyous sense of prankishness, as when the club would hack into the school's phone system (which later got its own name, ""phreaking""). But when the term was adapted for the computer age, it was used for more devious aims. ""Hacking"" became understood to mean the subversion of computer systems by unauthorized access. The motivation could be the thrill of the chase, but hacking could also be done for personal gain, for espionage -- or as a form of protest.
It was this last type of hacking that the Cult of the Dead Cow began advocating in the 1990s under the banner ""hacktivism,"" a blend of ""hack"" and ""activism."" The cDc wasn't the first to come up with the word. In June 1995, an article in the Village Voice made a reference to ""a local computer hacktivist."" That November, the Minneapolis-based magazine InfoNation carried an article discussing ""the uprising of low-fi activism and hacker mentality, or 'hacktivism' if you will.""
But those passing uses were unknown to the members of the cDc when they began seeking a new way to brand their activities in the summer of 1998. The group unveiled a tool called Back Orifice for hacking into Windows and was involved with Chinese dissidents that it dubbed ""The Hong Kong Blondes."" As Mr. Menn recounts, a member named Misha Kubecka, who went by the pseudonym Omega, was the first to propose the new term, writing, ""The word describes what the Hong Kong Blondes and cDc are doing together: Hacktivism."" The cDc's ""foreign minister"" Laird Brown, or Oxblood Ruffin, suggested spreading it far and wide.
A cDc post on July 15, 1998 provided the first public rollout. Aiming the post at journalists, Mike Seery (under the pseudonym Reid Fleming) defined ""hacktivism"" as ""a policy of hacking, phreaking, or creating technology to achieve a political or social goal.""
From then on, ""hacktivism"" would be the banner flown by cDc as well as later, more notorious, hacker collectives like Anonymous and its offshoot Lulz Security, both of which have exposed personal data and emails from major companies' files and supported the activities of Wikileaks.
While many argue about what exactly constitutes ""hacktivism,"" there's no doubt that the word has proved a rallying point for hackers who see their work as political protest.

Stocks Weaken as Retail Sales Slip,"Stocks slipped as economic data suggested consumers were holding back on spending amid trade tensions and a global economic slowdown.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 22.82 points, or 0.1%, to 27001.98. The S&P 500 dropped 5.99 points, or 0.2%, to 2989.69, led by the energy sector, which declined 1.5%. The Nasdaq Composite lost 24.52 points, or 0.3%, to 8124.18.
The Commerce Department reported that U.S. retail sales slipped 0.3% in September, missing the expectations of economists polled by The Wall Street Journal who had predicted a 0.2% increase.
That fueled anxiety about growth in the U.S. and overseas. The International Monetary Fund this week cut its global gross domestic product forecast for 2019 to 3%, its lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis, citing trade tensions and geopolitics. It projected 3.4% growth in 2020.
""Right now, you're not getting any relief from this trade war,"" said Edward Moya, an analyst at foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda. ""Until there is something that is signed and something the market believes is achievable, you're not going to see any forecasts have any upgrades.""
Investors continue to scrutinize details of the ""phase one"" trade deal between the U.S. and China last week.
Despite a Chinese promise to buy more U.S. farm products, questions remain over how much, the time frame for purchases and what the U.S. might have to give in return.
The U.S. still plans to impose new 15% tariffs on $156 billion in consumer goods starting Dec. 15.
Uncertainty over the trade war and global economy is prompting companies to trim growth expectations, according to the Federal Reserve's ""beige book,"" which was released Wednesday afternoon. Some manufacturing companies cut head count. Some companies cut worker hours.
""That could be the transmission channel in which the slowdown intensifies,"" said Ben May, director of global macro research at Oxford Economics.
Despite those worries, U.S. stock indexes remain near record highs, and strong earnings reports drove gains in many individual stocks.
Bank of America shares rose 44 cents, or 1.5%, to $30.17 as the bank reported gains in its consumer, wealth and commercial businesses. PNC Financial Services Group, Bank of New York Mellon and U.S. Bancorp also rose after reporting results.
After the close of regular trading, shares of Netflix rose 8% after the company reported fewer new subscribers than expected but revenue and earnings that rose sharply.
International Business Machines dropped 3.4% after reporting profit fell 38%.
In other corporate news, shares of McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health rallied after The Wall Street Journal reported they were in talks to settle opioid litigation.
Despite the downbeat report on consumer spending, consumer-related stocks ticked higher. General Motors rose 39 cents, or 1.1%, to $36.65 on reports of a tentative deal with its striking union workers. Advance Auto Parts and BorgWarner rose nearly 2%
U.S. crude oil added 1% to $53.36 a barrel, gold gained 0.7% to $1,488 a troy ounce and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.75% from 1.77% on Tuesday.
Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.1% as talks toward a draft plan for Britain to leave the European Union continued. Investors had been anticipating positive news to emerge overnight but were disappointed by a lack of progress Wednesday, said Peter Dixon, a senior economist at Commerzbank.
""We were told there would be a deadline of midnight last night; both sides sounded very positive. Then we woke up and it was still a work in progress and I think that has changed investors' perceptions of where we are,"" he said.
The British pound continued climbing, rising 0.3%, while the FTSE 100 gauge for U.K. equities slipped 0.6%.
The WSJ Dollar Index fell 0.19 point, or 0.2%, to 91.18.
Chinese stocks edged lower on concerns that tensions with the U.S. over the Hong Kong protests would make striking a trade deal more complicated.
The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.4% after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a series of bills backing pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, drawing a strong rebuke from China.
At midday Thursday in Tokyo, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was up 0.1%. Also early in the day, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 1%, South Korea's Kospi was down 0.2% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was down 0.5%.

U.S. News: U.S. Starts Security Review Of TikTok,"The U.S. has undertaken a national security review of the popular video-sharing app TikTok, following concerns expressed by U.S. senators that the Chinese-owned company was censoring content to appease Beijing, according to a person familiar with the matter.
TikTok said it couldn't ""comment on ongoing regulatory processes,"" but said it ""has made clear that we have no higher priority than earning the trust of users and regulators in the U.S. Part of that effort includes working with Congress and we are committed to doing so.""
Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) last month called for a review of the 2017 acquisition that enabled the Chinese owner of TikTok to expand its reach in the U.S.
In a letter to the Treasury Department, Mr. Rubio cited ""growing evidence"" that TikTok's platform is censoring content as China has sought to block sympathetic coverage of protests in Hong Kong and reports about China's treatment of Muslim minorities, among other moves.
Last week, Sens. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) also asked the acting director of national intelligence to conduct an assessment of the national security risks of TikTok.
""The U.S. government investigation into TikTok's Beijing-based parent company, if true, is welcome news,"" Mr. Schumer said. ""This new investigation is validation of our concern that apps like TikTok -- that store massive amounts of personal data accessible to foreign governments -- may pose serious risks to millions of Americans and deserve greater scrutiny.""

Banking & Finance: Hong Kong Exchange CEO Confronts China Challenge --- Potential threat by Beijing to capitalist hub looms over bid for London marketplace,"Charles Li, the head of Hong Kong's stock exchange, has built his career and company's success on China. Now that could prove to be his biggest challenge.
The prospect of tighter control from Beijing is threatening the rule of law that underpins Hong Kong's role as a financial hub. And political and security concerns could help scuttle an unsolicited $36.6 billion offer for the London Stock Exchange Group Ltd., in what would be by far his biggest deal.
The timing of the approach to LSE was also notable. The surprise move was aimed at disrupting another deal that would effectively put the LSE out of bounds. But given shifting political winds, the exchange could also find in the future that it encounters a frostier reception in the West.
The 58-year-old Mr. Li is a voluble former lawyer, banker, journalist and oil worker. For much of his decadelong tenure as chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., he has focused on building closer ties between the exchange and its mainland Chinese counterparts, staking its growth on China's increasing wealth and global influence.
On Wednesday, Mr. Li sought to sell the media on the benefits of uniting the Hong Kong and London exchanges into a group with an 18-hour trading day, in a deal that would help deepen the connections between China and global markets.
Speaking from a London office a few minutes' walk from the LSE's headquarters, he admitted to admiring LSE for months and described the saga as a corporate ""Romeo and Juliet"" story -- a typically colorful turn of phrase.
""He's a very successful salesman,"" said Christopher Cheung Wah-fung, a lawmaker in Hong Kong who represents the financial-services sector and is also chief executive of brokerage Christfund Securities. ""He always has a bunch of plausible theories to defend his arguments.""
HKEX didn't make Mr. Li available for comment.
The LSE proposal, the latest in a long line of mooted deals involving the U.K. exchange, has run immediately into skepticism.
""It's a bold move and one that appears to have a low chance of success,"" said Neil Wilson, an analyst at Safecap Investment Ltd.'s Markets.com.
Mr. Li has spent a decade talking about the opportunities from the two-way internationalization of China's capital markets, and joining forces with LSE could be the biggest step in realizing that vision, according to a person close to him.
One hurdle will be persuading the target's board and shareholders to scrap LSE's existing $14.5 billion deal to buy financial-information provider Refinitiv Holdings Ltd.
Exchange deals are often also fraught with political risk. The U.K. government could veto this deal because LSE forms a critical part of the country's financial infrastructure, according to people familiar with the matter.
Meanwhile, worries are intensifying in Hong Kong financial circles over Beijing's increasing encroachment on the territory, which has helped fuel months of increasingly violent protests. Half of the Hong Kong exchange's board, excluding the CEO, is appointed by the Hong Kong government, which could potentially add to the sensitivity.
HKEX shares fell 3.5% on Thursday as its own investors digested the deal.
Mr. Li got his start as an offshore oil worker in mainland China before entering college. He spent a few years as a journalist working for China Daily, a state mouthpiece, and later earned a master's degree in journalism at the University of Alabama.
He pivoted again and earned a law degree from Columbia University. He worked at law firms in New York before joined Merrill Lynch China in 1994, becoming its president in 1999. He joined J.P. Morgan China as its chairman in 2003.
Unlike many Western exchanges, HKEX faces little competition in its home market for share trading, futures or clearing, and is thus highly profitable.
That means it has felt less pressure than European or U.S. rivals to diversify into areas like compiling indexes, or to gain scale through acquisitions.
The only notable overseas acquisition came in 2012, when it bought the London Metal Exchange for $2.12 billion.
That restraint has paid off so far. Since Mr. Li took the helm in January 2010, the gain in the company's shares has more than doubled that of the benchmark Hang Seng Index. The group has a market value of roughly $38 billion, according to FactSet.
Instead, Mr. Li has focused partly on linking mainland China with global markets. The exchange introduced Stock Connect in 2014, a trading link giving foreign investors access to shares in Shanghai and Shenzhen, and letting mainland investors trade in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong's Violent Unrest Grows As Beijing Marks Communist Rule,"HONG KONG -- A police officer shot a young antigovernment protester in the chest during the worst day of violent unrest to hit Hong Kong in half a century, as Beijing celebrated the 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule in mainland China.
Video footage on Tuesday showed an officer firing his pistol at close range after Tsang Chi-kin, an 18-year-old high-school student, swung at him with a metal bar. Other footage showed the protester on the ground with blood spilling from his chest.
The police confirmed the shooting, saying the officer had fired at Mr. Tsang in self defense. The teenager underwent emergency surgery and health officials said his condition was critical early Wednesday.
The incident -- the first of its kind since protests erupted in the city in early June -- is likely to further inflame the antigovernment movement, which was sparked by opposition to a bill allowing extradition to China. The Hong Kong government in September scrapped the proposal and has appealed for calm, but the movement has drawn momentum from what protesters allege to be police brutality and a lack of accountability.
Efforts to ease tensions and weaken protests before Tuesday's anniversary failed, with events in the city upstaging the celebrations.
The violence marked an embarrassment for Beijing, souring its National Day festivities despite President Xi Jinping's repeated demands for smooth celebrations. The ferocity and intensity of the clashes have left Mr. Xi with a dilemma as to how the uprising can be contained.
While Beijing has indicated its preference to let the city's government take the lead in resolving the crisis, mainland officials have warned that they reserve the right to step in if the situation gets out of hand. Some Chinese academics have urged Hong Kong's government to consider invoking emergency laws that would allow local police to take tougher measures to restore order, including expanded arrest powers, asserting control over transportation and censoring media.
The protests are aimed at a perceived erosion of the city's liberties by China and the tactics of the city's police, who have angered people across Hong Kong after a number of violent incidents were caught on video.
""It's a dark turn,"" Ho-Fung Hung, a political-economy professor at Johns Hopkins University, said of the shooting. ""The movement and the conflict has passed the point of no return, and the use of live ammunition is adding fuel to the fire.""
Besides the bill's withdrawal, protesters have four other demands. Chief among them is the establishment of a judge-led commission to investigate violent behavior by the police. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has resisted appointing such a commission while another policy inquiry plays out. There are no active negotiations to resolve differences between the protesters and the government.
In response to the police shooting of Mr. Tsang, internet users on LIHKG, a Reddit-like news site popular among protesters, called for more people to support a citywide strike planned for Wednesday. ""There will be a second shot after the first one was fired,"" one post read.
Pro-government lawmakers urged the government to invoke sweeping emergency powers to quell the unrest, a move the government has described during the current unrest as a last resort. Such powers were previously invoked in 1967 when Hong Kong was a British colony and police shot leftist Chinese protesters who revolted while China was in the tumult of the Cultural Revolution.
Tuesday's shooting happened as tens of thousands of demonstrators poured into the streets of Hong Kong's main business districts and turned out in suburbs across the territory in anti-China counter-rallies to the National Day celebrations. Their tactics left police thinly stretched and outmatched in spots, leading to pitched battles.
Police said they fired live ammunition six times over the course of the day. More than 180 arrests were made, police said. Health officials said 74 people, aged from 11 to 75, were hospitalized early Wednesday, including two in critical condition.
Shortly after reports of the shooting -- which occurred in the western district of Tsuen Wan -- emerged, huge numbers of police swept through central districts on Hong Kong island to break up protesters that joined the day's biggest march, which police had banned.
A woman originally from the U.K. fell to the ground after being hit by a projectile police fired outside Admiralty subway station. She said she had lived in Hong Kong for 25 years. ""I just don't want to see this,"" she said. ""This is my home; this is my children's home.""
Clashes raged across more than a dozen districts across the city, many simultaneously. As protesters were alerted to the shooting on their smartphones, there was temporary quiet at some battlegrounds, though skirmishes continued into the evening.
In a rare public address, the city's police chief, Stephen Lo, blamed violent protesters for endangering officers' lives and forcing them to draw guns.
""Today is really sad for me,"" said Mr. Lo, referring to widespread chaos that saw subway stations attacked and storefronts -- particularly businesses perceived as being pro-China -- smashed. Arrests were made for rioting, unauthorized assembly, attacking officers and carrying offensive weapons, he said.
An initial assessment of the shooting in a life-threatening situation made it seem to be legal and reasonable, he said, though the force would investigate further.
""We are heartbroken and worried,"" Mr. Lo said of the teenager's injuries. ""I believe that no one would like to see other people injured -- no matter if they are officers, reporters or protesters.""
The scenes in Hong Kong contrasted with colorful, jubilant anniversary celebrations in Beijing that included the country's biggest-ever military parade to showcase the nation's might.
Mrs. Lam was seen in Beijing smiling as she watched the parade, which featured a Hong Kong float carrying a golden egg, a reference to the city's science park. In Hong Kong, her deputy, Matthew Cheung, led a Chinese-flag-raising ceremony in the morning, telling guests that Hong Kong people were ""shocked and saddened by the violence that has turned the city that we call home into an unfamiliar place.""
Mr. Xi said during the Beijing festivities that ""no force can shake the great foundation of our nation"" and that it remained committed to the strategy of peaceful unification and ""One Country, Two Systems,"" an arrangement that gives Hong Kong more autonomy than in the mainland.
Demonstrators in Hong Kong were intent on marring the big day, expressing opposition to Mr. Xi's vision of a united country. The city was in virtual lockdown for most of the day, with dozens of malls and more than half the city's subway stations shuttered by the evening.
In Sha Tin, the city's largest residential district, protesters seized overpasses and rained rocks, Molotov cocktails and full soda and beer cans down on outnumbered police. Police responded with multiple rounds of tear gas and other projectiles.
About 20 miles away in Tuen Mun, protesters armed with sticks and umbrellas charged a small contingent of police in riot gear. The police, cornered against a building, fought back with batons and pepper spray but were quickly overwhelmed and forced to retreat inside. Police said protesters in the neighborhood also threw corrosive fluid on officers.
Thousands more protesters filled a main road through the heavily populated district of Kowloon, across the harbor from downtown Hong Kong, where thousands more people occupied streets until being cleared as water cannon and riot police firing tear gas advanced.
""For Hong Kong people, there's nothing to celebrate today,"" said Bonnie Leung, who was in the leadership of the Civil Human Rights Front when the group applied for police permission to stage a march on Tuesday, but was denied.
""China has a habit of silencing people during 'celebrations' like National Day to create a cosmetic peaceful scene,"" she said. ""It might work in Beijing, but it would never work in Hong Kong.""

Life & Arts: Zegna Ads Court A Sensitive 'Modern Man',"Luxury Italian clothier Ermenegildo Zegna is dumping the alpha male and betting on a man who can still pay top dollar but is unafraid of showing his sensitive side.
After decades as the suitmaker of Wall Street executives and high-profile figures, Zegna is tailoring its clothes and message, with more soft looks and introspective ad campaigns that re-examine manliness and subtly challenge toxic masculinity.
Print and video ads rolling out Thursday have thoughtful figures in sweaters and scarves, a contrast with the steely males decked out in suits and ties in older Zegna ads.
Zegna is making the shift alongside other efforts to portray manhood in a more-evolved way amid the #MeToo movement and global conversations about macho culture. The Milan-based company, which was founded in 1910, wants the new message to engage younger men, who might not see masculinity as their fathers and grandfathers did.
""Right now, people across the globe -- men and women -- are talking about what masculinity looks like today, and I think Zegna has to be a part of this dialogue,"" said Ermenegildo Zegna, chief executive of the Ermenegildo Zegna Group, and grandson of the founder. The 63-year-old Mr. Zegna is part of the third generation running the company, which has about $1.3 billion in annual revenue and 480 stores around the world.
""When I am out meeting customers or visiting our stores, I regularly find myself engaged in conversations about how Zegna can dress the 'modern man,'"" he said. ""What this shows me is that people are interested in this idea of modern masculinity.""
Zegna's shift comes as other brands have taken stands on hot-button social issues.
Some have faced a backlash from customers. Procter & Gamble's Gillette took on toxic masculinity this year with an ad addressing sexual harassment, bullying and other behaviors. It upset some people, who tweeted photos or videos of themselves throwing their Gillette razors in trash cans or tearing them apart, using hashtags like #BoycottGillette and #GilletteFail. Gillette stood its ground.
Nike Inc.'s ad campaign featuring former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who led player protests for racial justice during pregame national anthems, sparked praise and boycott threats when it made its debut last September. Budweiser's 2017 Super Bowl ad recounting the immigration of Adolphus Busch, co-founder of parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev NV, ran amid a U.S. debate over immigration and on the heels of President Donald Trump's election.
Budweiser said it didn't intend the spot to be political but some viewers criticized the company for appearing to take a jab at President Trump or advocate for immigration. Others defended the ad.
""You're going to lose some customers and you're going to win some. The question is how much are you going to lose or how much are you going to gain"" in new customers, said Denver D'Rozario, a professor of marketing at Howard University's School of Business. ""Brands taking stands on important social issues are hoping that if they take the right stand, they're known as a brand that is in tune with what's happening.""
Zegna's ""What Does It Mean To Be A Man Today?"" ad campaign highlights nontraditional aspects of manhood such as vulnerability, patience, playfulness and courtesy. The videos launch Thursday on YouTube and Zegna's website.
The print ads, which debut the same day, star Mahershala Ali, the Oscar-winning actor from ""Green Book"" and ""Moonlight"" and Nicholas Tse, the Hong Kong-born actor, martial artist and singer. The company says the two embody many shades of masculinity.
In one spot, a pensive Mr. Ali holds a blossom as he pauses on a balcony. The caption reads ""Love makes a man."" In another, he smiles and plays with toy cars, alongside the caption ""Playfulness makes a man.""
Many of the clothes in the campaign are relaxed, with more sweaters and sport coats than business suits and ties. They are a contrast with Zegna's older ads, which were stark, typically featuring serious-looking male models in business suits and ties stiffly standing or sitting. Their look said they mean business.
Andrew Smiler, author of ""Is Masculinity Toxic? A primer for the 21st Century,"" said that in general ""to have a high-end suit brand reach out to other types of masculinity to reflect cultural change is just good business.""
Professor D'Rozario said that addressing toxic masculinity also could appeal to women, who can influence what the men in their lives buy.
Zegna said it is neither demonizing men nor telling them how to behave. ""I want to be clear. We don't want to define what masculinity is or isn't,"" said artistic director Alessandro Sartori. ""We want to open a conversation. There are so many different aspects of masculinity.""
As to a possible backlash from longtime customers, Mr. Zegna said, ""I am hopeful that our clients understand this approach and recognize what we are trying to accomplish with this campaign.""
On Thursday night at a home in New York, Zegna will host a conversation about masculinity in the 21st century with Mr. Ali and Mr. Sartori, moderated by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, who is a venture investor and the husband of tennis superstar Serena Williams.
Mr. Ohanian, who has spoken about paternal leave and work-family balance, will appear in Zegna videos on masculinity. ""I know exactly what it takes to be a business leader, at least in tech, and I believe in all the things I'm advocating for because they are part of the recipe for my success,"" Mr. Ohanian said.
Mr. Zegna said the messaging is addressed ""to humanity in general,"" including the socially conscious younger generation.
""This is not a conversation about men that should be had only by men,"" he said. ""We are inviting men and women of different generations around the world to consider this important question.""

Street Battles Erupt At Hong Kong Protests,"HONG KONG -- Tens of thousands of protesters poured onto Hong Kong's streets on Sunday, with the fiercest battles in weeks breaking out as demonstrators faced off with police and shouted anti-party slogans ahead of Tuesday's 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China.
The protesters had planned to march to the government headquarters in the center of the city under the theme ""Global Anti-Totalitarianism Rally."" The police broke up the march at about 4 p.m., an hour or so after it began, engaging the protesters in urban street battles in several districts amid clouds of tear gas and bursts of rubber bullets. They made multiple arrests.
Protesters waved flags from different countries and international institutions, including the U.S. and the United Nations, appealing to the global community to stand with the city's antigovernment movement. Rallies were taking place or planned in dozens of cities around the world in solidarity with Hong Kong's protesters.
Hong Kong is in its 17th straight weekend of demonstrations, originally sparked by opposition to a proposed extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to be tried in the mainland's more opaque legal system. Although the city's government formally withdrew the bill this month, the continuing protest movement, which has widened to include other demands, has revealed deep-seated fears of China's tightening rule in the city.
The sustained size of the movement and the intense violence of the front-line confrontations with police threaten to mar China's anniversary celebrations. The movement is the highest-profile public challenge to President Xi Jinping since he rose to power in 2012.
Marchers vented their anger at Chinese banks, smashing and spray painting ATMs at the Bank of China and plastering the front of the Bank of Communications with posters comparing China to the Nazis; hurled bricks and Molotov cocktails at the government headquarters; burned the entrance of a metro station and set half a dozen large fires.
The police, for their part, started the day off with tear gas rounds almost immediately after the march began; fired jets of blue dye from water cannons; sent snatch teams in aggressive charges to make arrests; brought huge numbers of officers into the streets; and pepper-sprayed crowds of journalists and others as they tried to leave for the night.
The Hong Kong government has signaled its desire for reconciliation through dialogue in past weeks and hosted apublic forum with Chief Executive Carrie Lam on Thursday. But the continued volume and ferocity of the protests suggest the government's strategy is doing little to quell the unrest.
The organizers of Sunday's march, who didn't identify themselves publicly, didn't apply to the police department for permission, as organizers have for many previous rallies. Police tried to quell the demonstration before it began, firing tear gas and pepper spray in the center of the shopping district of Causeway Bay. Protesters began to march anyway, holding a giant yellow banner that said ""Restore Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Time.""
As they marched down one of the city's longest roads, they chanted slogans while breaking into song. The protest anthem's lyrics include the lines: ""Lift up your head and speak up, our voices will ring loud, in the hope that freedom will return here. . . . The sons and daughters march together for justice, a revolution of our time.""
A 15-year-old student, who gave his name as John, marched with a placard featuring an image of the anonymous ""Tank man,"" who stood alone before a column of Chinese army tanks in the aftermath of the deadly crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing.
""We are not radicals, we just want to fight for a better future,"" said John, who took the placard from other protesters who were distributing anti-Communist Party paraphernalia. He said the placard, captioned ""CCP Evil Dictatorship Party,"" reflected his misgivings about Communist rule and its impact on civil liberties in Hong Kong. ""We want to tell the world that the evils committed by the Communist Party could happen here, too,"" he said.
Along the demonstration route, protesters vandalized facades of mainland Chinese businesses, including outlets of state-owned banks, plastering them with anti-party placards and spray-painting protest slogans.
Police on Sunday appeared to be employing different crowd-control strategies than in previous weeks. They fired tear gas even before the rally was to begin, even though nonparticipants were milling around the busy shopping area. And, in contrast to previous instances in which police chased protesters, large groups of police in riot gear waited at intervals along the expected march route.
As police can hold arrested people for 48 hours without charge, those arrested Sunday could still be off the streets for Tuesday's national day public holiday.
In other districts, protesters vandalized subway stations and other structures, continuing an outburst of anger against the city's subway company, MTR Corp. In the Wan Chai station, protesters smashed the glass of an elevator and threw objects into the underground station from the street level.

World News: Taiwanese Demonstrate Solidarity,"TAIPEI -- Antigovernment protests in Hong Kong are stirring anti-China sentiment in a neighbor that is also wary of Beijing's growing clout.
A march in Taiwan's capital drew what organizers said were 100,000 people into the streets in solidarity with Hong Kong, which has endured 17 weeks of unrest underpinned by fear of the Chinese government's increasing reach into the city's affairs. Taipei police didn't give a crowd-size estimate.
The political turmoil in the former British colony is pushing Taiwan away from Chinese President Xi Jinping's plan to use the Hong Kong model of ""one country, two systems"" to bring the self-governed island of Taiwan under Beijing's rule. Rising opposition here is a setback for Mr. Xi's push for a reunification that is part of his grand vision to rejuvenate China.
On Sunday, some participants rallying in Taipei wore yellow helmets and gas masks -- symbols of Hong Kong's 2019 protests -- and waved giant black flags that read ""restore Hong Kong, the revolution of our times,"" before the march started outside Taiwan's legislative buildings. Some also waved green flags that embody the ideology of Taiwan independence, which Beijing won't countenance. The mostly black-clad crowds, braving the pouring rain as a typhoon approached, marched 2 miles through the government district of Taipei while chanting protest slogans.
Sunday's gathering was part of a global effort to support Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement and its fight against China's authority over the semiautonomous city. Thousands more gathered in four other Taiwanese cities for a march, rallies and a movie screening over the weekend.
Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, has been a vocal ally of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests. Ms. Tsai, who is seeking reelection next year, has criticized Beijing's handling of the protests in Hong Kong. In public remarks at the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's 33rd anniversary celebration on Saturday, she highlighted the threats and political intervention from across the Taiwan Strait.
""In the race of 2020, our rivals are not only within our country but more on the other side of the shore,"" Ms. Tsai said, adding that China wants to see ""Taiwan elect an administration that bows to Beijing and is afraid of purchasing fighter jets and supporting Hong Kong's democracy."" The Trump administration has agreed to sell Taiwan some $8 billion of F-16V fighter jets, a move China opposes.
Even the China-friendly Nationalist Party (KMT) spoke against the application of ""one country two systems"" framework for Taiwan. KMT leader Wu Den-yih said in a video posted to the opposition party's verified Facebook page on Sunday that the Republic of China -- Taiwan's formal name -- is ""a sovereign and independent country. . .and can't be compared with Hong Kong.""
Mr. Wu said he opposed police using harsh means to disperse crowds in Hong Kong.
Some attendees at Sunday's event said they thought Taiwan and Hong Kong faced similar problems, as China continues to expand its reach and pressures other countries not to recognize Taiwan's sovereignty.

REVIEW --- Has Xi Stirred a Backlash?,"[China's leader is using his country's new might to challenge the Western-led global order -- spurring an argument at home and risking pushback around the world.]
When relations between China and the West frayed in the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping gave guidance that set Beijing's course for several decades. ""Hide our capacities and bide our time, be good at maintaining a low profile and never claim leadership,"" he urged. As Deng and his successors opened China up to the world and avoided international conflicts, they sparked an economic miracle that propelled hundreds of millions out of poverty.
A very different attitude increasingly prevails in Beijing. With China's economy already larger than America's by some measures, President Xi Jinping has moved away from his predecessors' caution. While stifling dissent at home, he has harnessed China's new might to pose challenges to the Western-led international order -- an effort that is generating both a global pushback against Chinese influence and a policy debate inside China and abroad. The protests in Hong Kong that shut down its airport this week -- spurred, in part, by local frustration over Beijing's eroding of the ""one country, two systems"" pledge made by Deng in the 1980s -- add a fresh threat to China's economy and prestige.
Has Mr. Xi made a mistake in asserting greater world-power status for China to match its economic might? Should the country have waited another decade or two, biding its time until China's leading edge in technology and global trade became unassailable?
China's assertiveness predates Mr. Xi's ascent to power in 2012. But the 66-year-old leader has turned this new nationalism into the hallmark of his presidency. As far back as his 2013 summit meeting with President Barack Obama in California, U.S. officials were surprised by what they understood as Mr. Xi's vision to essentially divide the world into two spheres of influence, with China overseeing Asia in exchange for not challenging U.S. dominance elsewhere.
In a 2017 speech to the Communist Party Congress, Mr. Xi celebrated the fact that China ""has stood up, grown rich and is becoming strong."" Beijing's ultimate goal, he added, was to become a ""global leader in terms of composite national strength and international influence.""
Such a move away from China's previous restraint was inevitable, argues Wang Huiyao, a counselor to China's State Council, the body that unites China's government ministers. The world has changed so much since Deng's times, when China's economy wasn't even among the world's top 10, that the ""low profile"" advice no longer makes sense, he said. ""China is already big in size,"" he added. ""China's influence and China's economic power is there. You cannot hide that.""
Still, the ferocity of the global reaction to China's new swagger has taken many Chinese officials by surprise. ""It's now politically correct to bash China,"" added Mr. Wang, who also serves as president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing. ""China didn't say it will conquer the world. It said it is building a community of shared future for mankind. But somehow, the message didn't get across, and there is quite a big backlash.""
In the U.S., resistance to China's international expansion, trade practices and military moves -- highlighted by Donald Trump in his 2016 campaign -- has now solidified into a bipartisan consensus. Even as the two countries meet to discuss trade issues, the trade war has escalated in recent weeks as Beijing responded to new U.S. tariffs by banning the import of American agricultural products and Washington, angered by the devaluation of the yuan, labeled China a currency manipulator. Democratic and Republican congressional leaders have also expressed support for the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, warning Beijing against a violent crackdown.
In Europe, China is now seen less as a benign power pursuing stability and prosperity than as ""a systemic rival promoting alternative models of governance,"" as the European Union declared in March.
Meanwhile, in the developing world, controversies have grown around Mr. Xi's ambitious Belt and Road initiative, which is meant to seed billions of dollars in Chinese investment across the globe. From Malaysia to the Maldives, politicians have won office partly by challenging the corruption and debt surrounding many Chinese projects.
""The transition from a low-profile international strategy to all-out assertiveness and activism was premature, and China was not really prepared to embark on such a dramatic transition,"" said Li Mingjiang, coordinator of the China program at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.
The great question raised by China's new posture is whether it can navigate the shift in its relative power without spiraling into an outright confrontation with the U.S. Such a clash could handicap the world's two largest economies -- and, in the worst-case scenario now being openly discussed by policy makers on both sides of the Pacific, even throw Asia into a major war.
""The rise of China's power is not just about glory, it is also destined to be risky,"" said Zhu Feng, director of the Institute of International Studies at Nanjing University.
When Deng took over in 1978, China was emerging from the horrors of famine and the Cultural Revolution; the country had been isolated for decades. Jettisoning much of communist dogma, he urged the Chinese to get rich and worked to integrate the country into the global market. The economy soared, and many Western leaders assumed that, over time, China's political system would open up too.
The 2008 financial crisis, which Beijing helped to alleviate by pumping liquidity into Western markets, shook such beliefs. The crisis convinced many in China's establishment that the Western system was about to collapse -- and that the time had come for Beijing to emerge from the shadows and propose an alternative.
""In 2008, socialism with Chinese characteristics saved capitalism,"" said Hu Angang, dean of the Institute for Contemporary China Studies at Tsinghua University in Beijing and an influential voice in China's hawkish policy circles. ""Before 2008, many Chinese economists saw the U.S. as the best model for macroeconomic regulation. But the financial crisis broke their perceptions.""
In parallel with a popular crackdown on widespread corruption, Mr. Xi has reasserted Communist Party control over China's society and economy, including private enterprises. He has eliminated term limits for his own rule, accelerated China's military buildup and authorized the draconian repression of Muslims in the western Xinjiang region.
Criticism of Mr. Xi's harder line is rare in China's tightly controlled press and censored social media. But many influential liberal voices in the country's foreign-policy establishment, as well as among its business elites, continue to warn of the perils ahead -- and to call for a course correction.
""China should now use a new type of taking a low profile, should use at least five-six years to make a sufficient strategic retrenchment,"" said Shi Yinhong, another adviser to the State Council and a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. ""China, together with its strong achievements, jumped too fast and too quickly on the strategic front."" Deng Xiaoping's elderly son, Deng Pufang, made a similar point in a November speech, warning that China ""should keep a sober mind and know our own place.""
How much Mr. Xi is listening to advice to slow down isn't clear. ""Xi Jinping has a tight grip of control over the Chinese system, but he has to be attentive,"" said Ryan Hass, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who worked on China policy at the National Security Council from 2013-17. ""There is definitely grumbling and some discontent about the direction where China is headed at the moment. I don't think it has yet reached the point where it will compel the leadership to adjust the direction where they are headed, but it is not insignificant.""
The voices of doves in China's policy community, state-run think tanks and private businesses are at least partially offset by the cries of nationalist hawks. The latter group includes retired generals who have recently urged Beijing to take an even more aggressive approach, including invading Taiwan and sinking U.S. aircraft carriers. In a June speech at a conference attended by his U.S. counterpart, Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe vowed that Beijing wouldn't succumb to American pressure. ""The more severe the pressure and difficulties are, the stronger and braver the Chinese people become. Adversity only brings our nation greater solidarity and strength,"" Gen. Wei said. ""As for what the general public of China says these days: A talk? Welcome. A fight? Ready. Bully us? No way.""
As trade tensions with Washington intensified this summer, many editorials in Beijing's government publications zeroed in on so-called ""capitulators"" who argue for a softer stance toward the U.S. and a less assertive foreign policy, accusing them of lacking faith in China's abilities and of betraying the country's national interests. ""Yes, the elites are being cautious -- but if you talk to people on the street, that's very different,"" a senior Chinese military official said. ""They want more.""
But China's power has limits. The Chinese military, while rapidly modernizing, lacks combat experience. The new, more muscular posture adopted by China's diplomatic service has led to several blunders; recent attempts by Chinese embassies from Moscow to Rome to bully local media backfired badly. And despite historic strides in development -- including new airports, railroads and highways that often put America's decaying infrastructure to shame -- China remains a middle-income country, with a per capita GDP roughly the same as Mexico's.
Moreover, while China is a leader in some industries of the future, such as 5G and artificial intelligence, the country remains dependent on technology flows from the U.S. and other Western countries. Recent measures taken by Washington and its allies against two Chinese telecommunications firms, Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp., have fostered fears that the West seeks to choke off China's path to further technological advances.
""China needs reasonable space for its development,"" said Ni Jianjun of CICIR, a think tank affiliated with China's Ministry of State Security. ""China initially hoped to find a comfortable spot in the existing international system, but it is finding it to be more and more difficult, with more and more resistance.""
Many countries are suspicious of China's intentions because Beijing has been deliberately vague about how it sees its new role in the world. China gives assurances about ""win-win"" cooperation and its commitment to avoiding hegemony even as it increasingly tries to intimidate smaller countries.
""China isn't a world leader. China has never been a world leader. It's a totally new challenge for China,"" said Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor of international studies at Renmin University. ""There is a number of things China needs to think about: whether the international community or at least the majority of it welcomes China's leadership, and whether China's political system can sustain world leadership.""
Throughout history, China's relationship with the world -- when the country wasn't enduring foreign invasions itself -- was often that of a central empire surrounded by friendly vassal states, which lived by their own rules as long as they paid tribute and complied with China's aims. In some ways, this seems to be Beijing's aspiration today, at least when it comes to China's own neighborhood.
""China is not seeking to change the way Australia or Britain is governed. What it wants is [for] foreign governments to pay respect and be supportive of what it seeks. It wants to be able to achieve its goals with the minimum of opposition,"" said Malcolm Turnbull, who served until last year as Australia's prime minister. In that pursuit, China's recent behavior -- particularly its aggressive military posture in the contested South China Sea -- has been counterproductive, Mr. Turnbull added: ""They've pushed their neighbors, including Vietnam, closer and closer to the U.S. security orbit.""
Indeed, hardly any neighbor of China -- with the notable exception of an increasingly friendly and dependent Russia -- has been spared its wrath in recent years, and not just in the South China Sea. Landlocked Mongolia saw vital border traffic stall after the Dalai Lama visited the country in 2016 and had to promise Beijing that the Tibetan spiritual leader would never return. India and China came close to a military clash at their disputed frontier in the Himalayas in 2017. That same year, Seoul's decision to deploy a U.S. antiballistic missile defense system prompted a Chinese campaign against South Korean companies and products. Australia's coal shipments were subjected to restrictions earlier this year after it banned Huawei from its 5G network. And two Canadian citizens have been jailed on national-security charges since December after Canada detained Huawei's CFO, Meng Wanzhou, on a U.S. extradition request.
""Now that China is a major power with the second-largest defense budget in the world, its words and actions are seen differently,"" Singapore's prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, said in a recent speech. ""To grow its international influence beyond hard power, China needs to wield this strength with restraint and legitimacy.""
Just how carefully Mr. Xi's China wields this influence -- and deals with Western attempts to offset it -- will be a crucial global issue for years to come. ""The hope is that China learns some of the lessons of imperialism without having to go through the crises and conflicts that imperialism traditionally provokes,"" said Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at the Australian National University. ""But that will be a set of choices for China to make -- and it will depend on the quality of debate and decision-making inside China.""

I first met Mr. Law, 26, in June, during the first week of Hong Kong's protests. He scarfed down a cinnamon danish at a Starbucks in the Sheung Wan district. With his glasses, lightly wrinkled T-shirt and backpack, he had the sleep-deprived demeanor of a student during finals week. His youth belies his deep political experience.
As an undergraduate, Mr. Law helped lead Hong Kong's 2014 pro-democracy Umbrella Movement, the precursor to today's protests. ""I didn't have much time to study,"" he says, sounding genuinely apologetic. He later became the youngest person ever elected to Hong Kong's Legislative Council. That drew the eye -- and the ire -- of Beijing, which intervened to have him unseated and imprisoned.
Mr. Law insisted in June that most Hong Kong youths share his yearning for democracy and fear of Chinese communism. His peers have proved him right. The political crisis began when the Legislative Council, dominated by lawmakers sympathetic to Beijing, rushed to enact a bill that would allow China to extradite people in Hong Kong to the mainland. Millions took to the streets in protest. Chief Executive Carrie Lam backed down and declared the bill ""dead,"" but opponents are not reassured because she hasn't withdrawn it fully. She has also refused protesters' demands to resign, to investigate police brutality against demonstrators, to release and exonerate those who have been arrested, and to retract claims that they were ""rioting"" on June 12.
Since June 9, Hong Kong police have arrested almost 600 people and fired more than 1,800 rounds of tear gas and 160 rubber bullets at demonstrators. ""I myself have been tear-gassed numerous times, and some cans of the tear gas exploded just by my feet,"" Mr. Law says. Earlier this week, he watched police on a high perch firing tear gas into the crowd below. He worries ""if they hit someone, and the particular person does not wear a helmet, then it will cause serious damage."" Thugs in plain clothes have beaten protesters and bystanders with batons and rods, sending dozens to the hospital. The pro-democracy camp suspects the attackers belong to organized-crime triads and acted with the approval of the government.
Is worse yet to come? On Monday Ms. Lam said that Hong Kong is ""on the verge of a very dangerous situation."" On Tuesday, the spokesman for China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council warned: ""Those who play with fire will perish by it."" On Wednesday, the office's director, Zhang Xiaoming, said the Hong Kong protests have ""the clear characteristics of a color revolution"" and that ""if the situation worsens further, and there is turmoil that the Hong Kong government is unable to control, the central government absolutely will not just watch without doing anything."" More than 10,000 mainland police conducted antiriot drills in nearby Shenzhen this week, squaring off against fake protesters who wore the same yellow hard hats and black T-shirts as Hong Kong's demonstrators.
Far from being intimidated, Mr. Law says, protesters are emboldened. The harsh response has compelled them to demand direct election of the chief executive and legislators. ""People clearly understand that if we don't have a responsible government that is accountable to the people, then this chaos could be repeated very easily because there's no checks and balances,"" he says. ""We're dealing with a government that does not listen to its people, so I think that is exactly why we should not stop -- because we've got such huge momentum, and people are getting clear that only by having a true democracy shall our rights be protected.""
Mr. Law argues that the Chinese have violated the treaty under which Britain handed Hong Kong over in 1997. ""Autonomy and democracy are the things that have been promised by China, and we haven't been asking for more,"" he says. ""But if such humble demands are not being met by them, it's easy to predict that people may ask more."" Still, he says: ""I don't think this has become a pro-independence movement.""
It has, however, become more aggressive in its tactics. Though the vast majority of protesters have been peaceful, some have resorted to disorderly behavior. Last month, some broke into the Legislative Council building and damaged property, and others defaced China's national emblem at the government's liaison office. Some have thrown bricks and Molotov cocktails.
Yet Mr. Law says even the most militant protesters have avoided damaging private property or putting bystanders in harm's way. That's ""such an important feature that we have to bear in mind because it shows these protesters are not out of order. These protests are directed to symbols of power and power itself."" It's a risky strategy: ""They've been charging protesters with rioting, which can lock them up in jail up to 10 years.""
Mr. Law's political evolution began not at home but in the classroom of a publicly subsidized pro-Beijing high school in Hong Kong. Chinese dissident and political prisoner Liu Xiaobo had won the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize for his Tiananmen Square activism and his role in drafting the Charter 08 manifesto. Mr. Law recalls his school principal condemning Liu, ""saying he was a traitor.""
The 17-year-old Nathan had never heard of Liu. Nor had he been taught much ""about democracy and human rights and liberalism,"" the principles espoused in Charter 08, he says. But the teen reasoned that ""people who are awarded with a Nobel Prize means that he or she has an excellent contribution in that area."" Moreover, he adds with a smirk, authorities' propaganda and attempts at brainwashing ""make people more curious about the things that they condemn."" So ""I decided to explore things."" He began to read about human rights, history and politics online, and what he learned shocked and troubled him. Eventually, it also drove him to activism.
Mr. Law's mother learned of his political activism in 2014 ""by watching television and seeing that I got arrested."" That was during the Umbrella Movement. Police held him only a few hours, but a difficult conversation awaited him at home. Both his parents had fled mainland China for Hong Kong, and they carried a ""refugee mentality -- stable life, taking care of your family, find a stable job, that's it,"" Mr. Law explains. ""They do not talk about politics"" and ""were very worried"" about his activism. ""They kept saying, 'You cannot mess with the Chinese government, with the Communist Party. They are way more awful than you expect.'""
Mr. Law was undeterred. After the Umbrella Movement receded, he and Joshua Wong founded the DemosistÅ , a pro-democracy political party, and ran for the Legislative Council in 2016. ""Most of the seats are basically reserved for Beijing,"" Mr. Law explains. ""So in every election, the pro-democracy camp wins by a majority, but in the council, we are a minority."" Mr. Wong, now 22, was disqualified for his youth, but Mr. Law won one of the few seats chosen by direct election.
At his induction ceremony, Mr. Law made clear that his loyalties were with Hong Kong, not Beijing. The oath of office has become ""a tool of the authorities,"" Mr. Law said, so ""while I will go through the necessary procedure, it doesn't mean that I will bend and bow to absolute authority . . . . I will never bear allegiance to the powers that be that kill their people. I will use my conscience to defend Hong Kong people."" He recited the prescribed oath, then added: ""Power returns to the people. Absolute and autocratic powers will not live forever. There should be democratic self-determination, and there will be continuous struggle.""
Thus ended Mr. Law's political career. Beijing issued an interpretation of the section of the Hong Kong Basic Law that pertains to oaths of office. Anyone who ""takes the oath in a manner which is not sincere or not solemn, shall be treated as declining to take the oath,"" Beijing decreed. Mr. Law was unseated, along with five other pro-democracy legislators. A month after his defenestration, Mr. Law was sentenced and imprisoned on charges dating back to his 2014 Umbrella Movement activism.
He spent two months at the Tong Fuk Correctional Institution on Lantau Island -- ""a great experience for me, actually,"" Mr. Law says. ""Spending time in jail is -- it's really hard to describe."" It ""basically isolates you from the rest of the world, and then they try to make you obedient by imposing all the restraints, all the rules, all the restrictions in jail."" He tried to look at it as ""kind of like training or testing for me."" He worked on cultivating mental strength, ""to be stable, be consistent, to face any difficulties that lie ahead."" He gained exposure to different swaths of Hong Kong society -- mafiosos, drug dealers, petty criminals. ""You know more about the world by staying in jail.""
Yet he hasn't lost interest in conventional education. This month he'll begin a graduate program in East Asian studies at Yale -- ""as long as they don't arrest me. I don't know."" He plans to do whatever he can to help the movement from New Haven, but a serious education is ""a very precious opportunity."" Mr. Law worries he'll be unable to return to Hong Kong after Yale, or that he won't recognize the place: ""Will the political severity and condition become worse in the future? I don't think that is a fantasy. That might happen if we face a true crackdown, and all of us face political retaliation coming from the Communist Party.""

World News: Cathay Pacific Chairman Resigns,"The chairman of Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. resigned, weeks after the chief executive quit when Beijing pressured the Hong Kong carrier because some of its employees took part in antigovernment protests.
John Slosar, who became chairman in 2014, will be replaced in November, the airline said. His designated successor is Patrick Healy, managing director of Swire Beverages in Hong Kong. The U.K.'s Swire Group is Cathay Pacific's largest shareholder.
The airline said Mr. Slosar was retiring and his departure wasn't related to ""disagreement with the board of the company."" Many staff took part in a general strike in August, and management initially took a neutral stance. China's aviation authority ordered the airline to remove employees involved in protests from flights to the mainland.

Luxury Investors Get a Wake-Up Call From China,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
A weaker yuan is a direct threat to the growth hopes of Europe's top luxury brands. It will force investors to take the sector's over-dependence on China more seriously.
European luxury stocks have fallen 7.5% since Friday morning, according to an index of 10 luxury names compiled by Heard on the Street. The wider Stoxx Europe index is down just 4%. The declines follow a period of remarkable resilience: Heard's luxury index is still up 24% in the year to date, despite tensions between the U.S. and China.
China's currency weakened below seven yuan to the dollar on Monday, the first time since 2008 that the Chinese central bank has allowed it to fall to this level. The decision not to defend the currency came just days after President Trump announced a 10% tariff on a further $300 billion of Chinese goods. China also is considering how to respond to violent protests in Hong Kong, one of the world's most important cities for luxury shopping.
Until now, investors have found it easy to ignore worsening relations between the U.S. and China. Most European designer brands do their manufacturing close to home, protecting them from the kind of direct tariffs that have hit car manufacturers like BMW. Nor does exporting handbags to China pose the kind of national-security threats that have hurt the U.S. semiconductor industry. Then luxury companies themselves reassured investors by reporting strong demand from Chinese shoppers in their quarterly updates last month.
But a falling yuan is different, directly eroding the purchasing power of Chinese consumers, who account for one-third of luxury-goods spending globally and the vast majority of its growth. After the yuan fell in 2015, growth across the industry ground to a halt.
Unrest in Hong Kong also is unhelpful for all the brands that pay exorbitant local rents. Watch stocks Richemont and Swatch are most exposed, given that the city was the biggest market for Swiss watches globally in the first half of 2019.
Luxury's so-called havens aren't proving as defensive as investors thought -- perhaps because they were previously such strong performers. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which owns Christian Dior and Celine as well as its namesake brands, was among the biggest decliners in the Euro Stoxx 50 Monday.
Even after the declines of recent days, European luxury stocks fetch an average of 26 times projected earnings, well above their five-year average of 22 times. Investors need to keep a close eye on the yuan in particular. With valuations so rich, the luxury sector looks vulnerable.

Notable & Quotable: 'Be Water',"Antony Dapiran writing for the New Statesman, Aug. 1:
The worldwide ""occupy"" movements following the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 served as the inspiration for Hong Kong's previous mass act of civil disobedience -- a series of protests known as ""Occupy Central"" or the ""Umbrella Movement"" -- in 2014. These protests adopted the ""occupation"" logic of the prior movements, with protesters occupying the city's main thoroughfares for 79 days in the hope that the disruption would force the government to the negotiating table.... This time around, Hong Kong's protesters are taking their inspiration from a source closer to home: local hero, kung-fu movie star Bruce Lee, who famously advised: ""Be Water.""
Hong Kong's young protesters are eschewing the fixed, immobile occupation strategies of the past, in favour of a highly mobile, agile style of protest. A rally may turn into a march; a march may begin in one direction and abruptly change to another direction; the focus of a particular protest action may only emerge in the course of the march itself. In recent protests, small sub-groups of protesters dispatched themselves to carry out targeted ""wildcat"" occupations of a government building, flooding the entrance lobbies, escalators and lifts. When the government declared the building closed and dismissed staff for the day, the protesters dispersed and moved on to their next target. As Bruce Lee said, ""Water can flow, or it can crash!"""
World News: China Digs In for Protracted Trade Fight --- Xi has little leeway for concessions that would undercut his strongman image,"BEIJING -- The volley-for-volley trade war between China and the U.S. is accelerating at a time when Chinese President Xi Jinping can ill afford to make concessions, raising the likelihood of a protracted struggle between the world's two biggest economies.
Mr. Xi is ordering a celebratory run-up to the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic in October, an event that Communist Party watchers and media say will showcase him as a strong leader of a powerful nation. With his government struggling to rejuvenate a sluggish economy and quell antigovernment protests in Hong Kong, Mr. Xi has little leeway to take steps that would undercut his strongman image.
China also doesn't want to be the party escalating tensions further. Throughout the trade fight it has waited for the U.S. to impose tariffs before retaliating, and Beijing believes it can wait for the tariffs to damage the U.S. economy and for the declining U.S. stock market to force President Trump into making concessions, according to officials and policy advisers.
In a move that eased market concerns, Beijing refrained from announcing countermeasures to the administration's designation of China as a currency manipulator Monday.
""The best retaliation is letting U.S. tariffs on China hurt the U.S.'s own economy,"" said Yu Yongding, an economist and adviser to Chinese policy makers.
The worsening in the more than year-old trade conflict means the U.S. has now imposed or is poised to impose tariffs on nearly all of the goods it imports from China, as part of the administration's bid to force Beijing to change rules and a subsidy-heavy economic model seen as unfair to foreign businesses. In its latest countermoves this week, China suspended purchases of U.S. agricultural products and weakened the Chinese currency to make its exports more competitive.
The trade fight now falls into a lengthening list of irritants -- from cybersecurity to theft of technology and China's infrastructure-building program overseas.
""Trump's actions have seriously agitated the Chinese leadership, who now realize that there's no chance of reaching a fair deal with the U.S."" for the foreseeable future, said Shi Yinhong, an international-relations professor at Beijing's Renmin University. ""China is not just preparing for a protracted trade war, but also an escalating conflict.""
Both governments have left some room for negotiations. The U.S. wants China to ramp up purchases of agricultural goods. Beijing wants the administration to relax restrictions on transfers of technology to Huawei Technologies Co.
Though those concessions failed to materialize in talks last week, the two sides agreed to a negotiating session in Washington in September. President Trump could put his newest tariffs on hold before the Sept. 1 effective date, and the yuan could strengthen.
""The two countries will fight while negotiating,"" said Guan Tao, a former official with China's foreign-exchange regulator. ""The trade dispute between China and the U.S. will be a long-term and complicated issue.""
In preparing the public for prolonged tensions, Chinese officials and state media have unleashed steady invective against the U.S. in recent weeks, including accusing Washington of stirring protests in Hong Kong. Officials and state news outlets have accused President Trump of violating a truce the two countries reached in June with his threats of additional tariffs.
Mr. Xi hasn't popped up on state media in recent days, fueling speculation that he and other leaders are in China's coastal resort town of Beidaihe, where top officials have gathered most summers to discuss policy and political matters.
The president has faced disquiet within the Communist Party elite, some of whom accuse him of concentrating too much power, making policy missteps, and provoking U.S. and international pushback against China's assertive diplomacy.
""In some ways, Xi has been held hostage by his own image"" as an ardent nationalist and all-powerful decision maker, said Wu Qiang, a Beijing-based political-affairs commentator.

Why Russia and China Are Joining Forces,"Russian and Chinese military aircraft probed South Korean and Japanese air defenses last week, leading the South Koreans to fire more than 300 warning shots before the intruders departed.
This was just the latest manifestation of a deepening alliance between Russia and China. James Dobbins, Howard Shatz and Ali Wyne described the emerging alignment in an April essay in the Diplomat. In 2016, Russia displaced Saudi Arabia as China's largest source of imported oil. In 2017, the two countries held their first joint naval exercise in the Baltic Sea. In June 2018, Xi Jinping called Vladimir Putin ""my best, most intimate friend,"" and later that year Chinese forces participated in the largest military exercise on Russian soil since 1981.
The departing director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, says the two Eurasian supergiants are as close as they were in the 1950s. From Venezuela to Syria to Serbia, they are working to frustrate the West. They are also increasingly cooperating in sub-Saharan Africa and have found ways to reduce their competition in Central Asia.
Many analysts discounted the prospects for deep Sino-Russian coordination. Mr. Putin's overarching foreign policy objective has long been to build up Russia as an independent great power between Europe and China; a close alliance with a rising China works against this goal. Tensions along their lengthy border, commercial rivalries, and Russian suspicion of Chinese designs on its Far Eastern territories tend to drive the two countries apart. Given Russia's slow decline and China's rapid rise, some expected Russia would support Western efforts to balance China rather than undermine them.
Instead Moscow seems to have concluded that the door to the West is closed. The European Union is too weak, too indecisive and too liberal to serve as a strategic partner for Mr. Putin's Russia. President Trump is too mercurial and Congress too hostile for the U.S. to meet Russia's needs. That leaves a stark choice between an alliance with China and isolation.
There is another factor driving Moscow and Beijing together. The circus atmosphere of the Trump presidency sometimes obscures this, but the past few years have witnessed a marked increase in American power. Washington's reach is expanding, its ability to enforce its will on others has grown, and it has become more willing and able to use its power disruptively. Moreover, as recent protests in Moscow and Hong Kong demonstrate, liberal ideas still have the power to challenge the world's autocrats. Russia and China have decided to work together more closely in large part because both countries are more worried about the U.S.
Intelligent people disagree about the wisdom of the Trump administration's Iran policy, and success is far from certain -- but as a demonstration of American power, the economic isolation of a major oil producer in the teeth of stiff European, Chinese and Russian opposition is an extraordinary spectacle. To Russia -- another major oil producer dependent on trade with the West that has felt the bite of American sanctions -- it is terrifying.
Three factors contribute to this surge in American power. First, the success of fracking and related technologies together with the increased use of renewable energy in the West makes world energy markets more resilient. Oil prices are stable and relatively low even though Iran and Venezuela have essentially been forced out of the market.
Second, the growing sophistication of information technology means that U.S. authorities can track complex transactions and enforce secondary sanctions to an unprecedented degree. European governments have been shocked to discover that they cannot protect national companies wishing to do business with Iran from American law. Moscow and Beijing cannot help but notice that these tools could one day be turned against them.
The third factor is Mr. Trump. By using trade and tariffs as weapons in unrelated negotiations, the president has increased America's clout. European efforts to resist U.S. sanctions on Iran, for example, must be carried out in the shadow cast by Mr. Trump's threats to impose massive tariffs on key European products on vaguely defined ""national security"" grounds.
Mr. Trump's critics argue that Washington can't afford to alienate longtime allies as adversaries coalesce against the U.S. They also warn that the institutions that constrained great-power competition are decaying at an accelerating pace. And businesses around the world need the kind of policy predictability that Trump-era diplomacy is steadily eroding.
True enough, and worrying -- but the new world disorder has deeper causes than Mr. Trump. There are two rising great powers in the world today -- not just one -- and the U.S. as well as China is developing a more expansive view of its interests as its power grows.
China has responded to the newly competitive international situation by deepening its relationship with a strategic partner. Combine the jostling ambitions of two rising world powers with the disruptive economic, military and cultural consequences of the information revolution, and the causes of our distemper are easier to understand if not, unfortunately, to resolve.

Tough Conditions Test HSBC's Fill-In CEO,"HSBC Holdings PLC started 2019 with a chief executive poised for growth and focused on making its 238,000 employees the ""best version of themselves."" It is ending the year with a new boss cutting thousands of jobs, culling clients and putting businesses on the block.
The change in approach was triggered by storm clouds in the bank's two most important markets. Violent antigovernment protests have rocked Hong Kong, while the U.K. economy is being tested by uncertainty over its planned exit from the European Union.
The bank, among the world's largest by assets, is also under strain in China, the country it is counting on for profit. It angered some officials by sharing information with U.S. prosecutors about one of its clients, Huawei Technologies Co.
For HSBC's board, the tougher conditions were a wake up-call that it is still too much bank in too many countries. Its response in August was to swap out chief executive John Flint, a 30-year veteran of the bank who improved financial performance but underwhelmed a chairman looking for quicker fixes.
Chairman Mark Tucker -- the first outsider in the post -- asked Noel Quinn, head of commercial banking, to be interim CEO. Mr. Quinn has told colleagues he aims to make the job permanent. Some analysts predict an announcement as soon as December.
The 57-year-old's plan to earn it: Exit low-growth businesses and ax costs to better compete with international rivals such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc.
Mr. Quinn has sped up plans to sell HSBC's large French retail bank and is going deeper with the job reductions that were started this year.
In August, the bank's finance chief said the lender needs to be harder on low-profit customers in Europe and ""reprice them or exit."" Now, thousands of clients in HSBC's global banking and markets business and commercial bank are being reviewed to see if they are worth keeping, people familiar with the matter said.
Analysts anticipate more retail disposals and scaling back in investment-banking activities. HSBC exited around 20 countries and dozens of businesses this decade. But it still has choices to make on allocating capital across its remaining 65 countries.
""'The world's local bank' was a great marketing line but it wasn't a great corporate strategy,"" said Mike Fox, a fund manager at Royal London Asset Management holding shares in the bank.
In private meetings with investors in recent weeks, Mr. Quinn has assured them the bank's heart and soul is still in Asia, its most profitable region, people familiar with his comments said. HSBC makes around one-third of its revenue in Hong Kong, where it began in 1865.
Mr. Quinn said the bank continues to win business from Chinese clients despite the Huawei tensions, a person familiar with his comments said. Data show HSBC worked on several Chinese bond deals last month, including for state-owned banks.
In 2017, HSBC supplied U.S. investigators with details of what Huawei told the bank about its business in Iran, according to court documents and people familiar with the information exchange.
The Justice Department alleges Huawei misled banks about its dealings in Iran. HSBC cut most banking ties with Huawei in 2017, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.
An HSBC executive said some Chinese companies opted not to do business after the bank was attacked in state media. In July, it was left off a new panel setting China loan rates and it is still waiting on a license some rivals received to underwrite corporate bonds in the country.
People familiar with the matter said HSBC has good standing with officials. One said Mr. Tucker was invited to attend China's 70th anniversary parade Oct. 1 in Beijing but couldn't make it.
Mr. Quinn wasn't even in the running in the last CEO search, shortly after Mr. Tucker joined as chairman in 2017. Plain spoken and practical, he has been at the bank since 1987. He initially ran leasing businesses, then went to Hong Kong in 2011 to head commercial banking in Asia and got the job globally in 2015.
External CEO candidates are division heads at banks such as Citigroup, and former and current bank CEOs, according to people briefed on the search.
""Finding an external candidate is very hard. They have to understand the bank, Hong Kong, and Hong Kong and China,"" said Ronit Ghose, an analyst at Citigroup.
Mr. Quinn has said he never expected to be in the job, in part because he didn't fit the usual profile. Most of HSBC's CEOs rose through an elite, career-long ""international managers"" program.
Those include Mr. Flint, 51, who rotated through posts in Asia, the U.S. and Britain on a regimented track to the C-Suite. He was Mr. Tucker's pick for the job in 2017, but their styles clashed almost immediately.
Mr. Tucker, who had just completed a successful run as CEO at insurer AIA Group Ltd., was largely in sync with Mr. Flint on strategy but considered him too ponderous on decisions, according to people who worked with them.
Mr. Flint, in turn, found Mr. Tucker to be imperious and not open to being challenged, according to a person familiar with his thinking.
Mr. Quinn's decision making is ""more instinctive,"" said an executive who served with him on HSBC's senior management team.
His name was one of several on a ""hit by a bus"" list to replace Mr. Flint in unexpected circumstances. He was chosen after Mr. Tucker told Mr. Flint his career at the bank was over at a weekly catch-up meeting in late July at HSBC's private bank in London.
Mr. Flint, asked not to return to his office at HSBC's Canary Wharf headquarters, called in sick for a few days while the bank negotiated the terms of his departure and prepared an announcement, a person familiar with the matter said.
Mr. Quinn ""brings pace, decisiveness and ambition,"" Mr. Tucker said announcing the appointment Aug. 5.

World News: China Asserts Hong Kong Powers --- Beijing says it can unilaterally declare a state of emergency to quell protests in city,"China's top office for Hong Kong affairs said it had legal power to unilaterally declare a state of emergency in the city if unrest continues unabated, while laying out specific measures for the city's leader to address protests.
The comments came amid hints of tensions and disagreements between Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, and her bosses in Beijing over what should be done to try to allay widespread public sentiment against the government in the former British colony.
Beijing made the comments -- in which officials referred to the protest movement becoming more like the revolutions that unseated governments in the Middle East and Eastern Europe -- after a weekend of clashes that disrupted the city's airport. A workers' strike and a boycott of classes by thousands of students have extended demonstrations into the workweek.
Earlier Tuesday, Mrs. Lam had insisted her government can deal with the protests. The chief executive said she had never tendered her resignation and was committed to pulling the city out of the crisis.
Mrs. Lam said she was disappointed that comments she made at a closed-door meeting with businesspeople -- in which she lamented the difficulties of serving both the central government and the people of Hong Kong -- had been leaked.
Beijing officials said they saw the situation in Hong Kong as taking a positive turn recently as more parts of society denounce violence and reiterated their backing for Mrs. Lam to resolve the protests, which have rocked the city and damaged its economy during the past three months.
Beijing made clear on Tuesday it is laying the groundwork to step in if needed. Chinese officials floated a slate of detailed measures for a crackdown, including raising the idea of outlawing masks for Hong Kong protesters and saying teachers who encouraged students to protest must be punished.
Patriotic education must be introduced into Hong Kong schools, said Xu Luying, a spokeswoman for the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office. An effort to introduce patriotic education in 2012 triggered mass street protests that galvanized a new generation of activists who are prominent in this summer's uprising.
The comments from the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council were the first time officials had mentioned unilateral intervention and raise questions about how much autonomy Hong Kong's government has.
""Hong Kong's Basic Law allows for Hong Kong to request help or for the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to declare a state of emergency,"" Ms. Xu said.
Victor Gao, an interpreter for former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, said the latter stipulation of the Basic Law means Beijing can intervene unilaterally without Mrs. Lam's request, but that they are still giving her a chance first.
Mr. Gao, who is no longer serving in government, said he believed that if Beijing intervenes, it will be with police officers or other methods, not with the People's Liberation Army.
In a sign of Beijing's concerns over the optics of cracking down on students, Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, harshly criticized ""separatists"" on Tuesday for turning teenagers into ""foot soldiers and pawns"" in Hong Kong.
Earlier Tuesday, Mrs. Lam renewed her commitment to staying in her position after Reuters reported a day earlier that she had told a meeting of business leaders that her role in the continuing unrest was unforgivable and that she would quit if she had the choice.
The city is entering a fourth month of social upheaval. Mass protests and, in recent weeks, near daily clashes between hard-core protesters and police have occurred in the city's streets and subway stations.

Fear of New Curbs
Triggered Unrest
Under ""one country, two systems,"" Hong Kong was promised 50 years of no change and more freedoms than mainland Chinese citizens enjoy, until 2047.
The protests this summer were sparked by fear of Beijing's increasing reach, as residents took to the streets to oppose a law that would have allowed local suspects to be tried under the mainland's opaque judicial system. Protesters' demands have since broadened to include greater democracy.

America's Stake in Taiwan,"In Hong Kong, hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets to protest a bill permitting the arbitrary arrest and extradition of citizens to mainland China. Hong Kongers were assured in 1997 that they would enjoy a ""high degree"" of autonomy when the British transferred the colony back to China. That ""high degree"" is dropping lower and lower.
Five hundred miles northeast, in Taipei, the Taiwanese are watching the dispute closely. For them it foreshadows what ""reunification"" with China would look like. And for the U.S., it's a picture of what lies ahead if we leave a strategic democratic ally at the mercy of East Asia's Stalinist giant.
Taiwan -- an island nation 100 miles off China's coast, formally called the Republic of China -- was founded in 1949 by Chinese opponents of the Communist revolution. Its history of peaceful transfers of power between opposing political parties is a standing reproach to China's dictatorship. So is its wealth -- Taiwan's gross domestic product per capita is 250% as large as China's.
China's leaders fear and detest Taiwan, in large measure because it's an American ally. In the event of an attack on Taiwan by a hostile nation (read: China), the U.S. is pledged to aid its ally. Failure to fulfill that pledge would effectively encourage other regional allies such as South Korea and Japan to make accommodations with Beijing. That would be an unmitigated disaster: Control of Taiwan would allow Beijing to menace Japan's southwest islands and the U.S. Marine base on Okinawa, to enforce its wrongful claim to the South China Sea.
In 1979 the Carter administration, furthering Richard Nixon's policy of driving a wedge between Soviet Russia and China, formally recognized the Communist People's Republic. Unfortunately, that meant closing the U.S. Embassy in Taiwan. The U.S. formally endorsed Beijing's slogan, ""one country, two systems,"" declaring democratic Taiwan to be, in effect, a subsidiary of mainland China.
President Carter abandoned the U.S.'s mutual defense treaty with Taiwan and agreed to measures to increase American diplomatic and security engagement with China at Taiwan's expense. He left the Republic of China with a small promise of help, signing the Taiwan Relations Act, which Congress passed -- by a veto-proof majority -- to ensure U.S. military assistance for Taiwan's self-defense.
In the 40 years since that shift, American policy toward Taiwan has remained largely the same. But America's relationship with China has changed radically. The Soviet Union is no more; the Nixon/Carter strategy is largely irrelevant. In recent years, President Xi Jinping has adopted aggressive and militaristic policies. It's time for the U.S. to update its approach to Taiwan.
China is a key U.S. trading partner, but no friend. It rejects U.S. political principles and resents America's role as a guarantor of international security in the Indo-Pacific region and globally. Beijing aims to exclude the U.S. Navy from the international waters of the Western Pacific and to sever American communications with its regional allies. China wants military predominance over the chain of islands that bracket the Asian mainland and stretch from the Aleutians to the Philippines. Taiwan, America's 11th-largest trading partner, is at the center of this chain.
At present, the U.S. truckles to Chinese policy on Taiwan. The U.S. does not allow the four-star admiral who commands the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command to visit Taiwan. It does not permit Taiwan's navy to take part in the U.S.-led annual naval exercise in the Pacific -- although we have twice invited China to participate. Taiwan's top political leaders are forbidden from traveling to Washington. U.S. executive-branch officials refuse to visit the Taiwan delegation's Washington offices.
The list of indignities is much longer, and unworthy of the relationship between two democratic allies. The need to remake U.S. policy toward Taiwan has long been obvious. In military or naval terms, it would be difficult to overstate Taiwan's geographical importance.
Mr. Xi says force is an option for ""reunification"" of Taiwan with China. Yearly he adds to China's already formidable arsenal of missiles aimed at Taiwan. Experts debate when Mr. Xi plans to use force against the island. Will it be in 2049, the 100th anniversary of China's Communist takeover -- or in 2020?
The U.S. is now conducting more-frequent freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea and lengthening the range of its antiship missiles to contest control of the seas. Taiwan is building its own submarines. Japan is acquiring more amphibious capability, essential to defending its southwest islands, a short distance from Taiwan. China's navy must pass through those islands to enter the main body of the Pacific.
Beijing would like to roll up both the northern and southern arcs of the First Island Chain (the chain of archipelagoes nearest the East Asian continental mainland), to cut America's ability to supply its East Asian allies, and to have unchallenged access to the central Pacific -- from which it could put at risk the major U.S. base at Guam, attack Hawaii, and cut America's communications with Australia.
National security adviser John Bolton was right to meet with David Lee, general secretary of Taiwan's National Security Council, late in May. No such meeting had occurred for 40 years. It would be wise to open the way for presidential and senior cabinet members' meetings and visits to each other's capitals. Other overdue changes: joint U.S.-Taiwan military exercises, an operations center allowing coordination of exercises and emergencies, and a substantial upgrade of diplomatic relations. All this would clarify America's commitment to Taiwan, reducing the likelihood of Chinese overreach through miscalculation. A realistic policy review would also allow the Trump administration's sale of more than 60 F-16 tactical fighters to proceed without further delay. They are sorely needed to improve Taiwan's defenses against invasion.
We are living in a new world -- the world of attempted Chinese hegemony -- and U.S. policy makers had better adjust, fast. Ask the people on the streets of Hong Kong.

NBA: The NBA's Timid Brick in China --- A tweet about Hong Kong protests provokes an international incident,"It's hard to think of an organization that's enjoyed a run of attention as unabashedly positive as what the NBA has enjoyed over the past half-decade or so. This is the enlightened league that ""gets it""; that allows its players and coaches to speak freely on matters both sporting and political; that is currently amid a ""player empowerment"" era in which it's the talent on the court, not the chair-bound executives, who are largely determining the future of the game.
Here's the thing about all that positivity: it's pretty much deserved. The NBA has shown it's possible to run a large-scale professional operation -- and grow a fan base -- by putting trust in athletes, as opposed to policing them with draconian policies. The NFL remains the country's most popular sport, but, like a rowdy, rich uncle at Thanksgiving, the NFL is forever stepping in it on political/social issues. The NBA, meanwhile, is seen as the sophisticated eldest child, with an empathetic commissioner in Adam Silver, and worldly stars like LeBron James and Steph Curry.
They're the model. It has to drive the other leagues nuts.
So I'd be willing to bet there's a bit of schadenfreude in rival league offices this week, as now it's the NBA which has stepped in it -- and stepped in it on a global scale.
The intrigue began over the weekend, when the Houston Rockets general manager, Daryl Morey, issued a tweet in support of pro-democracy protesters in China.
""Fight for Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong,"" the image tweeted from Morey's account read.
Morey deleted the tweet within minutes -- but it touched off nothing less than an international incident. According to the Journal's NBA correspondent, Ben Cohen, Chinese sponsors have yanked their support of the Rockets, broadcasters have declared they won't air Rockets games, and the Chinese Basketball Association has pulled its ties with the club.
This is not a small thing. China is an enormously valuable market for the basketball league and its affiliated sponsors; Cohen wrote that half a billion Chinese watched the NBA on streaming platforms last season. The Rockets, once led by Chinese superstar Yao Ming, have been particularly popular there. This week -- in an exhibition event that has been long planned -- the league is sending some of its top teams, including James's Los Angeles Lakers, and the Brooklyn Nets, to China, as Morey's Rockets and the Toronto Raptors play in Japan.
That's right. The circus hasn't even gotten to town, and the circus has already gone sideways.
The NBA is not the first U.S. company to run afoul of China's political sensitivities while attempting to grow its business there, of course. Hong Kong, where street protests have raged for weeks amid a government crackdown, remains a volatile flashpoint.
But the NBA is not supposed to be your average business. Again: it's supposed to be the league that gets it, that isn't timid under pressure. What Morey posted -- no matter the reaction -- is not out of sync with the league's values. Defending the Hong Kong protesters? Come on. It's the definition of free speech.
The league's initial response to the situation was theatrically cautious -- a statement in which it didn't apologize for Morey's tweet, but acknowledged the offense it caused, and underscored its ""great respect for the history and culture of China."" Its comment was far more careful than that of Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta, who undercut his general manager with a tweet saying the GM ""does NOT speak for the Houston Rockets . . . we are NOT a political organization.""
Morey himself has offered a subsequent comment in which he said he did not mean to cause offense, and that he has since ""had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives."" Rockets superstar James Harden, thrust forward as an accidental diplomat, offered this on Monday: ""We apologize. We love China.""
Oof.
Meanwhile, Silver -- who made his reputation with a swift expulsion of Donald Sterling after a racist recording of the former Clippers owner surfaced -- gave an interview Monday in which he defended Morey's right of expression (""These are the values that have been part of this league from its earliest days"") but acknowledged ""dramatic consequences from that tweet.""
""It will take some time to heal some of those issues,"" Silver said.
The league is trying to thread a needle here, protecting its business interests while attempting to stay true to its self-touted principles. That has not gone well, because it seldom does -- such ambitions aren't always aligned, to say the least. China does not appear impressed, and back home, the NBA is getting clobbered for what looks a lot like fealty.
Morey is an intriguing character to be at the middle of this tempest. The Rockets impresario has built a reputation as one of basketball's most innovative bosses -- re-envisioning not only his club, but the way basketball is played. Morey is a heretic in the best sense, a quirky renaissance figure who regularly challenges conventional thinking about his sport and almost everything else.
He's exactly what the NBA is supposed to be all about. This week in China, we'll find out the truth.

Stocks Up on New Trade Optimism,"U.S. stocks climbed after President Trump said China wants to reach a trade agreement, signaling a potential de-escalation in tensions between the world's two largest economies.
Markets have swung wildly over the past few days as traders have struggled to make sense of the direction of U.S.-China trade talks.
Stock futures had initially slid late Sunday after White House officials said Mr. Trump regretted not increasing tariffs on China further. But the market opened higher Monday after Mr. Trump struck a more conciliatory tone, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 269.93 points, or 1.1%, to 25898.83.
The S&P 500 advanced 31.27 points, or 1.1%, to 2878.38, and the Nasdaq Composite added 101.97 points, or 1.3%, to 7853.74.
Some analysts said to view the latest flurry of trade-related comments with skepticism, noting the U.S. and China have at several points suggested they were making progress on an agreement, only to back away. There were also conflicting reports from Beijing about whether officials had made a phone call to the U.S. Sunday, as Mr. Trump had told reporters.
Corporate news drove swings among individual stocks. Bristol-Myers Squibb shares rose $1.53, or 3.3%, to $48.11 after the U.S. pharmaceutical giant moved a step closer to securing regulatory approval for its proposed acquisition of Celgene Corp. Shares of Celgene advanced $3.01, or 3.2%, to $97.00.
Lyft jumped $2.10, or 4.3%, to $51.21 after Guggenheim analysts raised their rating for the stock to ""buy"" from ""neutral.""
Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 slipped less than 0.1%, amid low trading volumes around the region. U.K. exchanges were closed for a holiday.
Asian stocks and global government bond yields fell earlier Monday after late-weekend comments from the U.S. on trade deepened concerns about global growth prospects.
China's Shanghai Composite shed 1.2%.
""We no longer expect a partial resolution before spring 2020"" as part of a base-case scenario, Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, said in a note to clients. ""Of course, as both China and the U.S. remain ready to talk, a positive surprise in the form of a partial resolution of at least some tariff issues remains possible.""
Investors are losing faith in how both sides are approaching the trade war and whether a resolution could be reached soon, said Peter Atwater, a research analyst and adjunct lecturer at William & Mary in Williamsburg, Va.
""Confidence requires perceptions of certainty and control,"" he said. ""Stock investors now have neither.""
At midday Tuesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 was up 1.2%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 0.06%, a day after pro-democracy protests in that city turned violent after nearly two weeks of relative calm.
China's currency weakened to a new multiyear low, weeks after Beijing first allowed it to trade beyond the symbolic level of 7 yuan per dollar. The currency is both a flashpoint in relations with the U.S. and a means for China to make exports more competitive.

"Hong Kong, the Trade Wild Card","As if the U.S.-China trade talks aren't complicated enough, the territory of Hong Kong now looms as a potential deal killer.
Chinese officials are sounding increasingly ominous notes in response to the continuing protests in Hong Kong calling for democratic reform to preserve the freedom China promised for 50 years after 1997. Yang Guang, a spokesman for China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said Tuesday that ""those who play with fire will perish by it"" and warned that China has ""tremendous power"" to put down the protests.
That power includes a People's Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong. Chief Executive Carrie Lam said Monday that Hong Kong is ""on the verge of a very dangerous situation"" and vowed to restore order. Mr. Yang echoed those words nearly verbatim.
The fault here all rests with Ms. Lam and her Beijing backers. Her attempt to ram through a new law allowing extradition to mainland China triggered the protests. She says the law is ""dead"" but has refused to withdraw it. She also refuses to allow an investigation into the violent tactics of police and China-backed gangs against protesters.
China has frustrated demands for democracy by ruling out many pro-democracy candidates and ensuring that its factotums run the Hong Kong government. Hong Kongers are protesting in the streets because they have no other way to defend their freedoms.
The risk for stability is if Chinese President Xi Jinping decides to send in troops to squash the protests. This would surely lead to violent clashes, and perhaps bloodshed. Such an invasion would damage Hong Kong as an entrepot for free trade and finance. But Mr. Xi may see it as less risky than allowing the protests to continue as a democratic example for the mainland.
In this context it's a shame that President Trump last week gave Mr. Xi a pass on Hong Kong. Asked about concern that China's army may intervene, Mr. Trump said:
""Well, something is probably happening with Hong Kong because when you look at, you know, what's going on, they've had riots for a long period of time. And I don't know what China's attitude is. Somebody said that at some point they're going to want to stop that. But that's between Hong Kong and that's between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China. They'll have to deal with that themselves. They don't need advice.""
But Mr. Xi does need advice not to invade Hong Kong if he wants a trade deal. Hong Kong is not solely a Chinese matter. The future of the territory is an international issue because China promised ""one country, two systems"" in a treaty with Britain. That special status is the basis for a U.S. law that gives Hong Kong trade and visa privileges not provided to China.
Mr. Trump may think that by giving Mr. Xi a pass on Hong Kong he is helping the chances of a trade deal, but he's wrong about that too. If the PLA does march on Hong Kong, and if there are mass arrests and killings, Democrats will use Mr. Trump's words to claim that he invited the Chinese crackdown.
He would also face overwhelming bipartisan opposition in Congress to a trade deal. And he might face pressure to impose tougher tariffs on China than those he's already imposed. If he wants a trade deal, he'll tell Mr. Xi to keep Chinese troops out of Hong Kong."
Apple Pulls App Flagged By China,"Apple Inc. removed from its app store an app that citizens and protesters in Hong Kong used to track police activity, thrusting the tech company deeper into the furor engulfing U.S. companies as tensions escalate between Hong Kong and China.
The removal, which Apple announced late Wednesday, followed criticism in Chinese state media of the tech giant's decision just days earlier to approve the app, which is called HKmap.live.
Apple said it pulled HKmap.live because of concerns it endangered law enforcement and residents.
It said that the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau verified the app was being ""used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement.""
""This app violates our guidelines and local laws,"" Apple said.
The app's developer confirmed the removal on its Twitter account without elaborating. The developer didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Apple is among the most recognizable U.S. brands in China, and it relies heavily on the country for manufacturing and sales.
Critics had said HKmap.live -- which denotes the presence of police with an emoji of a dog, a widely used insult for police officers during the protests -- will help protesters commit crimes and evade arrest.
The People's Daily, a Communist Party mouthpiece, had condemned Apple and its ""toxic software"" that betrays the feelings of Chinese people.
Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has an agreement to supply news through Apple services.
""I don't think the application is illegal in Hong Kong,"" the app's developer said in an earlier interview.
The developer, who declined to give his or her name, citing safety concerns, said the app merely consolidates information that is publicly available, for example, on Telegram, an app that protesters have been using to communicate.

Business & Technology: TikTok To Review Content Moderation,"WASHINGTON -- Video-sharing platform TikTok, under fire for allegedly censoring content to appease China, has hired two former U.S. lawmakers as part of a team to review its content-moderation policy, the company said Tuesday.
The company's hiring of the K&L Gates LLP law firm, announced in a blog post, could prompt executives in charge at the video-sharing app's headquarters to revise the company's policy.
The law firm will pull together outside experts to review TikTok's content moderation policies on topics including child safety, hate speech, misinformation and bullying, according to the post.
The advisory team includes former Rep. Bart Gordon, a Democrat from Tennessee, and former Republican Congressman Jeff Denham of California.
""We will continue to provide updates and transparency in the months and years ahead,"" said TikTok U.S. General Manager Vanessa Pappas in the post.
Last week, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) called for a national-security review of the 2017 deal that enabled TikTok's Chinese owner -- Beijing ByteDance Technology Co. -- to buy the TikTok platform and expand its U.S. reach.
In his letter to the Treasury Department, Sen. Rubio cited ""growing evidence"" that TikTok's platform is censoring content as Beijing leaders have fought to limit criticism of Hong Kong protests, its treatment of Muslim minorities in northwest China and other moves.
Tuesday's post by Ms. Pappas didn't address Sen. Rubio's criticism. A TikTok representative last week said its content moderation policies aren't influenced by any foreign government and that the Chinese government hasn't requested that TikTok censor content.

Politics & Ideas: 'America First' Needs Democracy Abroad,"Last week a bipartisan, bicameral quartet of legislators sent a letter to President Trump on the situation in Hong Kong. The signatories, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, urged the president to issue a strong statement condemning what they termed ""Beijing's efforts to undermine Hong Kong's autonomy."" They deplored Chinese suggestions that the People's Liberation Army might have grounds to intervene against peaceful protesters. Declaring that ""Hong Kong's governance is not China's internal affair,"" they argued that U.S. failure to respond to Chinese threats would ""only encourage Chinese leaders to act with impunity.""
That same day, as if in response, Mr. Trump described the protests against a bill that would allow extradition to the mainland as ""riots"" (a crime punishable in Hong Kong with a heavy jail sentence) and said the Chinese would have to ""deal with that themselves."" The Financial Times reports that last month Mr. Trump told President Xi Jinping that the U.S. would mute its criticism of Beijing's policy toward Hong Kong to help restart stalled trade talks.
Leaders must make choices, of course. Unfortunately, Mr. Trump has consistently chosen to hush America's voice in the face of actions by other nations that undermine democracy, human rights and the rule of law. He seems to believe that what governments do within their own borders is their own business, immune from external interference or even criticism -- unless a foreign government opposes the U.S. or acts in a way that affronts his political supporters.
This approach repudiates what has been a central tenet of American foreign policy since World War II, which spelled the end of an earlier version of ""America First."" Presidents beginning with Franklin D. Roosevelt understood that the rise of illiberal, undemocratic forces in Europe and Asia threatened the survival of democracy in the U.S. Promoting democracy and human rights was not the obsession of global do-gooders; it was vital to America's national interest.
Over time, solid evidence bolstered this view. Political scientists found that democracies were less likely to go to war with one another than with undemocratic regimes and more likely to cooperate with one another for mutual benefit.
Throughout the postwar era, presidents of both political parties, liberals and conservatives, espoused the cause of democracy -- until President Trump. ""I honor the right of every nation in this room to pursue its own customs, beliefs, and tradition,"" he told delegates to the United Nations last September. ""The United States will not tell you how to live, or work or worship. We ask only that you honor our sovereignty in return."" Even if your national traditions include autocracy or the oppression of women and minorities, he implied, they are none of our business.
To be sure, this pronouncement occurred against the backdrop of public disillusionment with post-9/11 efforts to promote democracy and human rights by force of arms. Nation-building in Afghanistan proved to be a daunting, even Sisyphean task, and both political parties came to see the war in Iraq as a costly blunder. Although President George W. Bush insisted that his administration's grand strategy -- supporting the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ""ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world"" -- was not primarily a military task, it was interpreted as justifying endless interventions in the affairs of other nations.
But rejecting the grandiose Bush doctrine should not mean embracing Mr. Trump's doctrine of moral indifference. Americans should acknowledge, as Mr. Bush insisted, that the health of democracy in the U.S. is linked to the fate of democracy in other countries. We can support democratic movements abroad against autocrats and the rights of minorities over the tyranny of majorities.
Yes, during the Cold War the U.S. was inconsistent in its support of democracy, as left-wing critics have charged. In the name of fighting communism, Washington sometimes supported thugs against legitimate leaders. But on balance, the world is far more democratic today than it would have been if America had withdrawn behind its borders, as it did after World War I.
If elected president, Joe Biden has promised during his first year in office to organize and host a global ""summit of democracy,"" bringing together elected officials, civil-society organizations and the private sector to strengthen democratic institutions and confront the challenge of nations that are sliding back toward autocracy. This would begin a welcome return to the role of global democratic leadership the U.S. never should have abandoned. Meanwhile, is it too much to hope that President Trump will muster the will to defend the rights of self-government that Beijing promised the people of Hong Kong 35 years ago in a legally binding treaty?

Hong Kong Protesters Cast Anger At Police,"HONG KONG -- Public anger at Hong Kong's police force has become a driving force behind a protest movement that is increasingly marked by violent confrontations, after beginning as peaceful opposition to Beijing's growing influence over the city's affairs.
That fury was on full display after police shot a 21-year-old protester at close range on Monday, marking the third such incident during this year's unrest and triggering more clashes throughout the day. The man, identified by friends as Patrick Chow, a hotel-management student, remained in critical condition after undergoing emergency surgery.
Video footage showed an officer drawing a pistol with one hand while holding a protester with another. As another protester, who friends say was Mr. Chow, approached the officer and reached toward the pistol, the officer fired three times, striking Mr. Chow once in the stomach. Police said the officer acted in self-defense to stop the protester from grabbing his gun.
Trust in Hong Kong's police force has plunged since police first used tear gas against protesters in June, polls show, and officers now routinely use tear gas, rubber bullets, batons and water-cannon blasts while trying to disperse and arrest protesters. Police tactics have shifted as some protesters have become more radical and confrontational, with black-clad youths flinging Molotov cocktails and bricks and at times attacking people suspected of sympathizing with Beijing.
The police force has repeatedly said it uses the minimum force necessary to maintain order and has condemned what it sees as increasingly violent actions by protesters.On Monday, police officials showed footage of a 57-year-old man being set ablaze in an attack they blamed on protesters. The man, whom local media identified as Leung Chi-cheung, was reportedly in critical condition.
""If there is still any wishful thinking that by escalating violence the government will yield to pressure to satisfy the so-called political demands, I am making the statement clear and loud here, that will not happen,"" Hong Kong's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, said Monday.
Mrs. Lam reiterated that a probe by the existing Independent Police Complaints Council must run its course before any other investigations can be considered. The council is due to issue an initial report in the next few weeks.
Participants in the protest movement have demanded a judge-led independent investigation into allegations of excessive force and brutality. Critics said the council lacks resources and powers such as summoning witnesses. Those concerns were shared in recent days by an international panel of experts called in by the government to advise the council on its investigation.
With the government refusing to establish an independent inquiry, public anger has risen as police have drawn weapons during skirmishes with demonstrators, shooting three protesters in recent weeks. Tensions rose in recent days after a university student died of injuries sustained during a fall at a parking garage while officers nearby were dispersing protesters.
Anger was visible Monday at a dense community of apartment towers near the parking garage, which has become a makeshift memorial for the student. On Monday morning, dozens of young protesters milled around outside the parking garage with bricks in their hands, expecting police to show up. Others gathered inside around the memorial.
""We think the police just want to kill us all,"" said an 18-year-old university student standing over the shrine. When police arrived outside, she pulled on a black sweatshirt and ran toward the developing front line.
Police fired tear gas in several directions, including into the garage. Protesters scattered into apartment towers. The tear gas wafted into residences, a primary school and secondary school, and a shopping arcade.
Local residents poured into the streets. Police attempted to enter the courtyards of apartments where protesters had fled, but were shouted back by the crowd. Outnumbered, the police retreated, sometimes leveling shotguns at the crowd.
Hong Kong's police force was previously largely respected by citizens. But the force had limited exposure to dealing with violent disruptions until this summer and has been stretched thin from monthslong protests that take place several times a week.
Recent polls show that the police have lost the support of the majority of people in Hong Kong. An October survey by the Chinese University of Hong Kong showed more than half of the 751 people interviewed had zero trust in the city's police force, a sharp rise from 6.5% at the start of the summer.
Amnesty International called for an investigation into the police's actions on Monday. ""These are not policing measures -- these are officers out of control with a mind-set of retaliation,"" said Man-Kei Tam, director of Amnesty International Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong police spokesman dismissed the claim. ""We are under great pressure. Our officers also encountered difficult times during the operations,"" he said, adding that police have guidelines to use force as responsive measures.
More than 250 officers have been injured since June, police said in late September.
Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing lawmaker and adviser to Mrs. Lam, said the priority of the Hong Kong police must be to quash unrest and restore order. ""Police are not there to win a popularity contest. Their job is to enforce the law and maintain order,"" she said.
Earlier this month, the chairman of the Junior Police Officers' Association, Lam Chi-wai, wrote an open letter to the group's 25,000 members condemning what he called ""crazed targeted attacks"" and ""smears"" against the police. He praised fellow officers for ""overcoming countless difficulties and performing duties professionally and in accordance with the law.""

The conglomerate will be pulling the plug on new pension benefits for certain workers. GE said Monday it was freezing its pension plan for 20,000 U.S. employees as of the start of 2021 and offering pension buyouts to 100,000 former employees. The company has been looking for ways to pare its debts as profits evaporated. It is one of the rare big U.S. manufacturers that still allows salaried workers to accrue traditional pension payments but like many U.S. companies it is phasing out that guaranteed retirement. It closed its plan to new participants in 2012. Shares fell 3.3% Tuesday.

Can a new CEO replicate Target's success at Bed Bath & Beyond? The housewares chain is making that bet with the announcement of Mark Tritton, Target's head of merchandising, as its new boss starting in early November. Bed Bath & Beyond has been struggling to adapt to the changing retail environment and looking for a CEO since earlier this year. Some analysts called Mr. Tritton an ideal choice while others wondered whether the hire would be enough to turn the company around. He will take over ahead of the critical holiday shopping season. Shares surged 22% Thursday.
CATERPILLAR INC.
CAT +4.7%
Caterpillar towed industrials companies higher Friday, lifted by positive signs on trade talks with China. Late in the day's session, President Trump said the U.S. had ""come to a very substantial phase one deal."" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also said the U.S. won't be implementing an increase in tariffs on Chinese products that was set to go into effect next week. The optimism on trade helped reverse some losses from earlier in the week. Caterpillar, which has been a bellwether stock for trade, added 4.7% Friday.

The Lament of Carrie Lam,"Protests continued for a 13th straight weekend in Hong Kong, defying the city government's refusal to issue a permit. Meanwhile, signs of a divergence between the city government and Beijing are emerging that could raise the stakes for everyone.
Reuters reported Friday that Carrie Lam, the Hong Kong chief executive hand-picked by Beijing, had considered agreeing to some of the demands of protesters. In particular, she wanted to formally withdraw the proposed extradition bill that ignited mass protests in June. But Reuters reports that Beijing refused to allow the concession.
Then on Monday Reuters delivered another scoop, this time an audio recording of a closed-door conversation last week between Ms. Lam and Hong Kong business leaders. ""For a chief executive to have caused this huge havoc to Hong Kong is unforgivable,"" Ms. Lam says in the video that Reuters says is an excerpt of a 24-minute recording. She adds that ""If I have a choice, the first thing is to quit, having made a deep apology.""
Ms. Lam then implies that she doesn't have a choice because Hong Kong's crisis has risen ""to a national level,"" a clear reference to officials in Beijing, and ""to a sort of sovereignty and security level, let alone in the midst of this sort of unprecedented tension between the two big economies in the world.""
Therefore, Ms. Lam continues, ""the political room for the chief executive who, unfortunately, has to serve two masters by constitution, that is the central people's government and the people of Hong Kong, that political room for maneuvering is very, very, very limited.""
A spokesman for Ms. Lam told Reuters she attended two events last week that were private and declined to comment on the audio recording. But he didn't deny the contents of the tape, and Ms. Lam's analysis sounds realistic. Now that Hong Kong's protests are getting global media attention, Communist Party leaders in Beijing will be highly reluctant to let her concede anything lest they look weak and set a precedent that might encourage protests in mainland China.
Ms. Lam also says on the tape that Chinese leaders have ""absolutely no plan"" to send the People's Liberation Army into Hong Kong because ""they know that the price would be too huge to pay."" But Beijing's official media continue to issue almost daily threats, including one Monday that ""the end is coming for those attempting to disrupt Hong Kong.""
There's also no sign that Hong Kong's freedom fighters are about to give up, despite the arrest last week of pro-democracy lawmakers and activists. Thousands tried to shut down the Hong Kong airport on Sunday, and thousands of students boycotted the first day of school on Monday.
All of which suggests an honorable path for Ms. Lam if she is sincere in apologizing for causing such ""havoc."" If as chief executive she truly has no room to compromise with protesters, then she should publicly admit her functionary status, resign as chief executive, and tell Beijing to stop violating its promise of one country, two systems for Hong Kong.
If she and other Hong Kong leaders join the protesters in showing a united front to Beijing, they might cause China to rethink the costs of its current crackdown and refusal to compromise. Resigning now is the only way she can avoid going down in history as the woman who sold out Hong Kong."
World News: Starbucks Cafes Are Targeted by Activists In City,"At a recent rally in Hong Kong, protesters smashed the glass front of a Starbucks cafe, dragged some of its chairs into the street and lounged around in them as they watched the demonstration unfold.
It was a targeted attack. Another Starbucks in a nearby shopping complex in the same outlying neighborhood of Tuen Mun was boarded up, its windows shattered. Stores around the two cafes were untouched.
The Seattle coffee chain has become a flashpoint for antigovernment activists in Hong Kong. The problem is with the company's local franchisee, Maxim's Group, a Hong Kong-based food and beverage conglomerate that protesters say is an apologist for Beijing.
Across the city, Starbucks Corp. cafes have been spray painted with profanity and plastered over with posters. Protesters have called for a boycott.
Amid antigovernment protests Friday night, a fire burned inside a Starbucks in the neighborhood of Wan Chai. The cafe's front doors had been shattered, and its fire alarm clanged as sprinklers popped on. Protesters gathered outside to watch.
At the University of Hong Kong, a large poster spoofing the chain's logo by turning it red and proclaiming ""Communists Coffee"" was set in front of the entrance Friday to discourage people from going in.
""We don't hate Starbucks, we hate Maxim's,"" said Chris Chan, who in mid-September created a petition on Change.org demanding Starbucks withdraw the Hong Kong company's right to operate its franchise. The online petition has so far drawn more than 54,000 signatories.
Starbucks declined to comment on the situation.
Maxim's got in trouble for comments made by its founder's eldest daughter, 71-year-old Annie Wu Suk-ching, and another prominent Hong Konger in a speech at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.
The offending remarks: that protesters don't represent the city, and that the police have been justified in using rubber bullets and tear gas to control the crowds.
Maxim's has said the founder's daughter isn't an employee and hopes all parties will resolve their differences so the city can get back to normal. It wouldn't comment further.
The protesters' reaction highlights the risk companies face of falling on the wrong side of Hong Kong's sharpening political divide.
Executives across the city are bracing for the worst if one of their employees, managers or owners expresses an opinion that manages to offend either side.
Companies can also face retribution if they seem insufficiently supportive of Beijing's interests. Hong Kong's flagship airline, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., replaced its CEO and chairman and fired dozens of employees after some staffers took part in protests and China reacted by threatening to bar access to its airspace.
Starbucks has supported liberal causes in the U.S., making it an unlikely target. There are about 200 Starbucks locations in Hong Kong and neighboring Macau.
All Starbucks outlets in Hong Kong are operated by Maxim's, which has had a relationship with Starbucks for 19 years and operates the chain's franchise in parts of Southeast Asia. Starbucks owns its 4,000 cafes in mainland China.
While Maxim's operates many other restaurant chains and bakeries in Hong Kong and is the local franchisee for American brands Shake Shack Inc. and Cheesecake Factory Inc., Starbucks has been a more prominent target.

Senator Seeks Security Review of Deal by TikTok Owner,"WASHINGTON -- U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) is calling for a national-security review of the 2017 deal that enabled the Chinese owner of video-sharing app TikTok to expand its reach in the U.S., saying the platform's moderators are censoring content to appease Beijing.
In a letter Wednesday to the Treasury Department, Mr. Rubio called for an investigation into the purchase of video-sharing app Musical.ly by Beijing Bytedance Technology Co., which owns TikTok, the hugely popular platform for sharing short videos.
Shanghai-based startup Musical.ly, which had an office in Santa Monica, Calif., built a strong U.S. user base, with 60 million monthly active users globally at the time of the deal. After the acquisition, the Musical.ly platform, which allowed users to share video selfies with a musical soundtrack, was abandoned in favor of TikTok.
In the letter, Mr. Rubio cited ""growing evidence"" that TikTok's platform is censoring content as Beijing leaders have fought to limit criticism of Hong Kong protests, its treatment of Muslim minorities in northwest China and other moves.
China, he said, is using social-media apps to ""advance their foreign policy and globally suppress freedom of speech, expression, and other freedoms that we as Americans so deeply cherish.""
""The Chinese government's nefarious efforts to censor information inside free societies around the world cannot be accepted and pose serious long-term challenges to the U.S. and our allies,"" he said in the letter.
Under the leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Beijing has exerted greater control over information in an effort to reassert the Communist Party's influence over its citizens, and censorship has been more strictly imposed on domestic media and social media.
The letter came after a recent report in the Guardian that TikTok directed moderators to actively censor certain videos -- news that came after only a few videos of protests in Hong Kong by democracy advocates circulated via the app.
The Guardian report said that TikTok censors videos about Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence or the religious group Falun Gong.
A TikTok spokesperson said its content moderation policies aren't influenced by any foreign government and that the Chinese government hasn't requested that TikTok censor content.
The Chinese embassy in Washington didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Sen. Rubio's statements or on the Guardian report.
The Treasury Department oversees the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., a panel of federal agencies that reviews deals that involve foreign money to ensure they don't put the country's national security at risk. Last year, federal lawmakers expanded the panel's power, instructing it to more thoroughly scrutinize deals involving critical technology and sensitive personal data.
A Treasury spokesman declined to say whether the deal was reviewed by Cfius or whether officials who would have provided information about the deal were given formal notice that the deal didn't pose a national-security threat. The spokesman said that, by law, the department cannot release that information to the public.
Mr. Rubio, along with a handful of federal lawmakers who sit on both sides of the aisle, has grown tough on China. The intelligence-committee member has pushed for legislation that would block Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co. from buying or selling U.S. patents while urging Commerce Department officials to continue blocking its access to U.S. suppliers after the company was formally blacklisted in May.

Alibaba Seeks $13 Billion in Share Sale,"BEIJING -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s leaders used the code ""Project Orange"" to discuss the company's blockbuster initial public offering in 2014. Now they are close to seeing the fruition of ""Project Tangerine,"" the internal name for their effort to raise roughly $13 billion in a secondary listing in Hong Kong.
The Chinese online retailer said Wednesday that it had applied for the offering on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The move gives the Asian financial hub a vote of confidence after monthslong demonstrations and sometimes-violent clashes between antigovernment protesters and police.
Alibaba said in a U.S. filing that based on Tuesday's closing price for its U.S.-traded stock, it could raise up to $13.38 billion. That figure assumes the banks underwriting the deal exercise an option to buy more shares.
The company said it would determine the deal's price on or around Nov. 20, and trading would start around four business days later, or Nov. 26.
In this filing, and a second document made public in Hong Kong, Alibaba said it would use the proceeds to expand relatively new businesses. The company said it would also use the funds to invest in cloud computing and offline retail.
While Alibaba dominates China's online-retail market, holding about a two-thirds share, its newer initiatives such as cloud computing and entertainment are bleeding money amid competition.
In a note outlining the terms of the deal, one of the banks said the deal had launched and Alibaba would take orders for the shares, as well as running a roadshow for prospective investors, until Nov. 19. Alibaba will use the stock ticker 9988, the term sheet showed.
Alibaba is China's most valuable company by market capitalization, worth nearly half a trillion dollars.
The company reported a 40% rise in quarterly sales earlier this month and on Monday set another record for its annual Nov. 11 ""Singles Day,"" selling $38.3 billion in goods.
China International Capital Corp., the Chinese investment bank known as CICC, and Credit Suisse Group AG are the most senior financial advisers on the deal, a role known in Hong Kong as joint sponsors. They are working alongside Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners, the U.S. filing showed.
Alibaba in August postponed plans for its Hong Kong listing because of the city's political instability and poor market conditions. While protests continue to roil Hong Kong, the company was eager to go ahead with the offering because the market conditions did improve, one person familiar with the plans said.
Alibaba's leaders were drawn to Hong Kong for its secondary listing, believing it would give them a foundation of China-based shareholders who actually see and use the company's products daily, this person added.
The secondary listing would be a consolation prize for Hong Kong, which in 2014 lost out to New York on Alibaba's record-setting $25 billion IPO.

Main Street: China's Million New Dissidents,"It's not easy to turn a million prosperous people into political dissidents. But that's what China might have pulled off in Hong Kong.
Organizers say more than a million people poured into the territory's streets Sunday to march against an amendment to the law being rammed through the legislative council, or LegCo. The amendment would allow extradition to China. Every marcher understands the consequence: China would have the power to go after critics in Hong Kong by having them arrested there and then brought to the mainland for trial and imprisonment.
It is the gravest threat to date to the autonomy promised in the 1984 Joint Declaration, which set out the terms for Hong Kong's return to China from Britain. At its core, this promise was that China would respect the most important guarantee Hong Kong offers investors and citizens alike: You and your money are safe here, because we aren't China.
It shouldn't be surprising that the gravest threat to Hong Kong's autonomy has now provoked the greatest public outcry. To put it in perspective, Sunday's march drew twice as many as the 2003 demonstration that successfully derailed an earlier proposed law on treason, sedition and subversion.
For any protest anywhere, a million marchers would be extraordinary. In Hong Kong, it means 1 out of every 7 people. Yet unlike in 2003, this time the government has reaffirmed it intends to ignore public opinion. In any halfway representative society, Chief Executive Carrie Lam would have to resign. Instead, she insists the measure will move through LegCo on Wednesday as planned.
It's a clarifying moment. China has been moving the goal posts on Hong Kong's freedoms ever since laying its hands on the territory in 1997. Ms. Lam has now shown the world that the interests her government serves aren't Hong Kong's but Beijing's.
Feelings are running high. Sunday's protesters carried signs declaring ""no evil law."" The American Chamber of Commerce warns that ""there are too many uncertainties"" and questions why the extradition amendment ""should be rushed through."" In the Nikkei Asian Review, Jimmy Lai, the pro-democracy chairman of the media company Next Digital, warns it invites corruption: ""Even without actual extradition, any time a Communist Party official wants something from a Hong Kong business leader, the businessman will have to weigh the costs of meeting that demand against the potential of extradition to the mainland.""
Kurt Tong, the U.S. consul general to Hong Kong, has been similarly frank. In a May interview that appears on the consulate's webpage, the American envoy took a dig at the government's reassurances that Hong Kongers had nothing to worry about. ""Fear,"" he said, ""is an interesting emotion because you can tell someone don't be afraid but that's not going to make them not be concerned.""
Meanwhile, an official Chinese newspaper blames ""foreign forces."" That's rich, coming from a regime founded on the most noxious foreign import in Chinese history: Marxism. What Beijing really can't abide is the idea of free Chinese people. And it's especially galling in Hong Kong, where these freedoms are a legacy of British colonialism and its unique marriage of common law and open markets.
Hong Kongers would be happy to leave China alone. All they ask is for China to leave them alone too. But now what do they see? Their own Hong Kong police, in riot gear, using batons and tear gas and pepper spray on protesters.
This may be routine for police in mainland Chinese cities. But it has not been routine in Hong Kong. Little wonder that the University of Hong Kong's most recent annual poll finds 62% of the Hong Kong public agreeing that they ""have a responsibility to instigate the development of democracy in China."" Or that the younger Hong Kong people are, the more pessimistic they are about their city's future.
Finally, there are those pesky one million. Today they are simply protesters exercising their speech rights. But if China's leaders are really concerned about sedition, what they should be having nightmares about is what will happen when those one million Hong Kongers conclude that the only way to secure their own freedom is to work to overthrow the Communist Party regime in Beijing.
A short video put out by the organizers of Sunday's rally suggests Hong Kongers won't go quietly into the night. It features locals -- including the leader of the territory's Catholic church, Cardinal Joseph Zen -- appearing blindfolded, on their knees, or with their wrists in chains. The new law, they say, would make fugitives of them all.
It ends with a little boy, representing the future of Hong Kong, removing his blindfold and saying, ""I will opt to rebel."" If that becomes Hong Kong's takeaway from this extradition fight, China's Xi Jinping will rue the day he insisted on ramming it through.

Global Exchange Deals Prove Hard to Achieve,"London Stock Exchange Group PLC's dismissal of the Hong Kong exchange's $37 billion takeover attempt underscores the challenges global exchanges face trying to complete cross-border deals amid geopolitical upheaval.
Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. made its move in September on its London-based exchange, betting the deal would solidify its role as a gateway for the flow of capital between mainland China and Western markets.
But it came less than two months after the LSE and Chief Executive David Schwimmer agreed to acquire Refinitiv Holdings Ltd. for $14.5 billion, with the intention of becoming a full-fledged financial-data provider.
The LSE board quickly rejected the HKEX approach, arguing the Refinitiv deal made more strategic sense and would more easily pass regulatory muster. The Hong Kong exchange responded Tuesday by pulling its offering, arguing that pursuing the deal didn't make sense without any input from LSE's management.
Typically, the Refinitiv deal would be reason enough for the LSE to look askance at the HKEX bid, as it required an end to that tie-up, which shareholders had supported. LSE shares dropped more than 5% after the HKEX bid was rescinded. Its shares remain up more than 70% for the year, much of that coming since the Refinitiv announcement.
LSE had even more reason to dismiss HKEX's overtures given its previous failed attempts to complete big cross-border deals. In 2011, it tried unsuccessfully to merge with Canada's TMX Group Ltd. In 2017, an attempt to join forces with Deutsche Boerse AG also foundered.
Since then, the challenge of pushing through cross-border deals has risen further amid concerns that some Chinese companies are using acquisitions to gain access to assets ranging from technology to sensitive financial data.
Hong Kong is a semiautonomous city, but China's encroachment has sparked months of protests, heightening investor concerns over China's future influence over the exchange.
""The political situation in Hong Kong, the influence of the Hong Kong authorities over the HKEX board and by extension, the Chinese authorities was difficult,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, which provides investment platforms and stockbroker services.
The Hong Kong exchange's withdrawal didn't surprise analysts. The proposed tie-up would have been ""a very difficult deal to deliver, both because exchange mergers are fraught with complications and because of potential U.S. worries about the ownership of LCH,"" the London exchange's majority-owned clearing unit, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said.
HKEX had signaled its confidence in ultimately winning regulatory approval for the LSE tie-up, saying that it had held discussions ""with a broad set of regulators"" as part of its negotiating effort.
Still, the company would have faced an uphill battle. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and Bank of England worried that China would have access to data moving between the HKEX and LSE, as well as critical market infrastructure, people familiar with the matter said.
By rejecting HKEX's takeover offer, LSE places itself under more pressure to deliver on its promises from the Refinitiv tie-up, which include more than GBP 350 million ($428 million) in annual cost savings.

World News: Injured Student Is 'Bravest Type',"HONG KONG -- The high-school student shot in the chest by police during a street battle on Tuesday is a seasoned protester who is ""never afraid to speak his mind and would put his words into action,"" according to a cousin.
Tsang Chi-kin, 18 years old, became the first protester to be shot with live ammunition on the increasingly perilous front lines of the protest movement that began in Hong Kong in early June.
Witness accounts and videos put Mr. Tsang, wearing a gas mask with a pink filter, among a group of protesters wielding metal bars who fought with police during afternoon demonstrations in the district of Tsuen Wan.
One video shows Mr. Tsang swinging a bar at a police officer, who shoots him at close range with a pistol. Another shows Mr. Tsang lying on the ground talking as blood spilled from the left side of his chest. He shouts his name and asks to be sent to hospital. ""My chest hurts so much,"" he says.
Mr. Tsang is ""the bravest type,"" said his cousin, Thomas Chan, who described Mr. Tsang as the family's leading protester. Mr. Tsang was arrested for assaulting police officers, but hasn't been charged.

World News: U.S. Officials Told to Go Easy On China Over Hong Kong,"WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration offered guidance to officials to maintain a measured response to antigovernment protests in Hong Kong over fears that any public statements favoring demonstrators would derail U.S. efforts to get a trade deal with China.
As hundreds of thousands of protesters began taking to the streets of Hong Kong starting in June, administration officials were working to revive their collapsed trade talks with Beijing. Hong Kong is facing its worst political turmoil since the former British colony was returned to Chinese rule in 1997, with marches drawing massive crowds initially demanding a full withdrawal of a controversial extradition bill.
""It was made clear down the chain that we need to be measured on Hong Kong,"" one administration official said, noting that the guidance came from ""the top"" over concern that fragile talks with China might be jeopardized by any outward show of support for the protests.
Negotiators resumed trade talks Wednesday, with China agreeing to increase its purchases of U.S. agricultural exports, a key demand by Washington. Both sides described the negotiations as constructive and said the next round will be held in September.
The protests weren't the first time the administration moved to ease its stance toward Beijing. In June, Vice President Mike Pence canceled a speech on China ahead of President Trump's planned meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at a G-20 summit. The policy address in part had been expected to touch on human-rights violations by Beijing, and was postponed indefinitely amid ""positive signs"" regarding trade talks with China, according to a senior administration official.
The White House and National Security Council didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
The actions reflect the administration's foreign-policy moves that prioritize Mr. Trump's interest in safeguarding relationships where he sees opportunity for economic or political gain, sometimes going against the will of allies and even lawmakers within his own Republican Party.
Last week, even as North Korea fired two short-range missiles off its east coast, an official from the National Security Council, who was traveling in the region for unrelated meetings, visited the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea to personally deliver photographs promised by Mr. Trump to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un from their recent impromptu meeting, according to another senior administration official.
Following the tests, Mr. Trump told Fox News last week that ""they really haven't tested any missiles, you know, other than smaller ones, which is something lots test.""
During the brief Korean DMZ encounter, a North Korean official informed the American official, who couldn't be identified for security reasons, that talks would begin soon, according to the senior administration official.
Similarly, Mr. Trump is treading softly on the question of sanctions on Turkey after Ankara's recent decision to buy a Russian air-defense system, a move that prompted Washington to withhold sales of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s advanced F-35 stealth jet fighters to the country.

World News: Hong Kong Leader Pledges to Listen,"HONG KONG -- Days before China celebrates 70 years of Communist rule, Hong Kong's leader held a public meeting with citizens to try to defuse tensions after months of antigovernment protests, but signaled little inclination to accede to demonstrators' demands.
In her first public dialogue since the unrest began, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam met inside a cavernous indoor stadium with more than 130 citizens who officials said were randomly drawn from more than 20,000 applicants.
The vast majority of the 30 citizens who spoke at Thursday evening's televised event voiced concerns over what they see as police brutality against protesters and selective law-enforcement biased toward pro-Beijing demonstrators.
Mrs. Lam pledged to listen, while standing firm against calls for an independent inquiry into police tactics.
""Hong Kong has many deep-seated problems,"" she said in concluding the nearly 2 1/2-hour meeting. ""I hope this dialogue will give us a chance to examine these problems.""
Some participants dismissed Mrs. Lam's remarks as empty gestures. ""It's as if Hong Kong is suffering from cancer, and you're trying to heal it by using painkillers -- this is too naive,"" said one woman during the dialogue, which she described as a ""political show.""
Mrs. Lam launched the dialogue strategy earlier this month when she pledged to withdraw an unpopular bill that would have allowed suspects to be extradited to mainland China -- the trigger of Hong Kong's summer of unrest. Opening herself up publicly to criticism could make her a more sympathetic figure, though the move may backfire if Mrs. Lam doesn't ultimately act on citizens' concerns.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of the stadium, many holding placards and shouting slogans that reiterated demands that include greater democratic rights and an independent investigation into alleged police brutality.
""We think the government is holding this dialogue just to put on a show,"" said a 17-year-old student who gave his surname as Poon. ""We came here to make sure our voices are heard.""
Protests have unfolded in Hong Kong for 16 straight weekends since early June, when public anger flared against Mrs. Lam's bid to pass the extradition bill. Her concession to withdraw it -- and appeals to peaceful participants to condemn a hard-core minority that favors violent tactics -- haven't curbed the unrest.
Some lawmakers have criticized Mrs. Lam's efforts as political theater, accusing her of refusing to talk to her critics. The chief executive hasn't agreed to any open dialogue with Hong Kong's pro-democracy lawmakers, said James To, a legislator from Hong Kong's Democratic Party.
The government is under pressure to minimize embarrassment for Beijing around two anniversaries over the coming days: the fifth anniversary of the start of the pro-democracy protests, and China's National Day on Tuesday.
Police tactics were a common theme at Thursday's dialogue. Many speakers demanded tougher action against what they believe to be police abuses of power. Only a handful of speakers voiced support for the government.

"World News: Beijing Presses Hong Kong to Curb Unrest --- Official backs police and chief executive, leaving it to territory to stifle protests","BEIJING -- China's top office for Hong Kong affairs endorsed the territory's leader and the police's handling of violent clashes with protesters, signaling that Beijing is unlikely to yield concessions as it pressures the semiautonomous city to quell the unrest.
Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council, on Monday gave tacit support for the city's authorities to ramp up efforts to resolve the standoff -- making it clear that the onus for ending it remains with Chief Executive Carrie Lam.
""The most important thing at present is to punish violence and uphold the rule of law,"" said Mr. Yang. He declined to directly discuss the possibility of sending mainland troops to the city, an unpalatable option for China.
The Hong Kong protests have become an international embarrassment for China as it wrestles with a slowing economy and a trade conflict with the U.S. Beijing sought Monday again to portray the Hong Kong unrest, now in its eighth straight weekend, as the product of meddling by ""external forces.""
The statements came a day after Hong Kong police and protesters clashed Sunday, this time near the city's financial district. Officers used tear gas, riot shields and nonlethal projectiles to contain thousands of protesters, many wearing black clothes and yellow hard hats.
At least 49 people were arrested, police said, as authorities took more aggressive measures to quell the unrest. Some protesters also experimented with more dangerous tactics, including setting small fires in occupied roadways.
The protests were sparked by a proposed extradition law that would have made it easier for people in Hong Kong to be sent for trial in mainland China. The Hong Kong government last month suspended the proposed law in response to the public outcry -- a move endorsed by Beijing -- in a rare reversal for President Xi Jinping.
It did little to quell protesters' anger over the broader issue of Beijing's encroachments on civil liberties in the city. Their demands now include calls for democratic and electoral reforms and a halt to police violence.
Beijing's immediate options are limited, said Adam Ni, a China researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney. ""Beijing just doesn't have any simple short-term answers to the current impasse,"" he said. ""Heavy-handed responses will likely backfire, but responses that are perceived to be weak may provoke more resistance.""
Beijing on Monday highlighted some of Mrs. Lam's perceived failures.
""We have noted that the special region's government has already done some serious summary and reflection,"" said Xu Luying, a spokeswoman for the affairs office. Ms. Xu cited Mrs. Lam as saying she would ""change the administrative style, and listen to public opinion more openly and inclusively."" The Hong Kong chief executive hasn't publicly held discussions with opposition groups.
China has yet to acknowledge the deep-seated opposition among many in Hong Kong to the mainland's political system, with the official line that those opposed are a minority of radicals. Ms. Xu on Monday cast it as an economic issue, and said Beijing would work to help young people improve their livelihoods.
There are increasing signs of distress from the business community. On Monday, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong joined calls for authorities to formally withdraw the extradition bill and form an independent committee to examine all aspects of the unrest.
The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office news conference was accompanied by a fresh stream of mainland media reports condemning the protester violence. After originally censoring information about the Hong Kong demonstrations, Beijing switched tactics in the past week, using state media to fan public anger against the protests.
Beijing also has escalated its rhetoric, with officials warning last week that some Hong Kong protesters had ""touched the bottom line.""
Policy experts say China is unlikely to deploy troops in Hong Kong, as it would reflect a breakdown in Beijing's 22-year governance system for the city. However, a Defense Ministry spokesman said last week military intervention was an option under Hong Kong's Garrison Law, if requested by the city's government.

EXCHANGE --- Markets News: Equities Survive October Without Any Big Surprises,"In the end, there was no big October surprise for the U.S. stock market.
The S&P 500 rose 2% last month, setting a new high and undermining the month's reputation for havoc.
Though most Octobers pass without incident, the market's biggest crashes -- most notably in 1929 and 1987 -- have occurred in October. October 2008 wasn't a great month, either. That has given it a reputation for wrecking investors' portfolios.
October 2018 was also one of those months. The S&P 500 had its worst pullback in seven years and even bonds got hit hard. November and December weren't any better, and stocks began 2019 in a hole.
This October threatened to do the same. The first few trading days were rough. Investors were spooked by the U.S.-China trade war, the U.K.'s looming exit from the European Union and the impeachment inquiry, along with protests in Hong Kong and strife in the Middle East.
Then earnings season came, and companies beat expectations. The Federal Reserve cut rates for the third time this year, and nothing on the political front was very different. That gave investors an opening.
The biggest reason for the turnaround, though, said Oanda analyst Edward Moya, is that the slowdown driven by the trade war hasn't weighed as heavily on the services sector, and there hasn't been a big strain on credit markets.
Moreover, he said, because there isn't likely going to be a resolution to the trade war soon, the Fed will be locked into an accommodative stance. That should push out recession concerns, he added.
The question for the stock market is how much farther it can run. Earnings may have beaten expectations, but they were still weak, and the fourth quarter is projected to see a contraction in profit growth.

"World News: Hong Kong Leader Seeks Second Chance --- Lam freezes extradition bill, but opponents demand withdrawal, resignation","HONG KONG -- This city's embattled leader signaled that her government is unlikely to resurrect a proposed extradition law, which she suspended on Saturday following mass protests, in an effort to quell the biggest public unrest in 22 years of Chinese rule.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam's carefully chosen remarks stopped short of withdrawing the legislation and were rejected by opposition groups who have demanded the plan be scrapped and Mrs. Lam step down, with some calling for further protests.
Two days after a record number of demonstrators took to the city's streets, the city's top official apologized for her handling of the issue and dividing society. The government won't proceed with the law, which would allow suspects to be sent to China for trial, if public anxieties and fears can't be properly addressed, she said. She said the government would ""accept reality"" if the legislation couldn't be passed by the end of the current term of Hong Kong's legislature in July 2020.
Mrs. Lam's remarks were aimed at easing tensions that have rocked her administration and dragged China's central government into the international spotlight by highlighting rising fears among Hong Kong people that the city's relative autonomy is under threat and rights are being eroded. Many who marched over the past week were first-time protesters, a sign of the depth of anger at the bill and the government's attempt to push it through without adequate scrutiny by lawmakers and a public consultation.
The chief executive's comments represent a de facto withdrawal, but the refusal to use the word ""withdrawal"" shows Mrs. Lam is unwilling to bow to public pressure, said Claudia Mo, convener of the legislature's pro-democracy bloc. ""Her supposedly genuine apology has come too little too late,"" Ms. Mo said.
The Civil Human Rights Front, which organized two mass rallies the past two Sundays, said people wouldn't accept anything less than a withdrawal because they didn't trust Mrs. Lam. Suspension means the bill could be reintroduced at any time before the current legislative term ends in 2020, the group said.
The extradition proposal ignited a series of mass protests including a rally on Sunday that organizers said drew almost two million people to the streets. Seven hours into Sunday's march, Mrs. Lam apologized in a press statement to the people of Hong Kong for mishandling the bill.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd of a protest outside the city's legislature on June 12, which included many students.
Such widespread anger has rejuvenated dissent and unified opposition groups who were divided and demoralized after a failed mass street occupation demanding greater democracy from Beijing in 2014.
""I offer my most sincere apology to all the people of Hong Kong,"" Mrs. Lam said Tuesday. ""As a chief executive I still have more to learn, and to do better to balance diverse interests and listen to people from all walks of life.""
If the government can't address people's fears sufficiently, she said, it wouldn't proceed with the legislation and ""it is very unlikely the bill will make the deadline of the end of that term.""
In recent days, some of Mrs. Lam's advisers have issued comments suggesting Saturday's suspension of the bill meant that in practical terms it had been shelved for the foreseeable future. The suspension didn't allay public concerns however, leading to Sunday's record protest.
""When one million people marched at least we got a suspension, when two million people marched all we got is a sorry,"" said 22-year-old activist Joshua Wong, who was released Monday from serving a prison term for his role in pro-democracy protests. ""How many people does she want to drive to the streets?""
Mr. Wong said there would be more protests before the Group of 20 summit in Japan next week and the July 1 anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to Chinese sovereignty. President Trump might raise the Hong Kong issue with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G-20 meeting, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday.
Asked repeatedly if she would heed demands to step down, Mrs. Lam said she hoped for ""another chance"" and referred several times in her 50-minute appearance to all of the work she wanted to do in the next three years, especially dealing with social and economic issues.

The Weekend Interview with Lam Wing-kee and Daxiong Guo: Does Freedom Have a Future in China?,"Taipei -- Hong Kong bookseller Lam Wing-kee was on his way to visit his girlfriend when the Chinese police arrested him at the border. Panic rose like heartburn as officers seized his belongings and hauled him off in a van. So the sight of a familiar face at the Shenzhen police station flooded him with relief. What happened next terrified him.
This 2015 incident wasn't Mr. Lam's first brush with Chinese authorities. They caught him smuggling forbidden literature into the mainland in 2012 but let him off with a warning to desist. In the earlier incident, Mr. Lam met an amiable young policeman who spoke of his travels in Hong Kong in fluent Cantonese. Three years later at the Shenzhen precinct, Mr. Lam recognized the officer and observed that his manner seemed transformed. ""He already became like a Red Guard,"" Mr. Lam recalls. He ""would bang on the table and scream, say, 'You are antigovernment!'""
Mr. Lam's ordeal had only begun. His interrogators later ""asked why I brought those books,"" he says. ""Actually, I told them, 'It is very simple: to make money.'"" That doesn't tell the whole story. Mr. Lam, 63, is soft-spoken and often grim, but his voice becomes joyous when he says, ""I love reading."" In his early 20s, he devoured the works of Jack London and Ernest Hemingway but had trouble holding down a job. He liked reading better than working.
He solved the problem in 1994 by opening a bookstore. Located in touristy Causeway Bay, it attracted mainland Chinese on holiday as well as Hong Kong residents. Mr. Lam watched as mainlanders snatched up lowbrow fiction imagining the sex lives and scandals of Chinese Communist Party leaders. In Hong Kong, Mr. Lam says, ""we all know these are fake. We don't read them."" But mainlanders craved anything that deviated from the party line. ""I let them read,"" he says. ""Then they will realize there is nothing good about those books, their reading level will increase, and I will recommend some better books.""
Along with bodice-rippers, he sold Tiananmen Square histories and nonfiction accounts of Communist Party power struggles. Some clients sought ancient poems that weren't banned in the mainland but printed exclusively in the simplified Chinese characters the Communists favor. Customers wanted traditional calligraphy, understanding ""the structure of Chinese character matters, the beauty of the character.""
Some of Mr. Lam's mainland clients wanted to keep buying books even after they returned home from vacation, so the bookseller became a smuggler. After his 2012 encounter with authorities, Mr. Lam started shipping the books instead of personally carrying them into the mainland. But his girlfriend lived in Shenzhen, and on Oct. 24, 2015, police picked him up as he went to see her.
At the station, they locked him overnight in a stiff metal ""tiger chair"" with his hands manacled behind his back. They took ""turns screaming and accusing me,"" Mr. Lam says. ""They said, 'You are antigovernment. You divided my country. Your behavior influenced our national security.'"" The next day, they blindfolded Mr. Lam and took him by train to a prison near Ningbo, hundreds of miles from home.
They locked him in a sparse cell, constantly illuminated to make it hard to sleep, and dressed him in a reflective uniform to prevent a nighttime escape. They threatened not to feed him unless he signed a waiver of his right to contact an attorney or his family. ""Don't say I'm brave,"" Mr. Lam says. ""I actually have no guts. I need to cooperate with them"" to survive.
Jailers questioned him for hours each day, asking about his childhood, his family and the bookstore. A month in, they surprised him with detailed data about mainland clients taken from the bookstore's computer. They extracted and videotaped a confession to selling illegal books and subverting state authority.
They dangled the possibility of release, then snatched it away. ""They don't have to torture you physically,"" he says. ""This is more awful. They give you hope and then take away, then threaten you that you will forever be locked in this place, will never be released.""
Evidently Mr. Lam's captors thought they'd achieved his submission. In June 2016 they sent him back to Hong Kong, where they ordered him to dispute his own missing-persons report. They also instructed him to retrieve the bookstore's computer, perhaps in hope of verifying the data they had already acquired, and to bring it back to the mainland. Instead, he held a news conference in Hong Kong and told the world of his eight-month ordeal. ""It can happen to you, too,"" he warned.
Fearing for his safety, Mr. Lam fled to Taipei in April 2019 after the introduction of the extradition bill that sparked the current crisis in Hong Kong. He urges today's protesters to do the same. Yet Mr. Lam says he would have smuggled books even if he had foreknown his fate. ""This is what I can do,"" he says. ""Of course I can't change anything by myself, but there is a hope if everyone does it. I do first. I don't care about the result.""
The despair Mr. Lam learned in the mainland rubs through as he talks about the political future of China, where ""the country is the most important thing, and the individual is not important at all."" In his view those priorities long predate Mao Zedong and produced ""thousands of years of despotism."" Thus even a collapse of communism wouldn't guarantee a free China: ""If the culture problem isn't fixed, one after one, [governments] are all the same.""
The demand for banned books, like the demand for classical calligraphy, ""means there is a cultural divide that exists,"" Mr. Lam says. He points again to history, noting that in the early 1980s China was increasingly ""open, and being open brings freedom of thought."" The loosening of strictures on thought led to demands for political freedom, but the government answered in 1989 with the slaughter at Tiananmen Square. It has severely restricted the flow of information ever since, especially since Xi Jinping took power.
Contraband ideas slip through, but the government has made their consumption more difficult and dangerous. That's probably enough, Mr. Lam suggests. Suppose ""there are 50 million people against Xi Jinping and communism -- it sounds like a lot, doesn't it?"" But China is a country of 1.39 billion, the Communist Party has nearly 90 million members, and many in the enlightened minority believe ""if you fight back, they would lock you up."" So Mr. Lam predicts China will remain ""a very closed country. I didn't see that there can be freedom and human rights.""

New York -- Daxiong Guo, 43, takes a cheerier view. The mainland native and comic-book artist drew the most iconic of the Hong Kong protest movement's art. Once a purveyor of subversive literature like Mr. Lam, he also spent time in a Chinese prison but reached the opposite conclusions about China's fate: ""I can see the future. It's very good.""
Born in the northern province of Jilin, Mr. Guo was indoctrinated in childhood that the Communist Party ""loved me, that there was only one truth, that communism was the one way."" In his early 20s he went to work as a reporter and artist at a state-run newspaper. That made him aware of how much the government distorts the truth.
In April 1999, thousands of Falun Gong practitioners peacefully assembled in Beijing, catching officials by surprise. Authorities responded by declaring the spiritual practice an ""evil cult"" and arresting adherents. Mr. Guo knew Falun Gong was harmless -- his own mother practiced it and he had read its books. One day he intervened when he saw police roughing up an elderly Falun Gong adherent in the street. They arrested Mr. Guo.
He spent five days in jail before his editor found him and secured his release, but his newspaper career was over. Short on cash and long on time, Mr. Guo began to draw, submitting a collection of sketches called ""Chinese Ghost Stories"" to a 2000 competition in Shanghai. He won. Eventually his work attracted attention beyond China. In 2005 he became the first Chinese artist to win a prize at the prestigious Angouleme International Comics Festival in France, and in 2007 he debuted at San Diego Comic-Con.
His art was growing more individualistic -- and more political. He illustrated a book called ""Nine Commentaries on the Communist Party."" It details the Chinese government's ""propaganda, persecution, famine, massacre, tyranny, and censorship over half a century,"" in the words of its publisher, the Epoch Times, a New York-based newspaper founded by Falun Gong practitioners.
Chinese authorities harassed and followed Mr. Guo for years but didn't arrest him until 2008, before the Summer Olympics in Beijing. His jailers kept him in ""a very small room, very quiet"" and deprived him of sleep. ""You're very, very sleepy,"" he says, but he'd get ""maybe two minutes, maybe five minutes"" before they awakened him. After three months, he posted bail of about $14,000. The authorities froze his bank account and kept him under intense surveillance, but he escaped to Hong Kong with help from friends. He now splits his time between New York and Toronto.
Unlike Mr. Lam, Mr. Guo thinks traditional Chinese culture is compatible with respect for human rights and the rule of law -- and he points to Taiwan and Hong Kong to prove it. He notes it took centuries for Western nations to enshrine these values in their political systems. For China to do the same, he says, it must undergo a cultural ""rebirth.""
Maoism did significant harm to traditional Chinese culture. Mr. Guo says by the time he was born in 1975, ""everyone had the same face, same bicycle"" and even the ""same suit,"" for men and women. But communism didn't offer much by way of spiritual or moral sustenance, and Mr. Guo doesn't think the party's leaders are true believers: ""The truth is, they just believe in money."" The Communist Party derives what legitimacy it has from economic prosperity. Thus its rule is tenuous amid economic challenges, including a trade war. In any case, Mr. Guo says, a value system built on money alone will never satisfy people, because ""human nature is not Darwinian.""
""If you have no culture, you have no future,"" he continues, ""but in culture, you have good culture and bad culture."" Mr. Guo says affluent Chinese born in the 1970s and '80s often recognize the cultural deficiencies of the Communist Party. But he worries about the poor and the young. The aggrieved poor could turn back to Maoism, and young Chinese are easily distracted. When they're not studying or working, they're consumed by videogames and movies. Those stories could help liberate the minds of Chinese youth, but Mr. Guo sees a disheartening confluence between Beijing and much of the Western entertainment industry: ""Hollywood doesn't care about culture, Hollywood cares about money.""
Communist officials are aware that citizens yearn for meaning. They appeal to patriotism and ""try to construct a Chinese model of heroism"" in which protagonists ""will sacrifice their life to save the Chinese nation."" As an alternative, Mr. Guo's art depicts courageous Hong Kong protesters who are willing to sacrifice themselves ""for the freedom of your nation, not for government."" His message: It ""doesn't matter how strong you are, how rich you are, how super normal you are, even if you are very weak, very little."" If ""you are not afraid to stand with justice, you are the hero.""
Protesters in Hong Kong often carry posters bearing his artwork, and he believes it can help overcome Chinese skepticism. ""If you go to mainland Chinese people and say, 'Look what China is doing in Hong Kong,' they'll say, 'I completely disagree,' and blow up into a fight. But if you show them with art, then they'll think about that and it may make a difference in changing their minds.""
""The Chinese government has two weapons -- one is lies, one is violence,"" Mr. Guo says. ""So if you fight with the Chinese government with violence, you will be losers. You must use the truth, and they will be weak.""
He adds: ""Art is a gift that God has given to us to solve problems in a merciful way.""On that at least, he and Mr. Lam ought to be able to agree.

Trump Ousts Bolton After Clashes --- Exit frees President to pursue his instincts to negotiate with the nation's adversaries,"President Trump has rewritten the U.S. foreign policy playbook with his willingness to meet anyone and go anywhere to get a deal. With his hawkish national security adviser John Bolton gone, Mr. Trump has removed one of the last voices of dissent.
So far, Mr. Trump has become the first president to set foot in North Korea and to meet its leader, and has sought to forge close ties to Russia's president. Mr. Bolton's exit could remove a barrier to a meeting at the United Nations with Iran's president later this month, or to talks with members of the insurgent Afghan Taliban movement.
""From the outset, President Trump has had two voices whispering in his ears: the one counseling diplomacy and . . . the other recommending belligerence,"" said Rob Malley, who was an adviser to former President Obama and now heads the International Crisis Group in Washington. ""With Bolton gone, the second voice undeniably has lost its loudest proponent. That could create new opportunities for diplomacy on Iran, Afghanistan, North Korea and Venezuela.""
The formalities and discipline of diplomacy were a tough fit for Mr. Trump from the start. He ran for office as a Republican but has few apparent ties to the party's traditionally conservative philosophy on foreign-policy matters. He often cites his flexibility as a way to reassure people that some of his more unconventional and controversial proposals are subject to change.
Mr. Trump has said he shuns the need for consensus, hailing opposing views among his top advisers as an asset. As one of the last independent foreign policy voices in the administration, Mr. Bolton conveyed an unapologetic, ultra-hawkish but experienced view that frequently contradicted Mr. Trump's boisterous but anti-militaristic approach to foreign policy matters.
Mr. Bolton joined the administration in April 2018, a point at which some of the administration's more moderate figures were already gone. With Mr. Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a fellow hawk, Mr. Trump's foreign policy was expected to take a dramatic turn.
But Mr. Trump has opted for dialogue over conflict. For instance, he shelved plans, supported by Mr. Bolton, for a retaliatory strike after Iran shot down a U.S. drone in June. Asked about his differences with his then-national security adviser on Iran, Mr. Trump told reporters: ""I temper John -- which is pretty amazing.""
Iran's government spokesman, Ali Rabiei, applauded Mr. Bolton's departure in a post on Twitter. ""Months ago, #JohnBolton had promised that #Iran would not be there in 3 months; we are still standing & he is gone. With the ousting of its biggest proponent of war & economic terrorism, the White House will have fewer obstacles to understanding the realities of Iran.""
Mr. Pompeo said Tuesday that Mr. Trump would meet with the Iranian president. ""The president has made very clear he is prepared to meet with no preconditions,"" he said.
Mr. Trump has engaged in trade battles around the world, but opted to maintain a measured response on protests in Hong Kong so not to disrupt his trade talks with China, even as Republican lawmakers offered public support for the demonstrators.
Despite pressure from Mr. Bolton and others, including many Republicans in Congress, Mr. Trump continues to tread softly on the question of sanctions against Turkey after Ankara's recent decision to buy a Russian air-defense system, a move that prompted Washington to withhold sales of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s advanced F-35 stealth jet fighters to the country.
Mr. Bolton's outspoken advocacy for tougher action against Venezuela and Cuba was a source of great tension within the administration. Mr. Trump has become increasingly frustrated that his gamble on regime change in Caracas through economic pressure isn't paying off.
Mr. Trump has drawn criticism for rushing into international negotiations without careful preparation. While Mr. Bolton's departure opens the door to talks with Iran, it could worry key U.S. allies in the Middle East, including Persian Gulf nations and Israel, who believed that the Obama-era of greater accommodation with Iran was over, said Danielle Pletka, of the American Enterprise Institute.
""The bottom line is it means uncertainty,"" Ms. Pletka said of Mr. Bolton's exit. ""Uncertainty in foreign policy, just like in economics, is not a good thing.""
With the departure of Mr. Bolton, the Trump administration also is losing one of its more experienced policy makers. Mr. Bolton's deputy will fill the job until Mr. Trump appoints a new full-time adviser.
The vacancy at the National Security Council, which Mr. Bolton headed, occurs as Mr. Trump is trying to find someone to lead the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which has been vacant since Dan Coats resigned in July. Similarly, the Department of Homeland Security has had an acting director since the resignation of Kirstjen Nielsen in April.
At the Defense Department, Secretary Mark Esper started work in his post after his Senate confirmation in July, months after the resignation of former Secretary Jim Mattis over differences with Mr. Trump.
Mr. Pompeo, a key Trump ally, has been in place since 2018, and before that was director of the Central Intelligence Agency. However, he has been mentioned as a possible candidate for the Senate from Kansas, and key lawmakers were unable to predict whether Mr. Bolton's departure would have an effect on his calculations.
""I would guess on the Pompeo side of the equation is that his role in the administration, or his influence, becomes more important,"" said Sen. Jerry Moran (R., Kan.). ""If you're looking for stability you wouldn't want, in this case, another cabinet member to depart.""
Messrs. Bolton and Pompeo were expected to repair a long -dormant interagency process of decision-making and policy formulation within the executive branch that was plagued by a lack of coordination. But the process has continued to lead to diverging public statements between the White House and agencies, such as when Mr. Trump said talks with the Taliban were dead after Mr. Pompeo said he hoped they resume.
Mr. Bolton opposed the administration's opening to the Taliban.

Hong Kong's Crisis Isn't Over,"Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said Wednesday she'll withdraw legislation that would allow extradition to mainland China. The bill was the catalyst for 13 straight weekends of protest and the concession is welcome, but by now it will take more to end the city's political crisis.
The demands of protesters have escalated as police have arrested more than 1,100 people, including pro-democracy lawmakers and activists. Hong Kongers now want the right to directly elect their chief executive and lawmakers. Beijing won't allow this, but Ms. Lam could at least acknowledge the excessive use of police force and allow an independent inquiry into abuses. Yet on Wednesday she claimed that a probe of police enforcement actions is ""best handled by the existing and well-established Independent Police Complaints Council.""
The council has authority merely to ""observe, monitor and review"" internal police investigations and make recommendations, without the independent power even to summon witnesses. Council members are appointed by Ms. Lam, who answers to Beijing. The council lacks the independence and statutory authority to conduct a credible inquiry.
Police have also repeatedly refused to issue permits for protests, so some of those arrested now face up to five years in prison for peacefully demonstrating without police approval, and hundreds of thousands could face similar charges.
Meanwhile, the Chinese foreign ministry on Tuesday denounced Hong Kong publisher and businessman Jimmy Lai as ""a leading anti-China activist who attempts to mess up Hong Kong."" The same statement attacked activists Joshua Wong and Alex Chow. Mr. Wong was arrested last week on three protest-related charges. A news report says thugs threw a Molotov cocktail near Mr. Lai's residence.
We featured Mr. Lai in our pages in June, and the New York Times recently discovered him. China's denunciation shows Mr. Lai is on Beijing's target list and why Hong Kongers don't trust Ms. Lam's assurances. To restore public confidence in the rule of law, Ms. Lam should urge that charges be dropped against nonviolent protesters."
"Main Street: Apologize, Carrie Lam","Hong Kongers took to the streets again Sunday, some 1.7 million strong. This time it wasn't only to demonstrate their undiminished objection to a bill that would allow extradition to mainland China, which Hong Kong's government has shelved but not entirely killed. Sunday's march was also meant to highlight their commitment to peaceful protest.
In this sense, Sunday's demonstration was an act of humility. A week ago, demonstrations were getting out of hand, and two mainland men at the airport were roughed up by protesters who suspected them of being undercover Chinese or police agents. The day after the airport occupation ended, Reuters carried a photo of penitent airport protesters bearing a sign with these words: ""Dear Tourists: We're deeply sorry about what happened yesterday. We were desperate and we made imperfect decisions. Please accept our apology.""
If the governments in Beijing and Hong Kong would show an ounce of that humility, the protests might be over tomorrow.
Because there's no single authority behind the protests, the demands vary. But the big five are as follows: complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, an independent commission to investigate police behavior, the dropping of criminal charges against arrested protesters, a halt to calling the protests ""riots,"" and full democratic elections.
The government will never meet all these demands. But what people demand and what they will settle for are different things. What Hong Kongers most want from their government (and their sovereign) is some sign of respect.
For all China's alleged might and wisdom, apparently this is beyond reach. Then again, autocrats everywhere have always confused a healthy regard for public opinion with weakness. As a result, they tend to begin by suppressing liberals and end up creating radicals.
That is now Chinese President Xi Jinping's dilemma. With each passing day the costs of a resolution go up as his options shrink.
So what might it take to quiet Hong Kong? At the top of the list would be some public acknowledgment that the acrimony and unrest of the past 11 weeks could have all been avoided. Hong Kong is an example of what happens when an undemocratic and unapologetic government gives its people no outlet but the streets to exercise their opposition to what is being done to them.
In democratic societies, humility is regularly forced onto leaders. Ronald Reagan had to take ""full responsibility"" for a policy he said had unfortunately ""deteriorated"" into ""an arms-for-hostages deal."" Bill Clinton went on television to confess that he'd given the American people a ""false impression"" about his ""inappropriate relationship"" with intern Monica Lewinsky. George W. Bush would admit that ""much of the intelligence"" justifying the invasion of Iraq ""turned out to be wrong.""
The prospects for such a reckoning in Hong Kong aren't good. Public remarks by Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the Hong Kong officials under her, including the police, have been alternately evasive and defensive. In Beijing, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs office accused protesters of exhibiting signs of ""terrorism."" No surprise, then, that Hong Kongers find themselves regarded as hooligans rather than citizens of a successful society desperate to preserve the way of life they were promised they could keep.
Alas, mendacity continues to be the order of the day. At the same time Hong Kongers were showing regret for the violence that marred earlier protests, what was Beijing doing? Releasing intimidating footage of military vehicles mobilizing across the border in Shenzhen, spreading disinformation about the protests on Facebook and Twitter, and pressuring companies from Cathay Pacific to the Big Four accounting firms to fire any employee who supports the protests. And all without a word from Mrs. Lam that threatening Tiananmen-style intervention, using social media to spread false and divisive information and poisoning business decisions with ideology are precisely the imports from China that threaten Hong Kong's standing as a world financial center.
In a column in Next magazine, the veteran newsman Yeung Wai Hong invoked remarks made by Zhu Rongji during a 2002 visit to Hong Kong, just a few months before he stepped down as China's premier. Mr. Xi and Mrs. Lam would do well to consider his words. ""If having returned to the motherland, Hong Kong is run into the ground under our guidance,"" Mr. Zhu asked, ""are we not guilty of crimes against the Chinese people?""
Whether you are a hard old Communist in Beijing or a young demonstrator in Hong Kong, you'd probably both agree that Mrs. Lam has bungled things. Mr. Yeung believes any resolution starts with some public act of official contrition for how terribly Hong Kong has been treated.
Mr. Zhu, 90, is too old to do it. But not Mrs. Lam. She says she loves Hong Kong and that it is in danger of ""falling into the abyss."" If a little humility would keep those Chinese armored personnel carriers from rumbling into Hong Kong, is it really too much to ask?

World News: U.S. Pilot For FedEx Is Detained In China,"HONG KONG -- Chinese authorities have detained a FedEx Corp. pilot in the southern city of Guangzhou, elevating pressure on the express shipping giant that is already in Beijing's crosshairs amid a U.S.-China trade war.
The pilot, a former U.S. Air Force colonel named Todd A. Hohn, was detained a week ago while waiting for a commercial flight to his home in Hong Kong after flying deliveries throughout Asia from the FedEx regional hub in Guangzhou, people familiar with the matter said.
A lawyer for the Hohn family in Niceville, Fla., confirmed that Mr. Hohn had been detained in China. He was a wing commander at the Altus Air Force Base in Oklahoma until 2017.
Reached briefly at his hotel room Thursday, Mr. Hohn identified himself to a reporter and then referred all questions to a family lawyer and discontinued the phone call. He is married and a father, the people familiar with the matter said.
When he was detained, Mr. Hohn was carrying nonmetallic pellets used in low-power replica air guns in a checked bag, the people said. Chinese authorities have alleged that Mr. Hohn was illegally transporting ammunition and have begun a criminal investigation, the people said.
Like many FedEx pilots working in the region, Mr. Hohn commutes to the Guangzhou hub from his home in Hong Kong. Border police have been checking bags of travelers between Hong Kong and the mainland as pro-democracy protests rocking the city have turned increasingly violent.
Mr. Hohn was detained Sept. 12 by Chinese security officials, who escorted him from a preboarding executive lounge, interviewed him and retained his passport, cellphone and other communication devices, the people said.
Mr. Hohn has been told he isn't allowed to leave mainland China until the investigation concludes, the people familiar with the matter said.
""Chinese authorities in Guangzhou detained and later released one of our pilots on bail after an item was found in his luggage prior to a commercial flight,"" FedEx said in a statement to The Wall Street Journal. ""We are working with the appropriate authorities to gain a better understanding of the facts.""
Mr. Hohn was detained as he was waiting to board a flight with Cathay Dragon, a subsidiary of Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. The airline has come under increased scrutiny by Chinese authorities after some of its employees took part in demonstrations in Hong Kong or voiced support online for the opposition movement.
Chinese police at Guangzhou airport said they haven't detained any Americans since Sept 12. The airport Customs Office said it had no record of cases related to ammunition that day. China's airport immigration office declined to comment.
Mr. Hohn's last trip had been unexpectedly extended after he volunteered to take over the flight duties of another FedEx pilot whose wife had gone into labor and who was suddenly called away, one of the people familiar with the matter said.
That tacked on an additional flight from Tokyo's Narita airport. Mr. Hohn had completed that flight and was preparing to travel home when he was detained.
He had cleared security with the air gun pellets, which are often made of plastic, without any issues at both the airport in Japan and an exit-screening at the FedEx facility in Guangzhou, the people familiar with the matter said.

"World News: China Hardens Line on Hong Kong Revolt --- A day after activists break into legislature, Beijing hints it may need to respond","BEIJING -- China's government signaled its fraying patience with protesters in Hong Kong a day after they stormed the city's legislature, calling the violent turn a direct challenge to Beijing's authority and suggesting it would have to be answered.
Public statements from Beijing marked a shift in Chinese leaders' attitude toward the crisis in the semiautonomous territory, indicating they may be forced to step in if events spiral on. They stopped short of suggesting any need for immediate intervention, however.
On Tuesday, the day after protesters smashed their way into the Hong Kong legislature on the 22nd anniversary of the city's return to Chinese rule, officials denounced the demonstrators as extremists seeking to undermine China's sovereignty over the former British colony. State media called the violence an effort to destabilize the global financial and business center.
The Chinese government's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office called the protests a ""blatant challenge to the bottom line of 'one country, two systems'"" -- Beijing's framework for governing the city as a semiautonomous territory.
Beijing professed its continued support for the territory's government to defuse the protest movement, which began in opposition to a proposed law -- now suspended -- that would allow extradition of suspects to the mainland and its opaque court system.
""There's a Chinese saying: Bad things shouldn't happen more than three times,"" said Song Xiaozhuang, a professor at Shenzhen University's Center for Basic Laws of Hong Kong and Macau. ""If Hong Kong authorities aren't able to handle the situation, the central government will take action.""
Until Monday, protesters had largely used nonviolent means to resist what they see as mainland encroachment into their city. Despite the storming of the legislature by some protesters, the third mass demonstration in under a month was mostly peaceful, calling for the full withdrawal of the extradition bill and the resignation of Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam.
Beijing has tried to keep its distance from the crisis, giving local authorities room to maneuver in resolving the tensions while President Xi Jinping grapples with a bruising trade dispute with the U.S. and an economic slowdown.
But for Mrs. Lam to formally withdraw the extradition bill and resign, while assuaging public anger, would be unthinkable for Beijing.
Yet the more directly China intervenes, the more it risks inflaming tensions and undercutting the legal autonomy that underpins Hong Kong's appeal as a financial and business center.
Deploying troops or paramilitary forces would be a last resort in the event the local government is paralyzed and unable to restore order, Chinese political experts said.
""The suspension of the bill is tantamount to a withdrawal,"" said Zhang Jian, an associate research fellow at the Shanghai Institute of International Studies who studies Hong Kong affairs. ""There is no more room for backing down, no more ground for retreating."" The government must take some time to cool down public sentiment, he said.
Beijing has often appeared tolerant of mass protests in mainland China and Hong Kong -- and when passions and attention fade, authorities detain, attack or otherwise punish ringleaders to prevent a recurrence.
Over the past month of protests in Hong Kong, Beijing has sought to contain some of the domestic fallout by blaming radical dissidents and foreign powers, including the U.S., for inciting the unrest, and by managing mainland news coverage of the events. On Monday, the evening newscast on state television focused on celebrations of the anniversary of the city's return to Chinese rule while omitting mention of the concurrent protests.
In Tuesday's shift in tone, Chinese officials and state media openly acknowledged the unrest. Some state news outlets focused on the violence and its aftermath, publishing footage and photos of the vandalized legislative building.

World News: Hong Kong Protesters Defy New Mask Ban --- Government's first use of emergency powers in decades fails to quell violence and vandalism,"HONG KONG -- The government's first use of emergency powers in half a century failed to stop violence and vandalism flaring across the city, leaving officials with the choice of introducing more extreme measures to win back the streets or risking intervention from Beijing.
For the first time in the four months of unrest, uniformed soldiers from the Hong Kong garrison of the People's Liberation Army raised a yellow warning flag at nearby protesters, saying: ""You are in breach of the law. You may be prosecuted.""
Tens of thousands poured into the streets on Sunday, many wearing masks in defiance of a ban on them introduced on Saturday under the emergency law. Some protesters set fires and smashed Chinese banks and subway stations, while police, outnumbered at many locations, fired volleys of tear gas and projectiles. A taxi driver was beaten bloody by a mob in another district after he rammed into a group of protesters.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam invoked the colonial-era law on Friday to ban masks at public gatherings, saying it was necessary to deter protesters who posed a serious danger to Hong Kong. The full emergency law, however, gives her government sweeping powers that include allowing authorities to impose curfews, extend detentions, censor the internet and take control of all transport -- moves her government has been reluctant to impose.
""I would expect to see such power to be invoked soon, if the masks ban does not stop the protests,"" Steve Tsang, director of the School of Oriental and African Studies China Institute at the University of London. ""There is now a sufficiently strongly motivated group among the protesters to fight whatever the government does to end the protests, so I see an escalation.""
If the wider application of those powers fails, Mr. Tsang said, the next step would be the deployment of China's People's Armed Police -- a paramilitary force used across the mainland border for domestic security.
After the worst violence in more than 50 years erupted on Oct. 1 -- the 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China -- Victor Gao, an interpreter for former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, said Beijing's intervention looked increasingly likely.
""It is violence, it is rioting, it is treason,"" said Mr. Gao, who is among Chinese commentators who have advocated a tougher line on Hong Kong. By law, such intervention would require a request from the Hong Kong government or a formal meeting by the central government to declare an emergency situation, Mr. Gao said.
Hong Kong's government said the ban on masks was needed to deter vandalism and other unlawful acts that pose a serious public danger. Those arrested for wearing masks at public gatherings and unlawful assemblies face as much as one year in prison.
The chief executive said on Friday that even though she was using emergency laws, Hong Kong wasn't in a state of emergency. By Saturday, Mrs. Lam was condemning the ""extreme behavior of the rioters"" who turned out to protest the measure late that day. During the mayhem, a 14-year-old boy was shot in the leg on Friday by a police officer out of uniform who was briefly set on fire after being hit by a Molotov cocktail.
Despite Mrs. Lam's plea, little changed on Sunday as an 18th weekend of unrest saw mass rallies that started out peacefully, before some protesters rampaged through several districts and police filled the streets with tear gas to disperse crowds.
Earlier Sunday, Hong Kong's High Court rejected a bid for an injunction to block the ban on face masks.

"World News: Rising Pork Prices Plague China --- Beijing's measures to lift supply, lower costs for consumers fall short, adding to woes","NANNING, China -- Beijing has tried a variety of measures in recent weeks to bump up the pork supply and bring down prices after a yearlong outbreak of African swine fever decimated the country's hogs. So far, they haven't been enough.
Government officials have pushed farming incentives, rationing, campaigns encouraging people to eat more chicken -- even opening its emergency pork reserves.
But rising prices still threaten to mar the celebratory mood ahead of the 70th anniversary of Communist Chinese rule on Oct. 1, adding to a litany of headaches that includes the trade war with the U.S. and protests in Hong Kong.
Government data released on Tuesday showed prices of pork -- a key staple of the Chinese diet -- surging 46.7% in August from the year-earlier month, the biggest such jump in eight years. The leap in pork prices alone was enough to lift the overall headline consumer-inflation figure for the month by more than 1 percentage point to match July's 17-month high.
African swine fever, which is harmless to humans but lethal for hogs, pushed up meat prices across the board by nearly 31% in August as consumers sought alternatives like beef and mutton, government figures show.
The price of pork in China is closely watched by authorities at the Ministry of Commerce, which in August pledged to release frozen pork reserves to keep prices from fluctuating too dramatically.
The southern province of Guangdong, one of China's most prosperous, on Monday said it would release more than 3,000 tons of pork from its reserves ahead of the Mid-Autumn Festival on Friday and the country's 70th birthday.
The fallout is particularly acute in markets around Nanning, the capital of neighboring Guangxi province and traditionally one of the country's leading regions in pork supply and consumption. Here, consumers and producers are struggling with the financial fallout from the outbreak.
In early September, Nanning officials capped prices, lowering them by 10% and handing out pink ration tickets at some local markets -- limiting buyers to 1 kilogram a day, in a move that prompted comparisons to Mao-era China.
After two days, the pink-slip system was abandoned. Even with price cuts across the board, local residents said the meat was still too expensive. Markets selling discounted pork had few customers. Vendors lamented a sales slump they hadn't seen in decades of doing business.
He Jie, a 30-year-old father of two, said he was unable to get a ticket after standing in line on the first day. Two days later, he bought a handful of ribs at the same marketplace during a quiet lunch hour, to make into soup for his wife and nursing infant. ""I can't imagine life without pork. But our income is not growing and prices are rising,"" he said.
With few signs of a price reversal, authorities hope citizens will learn to cope. In recent days, state media have begun building a case for not eating pork.
In the latest sign of the distress among policy makers, China's cabinet on Tuesday urged local officials to step up their efforts to stabilize pork prices, ordering them to ""ensure efficient supply of pork during major holidays"" and requiring them to submit progress reports by the end of the year.
""There's a significant reversal in the direction of policy,"" said Zhang Wendong, an assistant economics professor at Iowa State University and co-founder of the school's China Ag Center. ""I think the Chinese government originally underestimated the potential magnitude of this outbreak.""
The Nanning Daily, an official newspaper, quoted the city's economic-planning agency acknowledging the impact of high pork prices, saying they had severely affected the lives of locals. Nanning officials didn't reply to requests to comment.
In the longer run, some analysts said, one of the government's biggest hurdles will be persuading farmers to raise more pigs after more than a year of combating the disease. Without a viable vaccine for African swine fever, the threat of another outbreak has discouraged farmers from expanding or restoring production.
The possibility of infection compelled Luo Hengfeng, 63, to rush his hogs to market at a 40% discount, despite the fact, he said, that none of them had fallen ill. Two months ago, the farmer bought about 5,000 chickens that now roam freely around the empty concrete pig pens. Out of a herd of hogs that once numbered more than 500, Mr. Luo now has just two -- piglets he has kept to see whether or not they're capable of surviving. So far, Mr. Luo said, they seem to be healthy.
""If there are vaccines, I'd like to keep raising pigs until I'm 70,"" he said.

The NBA Can Beat China,"If the National Basketball Association's product is any good, and it is, the league should not worry about the sudden furor with its Chinese fans. Some controversies need to be quelled and some just need to be allowed to blow over. This is the latter.
Prompting the blowup was a tweet from a modestly-known executive of the Houston Rockets supporting Hong Kong protesters. Almost randomly do such supernovas emerge from one or two of the 200 billion tweets issued every year. It pays not to overreact. China will not win this battle unless the NBA goes out of its way to let it. The world's best players will not stop coming to the world's premier stage, whereas China can only cut itself off from the most culturally regnant basketball played anywhere on the planet. There's no prospect, now or possibly ever, of China developing a competing product.
I would rather be playing the NBA's hand than Beijing's in the current dust-up. The NBA has tried both to grovel and stand up for free speech, trending toward the latter since league president Adam Silver entered the fray. Here's guessing that if the offending tweet had been sent by LeBron James or Steph Curry, the league would have been even quicker to figure out which side it's on (also doubtful is that the Chinese government would be relishing the fight quite so much).
On the flip side, what Hong Kongers are fighting is often antiseptically described as an ""erosion of their rights."" It would be better likened to a Beijing-sponsored attempt to rip out their indoor plumbing in favor of returning to outhouses. Such is the civil effect of taking their modern, rules-based legal system and trying to substitute a throwback authoritarian one, in which the party dictates the verdict.
Lately entire books and conference agendas have been devoted to suggesting, without much evidence, that Donald Trump's election or Britain's Brexit vote heralded a backslide toward authoritarianism. In Hong Kong, China really is testing whether a modern and free city of seven million can be time-machined back to the 19th century and turned into an anachronistic satrapy.
Still, though Daryl Morey, the Houston executive of the indelicate tweet, can be congratulated on the sentiment he expressed, he gets fewer kudos for its timing or needlessly public nature. It boggles the mind that so many insist on playing Twitter roulette with their careers and the commercial interests of their employers. Mr. Morey, considered one of the league's savviest executives, issued his tweet on the eve of important exhibition games in China, whose broadcast on state TV now has been canceled. His partial climb-down, in which he apologized for his lack of enlightenment about how the Hong Kong protests might be viewed by mainland fans, at least did not include a recantation of his support for freedom of speech.
The league's initial kowtow, with a note apologizing for Mr. Morey's ""regrettable"" remarks that ""greatly hurt the feelings of Chinese fans,"" has been partly retrieved by a strong statement of Mr. Silver on Tuesday against censorship even while pointedly (and properly) lamenting the damage caused the league by Mr. Morey's exercise of his personal rights.
The NBA patted itself on the back during football's national anthem controversy for its championing of the free speech of its own players, and less publicly because it already had a rule in place requiring them to stand respectfully for the anthem.
The NBA can be free and easy about player political expression partly because their expressions almost universally have been in line with the urban, liberal bent of the league's fan base. Now the Air Jordan is on the other foot, at least with respect to the league's Chinese fans, and the trade-offs are not so painless. Though premier players become brands unto themselves, Mr. Morey has an audience only because of his job. He might have remembered that. The NFL is not even the worst example of a business that sees its commercial interests damaged by employee politicking on the job. Google is. Its parent company, Alphabet, is now conspicuously fighting its own employees to rein in their use of company time and networks to wage ideological and partisan war against each other.
That said, notice that China's hysterical response has been a tad overblown for a solitary tweet by a single behind-the-scenes functionary of a single team, even if that team was once led by China's own legendary Yao Ming. A big-time selection bias is at work. Plenty of Chinese, rather than wanting to take away Hong Kong's rule of law, want to see it replicated on the mainland. It's a guess but almost surely Chinese NBA fans are disproportionately represented among the country's liberals even if they are prudently not speaking up right now. The NBA may want to keep this in mind before it grovels any further.

Activision's China Problem --- Videogame company turns 'Call of Duty' into a mobile hit at an awful time,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
There would seem to be no bad time to put out a hot new videogame, though Activision Blizzard may have found one.
The videogame company launched ""Call of Duty: Mobile"" last week to great acclaim. It isn't the first mobile game to bear the imprint of the blockbuster game franchise, though it is the first to deliver the sort of robust, multiplayer experience previously available only on the game's console and PC versions. It has been a hit: Downloads of the game hit 100 million in the first week, with gross revenue totaling about $10 million globally, according to Sensor Tower. The mobile version of the megapopular ""Fortnite"" grossed only $3.3 million in its first week, by comparison.
Even more notable is that Activision hit these numbers without China. ""Call of Duty: Mobile"" is still awaiting government approval in the world's largest market for mobile games, which accounts for nearly a third of gaming revenue generated on Apple's iOS platform alone, Sensor Tower estimates.
Expanding into China would give the game a big boost. Yet Activision has just now found itself embroiled in the controversy over Hong Kong's protests.
On Tuesday, the company suspended a player from one of its esports competitions after the player publicly voiced sympathy for the Hong Kong protesters. That gamer played in the league centered on the ""Hearthstone"" game from the company's Blizzard unit. That in turn sparked a backlash in the U.S., with criticism from American politicians and calls by gamers for a boycott of all Blizzard properties. #BoycottBlizzard was a top-trending hashtag on Twitter Wednesday.
Such a boycott would come at an inopportune time for Activision, whose Blizzard unit has struggled due to some underperforming older games and a lack of new ones. Revenue at Blizzard, which mostly specializes in PC games, has fallen in the past two quarters and is expected to be down 28% this year, according to FactSet. The company is widely expected to share plans for new games and expansion content at its annual BlizzCon conference starting Nov. 1, which will be needed for the unit to meet Wall Street's projections for a strong sales recovery next year.
""Call of Duty"" is an even bigger issue, as it remains Activision's most bankable property that typically generates more than $1.5 billion in revenue each year, according to analyst estimates on FactSet. The latest console iteration called ""Modern Warfare"" goes on sale Oct. 25 and is expected to sell well over 20 million units.
But ""Call of Duty"" is also getting long in the tooth, as ""Modern Warfare"" represents the 16th sequel for the game. So the mobile version represents an important expansion opportunity for Activision's key property. That is especially the case in China, where much of the population prefers to play games on phones rather than consoles. Criticism at home may be unpleasant, but the company won't want to risk losing the China market. With its stock price down 30% over the last 12 months on worries about its game pipeline, Activision can't afford to take any chances.

The Weekend Interview with Jimmy Lai: A 'Troublemaker' Faces Hong Kong's Future,"Hong Kong -- Residents of this city love their home and their freedom. China's latest intrusion threatens both, forcing Hong Kong residents to contemplate an imminent future when they'll have to abandon one to cling to the other. Jimmy Lai, a media tycoon who's been called ""the Rupert Murdoch of Asia,"" seems almost hurt when I ask which he will choose.
""I've been one of the troublemakers. I can't just make trouble and then leave,"" he says. ""No, we will stay. Our media will stay until the last day -- until they either close me or close our business, or arrest me or whatever.""
Mr. Lai, 71, has been making trouble for the Chinese government since the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 1989. He's financially supported Hong Kong's pro-democracy political parties and founded the pro-democracy Next magazine in 1990 and Apple Daily in 1995. The publications have criticized the Chinese Communist Party and its influence over Hong Kong politics. When Britain handed the territory's sovereignty to Beijing in 1997, Hong Kong was designated a special administrative region, supposedly governed under the principle ""one country, two systems."" But since President Xi Jinping assumed power in 2012, Beijing has grown even less tolerant of Hong Kong's independence.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam is now pushing a bill through the Legislative Council that would authorize the local government to extradite to mainland China persons deemed fugitives by Beijing, including Hong Kong residents and foreigners. ""If she can do it, she can actually hand over Hong Kong to Xi Jinping, in a cage,"" Mr. Lai says. ""There will be a big reward for her.""
The fugitive law would mean ""that the Chinese so-called judiciary system is going to replace Hong Kong's,"" Mr. Lai says. Beijing could ""nab anybody from here to put in a Chinese jail"" and subject him to unfair trial, arbitrary detention, and worse. Chinese officials could use the power to shake down businessmen. Pro-democracy activists, religious practitioners, lawyers, journalists and booksellers would visit or live in Hong Kong at their own risk.
Mr. Lai would be an obvious target, but he doesn't want to talk about that: ""Why should I think about this? Why should I fear before the fear comes?"" Already he has been conspicuously followed, targeted by hackers, and threatened by Hong Kong's criminal gangs. In 2009 he was the target of a thwarted assassination plot. In 2013 someone left a hatchet and a knife outside his doorstep. In 2015 his house was firebombed. He still gets death threats.
If Mr. Lai has reason to feel vulnerable, so do thousands of Hong Kong people who lack his status, wealth and international mobility. Last Sunday more than a million people, roughly 1 in 7 residents, turned out to protest the extradition bill. On Wednesday thousands braved tear gas and rubber bullets to protest. The manicured streets and upscale shopping malls near the Legislative Council building resembled a war zone.
Ms. Lam has refused to withdraw the bill. Beijing has doubled down in its support, and Hong Kong's protesters have doubled down in opposition. Is another Tiananmen Square in the offing?
Mr. Lai weighs the question. On the one hand, China's rulers don't care about human rights: ""To them, Hong Kong is just a percentage of the total population in China, which is just 0.5%. They don't look at us as a people."" On the other hand, a brutal televised crackdown would look bad: ""When you're sure that the whole world is watching, you have to think twice."" Still, ""it's not totally impossible.""
Mr. Lai believes Mr. Xi is more vulnerable than he looks. Since 1949 the Chinese Communist Party has been a game of thrones, with the toughest political operators prevailing. But Mr. Xi abolished presidential term limits, concentrating power like no leader since Mao. Mr. Lai likens him to a king or emperor presiding over a feudal system: ""The government becomes a court government, the same as in the old times."" That makes enemies of those shut out of power: ""Whenever they see opportunity, they will fight back.""
Mr. Lai describes Mr. Xi as ""definitely a hard-core Communist"" who looks especially strong because technology gives him ""a power of controlling the people unprecedented in human history."" China is creating a surveillance state, using high-tech to track faces, movement and associations.
But Mr. Lai believes Mr. Xi is overreaching: ""When you have concentrated all the power on yourself, you're also concentrating all the responsibility on yourself. Every mistake becomes your mistake. When you have shared power, you have shared responsibility."" Mr. Lai doesn't rule out an internal coup because Mr. Xi is holding ""an impossible job.""
Mr. Lai says China runs on an implicit social contract in which the Communist Party denies the people political liberty but offers economic prosperity. That bargain has come under threat as the U.S. and Europe grow weary of Beijing's abuses of the international order and cyber and intellectual-property theft. Then came Donald Trump, who ""understands the Chinese like no president understood,"" Mr. Lai says. ""I think he's very good at dealing with gangsters.""
China's Communists are ""materialists,"" Mr. Lai says, whereas the old Soviet Union at least had an ideology. The problem for the Chinese is that communism ""has been debunked,"" Mr. Lai says, while the West still has its moral authority, expressed in rule of law and respect for human rights. Mr. Lai sees a clash of civilizations and believes Western values will prevail.
China's investment initiative, known as One Belt, One Road, is running into trouble because of its values -- or rather its lack of them. Beijing assumed that foreign leaders would accept loans at usurious rates if they could take a cut or use it for their own political purposes. But Mr. Lai says Mr. Xi failed to understand that citizens would feel enraged when they learned of corrupt dealings that left their countries in hock to Beijing.
Similarly, with the extradition legislation, Mr. Xi counts on Hong Kong's leaders to sell out their own people for political advancement. But Mr. Lai says Beijing fails to appreciate how the British imparted a reverence for the rule of law to the colony they ruled beginning in 1842. ""For us, colonialism was something that was a gift by God because we were the only Chinese who had freedom,"" Mr. Lai says.
China is betting on might, he says, while Hong Kong is betting on right: ""We don't have weapons. We don't have raw power."" But Hong Kongers do have a lot to lose. Young people were the backbone of this week's protests, but they don't have the money or the ability to immigrate. ""They're stuck. The only alternative is to fight."" The challenge is to keep that fight peaceful.
Mr. Lai speaks admiringly of Christians who stood between protesters and police on Sunday, singing hymns to ease tension. On Wednesday younger protesters stockpiled bricks, which older activists sat on to prevent the youngsters from hurling them at police. ""We have nothing except our moral power, which is exactly what the Chinese government doesn't have,"" Mr. Lai says. ""That's exactly where we can win.""
Yet his mood shifts from optimistic to bleak as he admits that unless Mr. Xi is ousted, the best possible outcome is delay. ""Beijing obviously intends ""to take total control of our freedom,"" Mr. Lai says. Even if the extradition bill is somehow stopped, ""Hong Kong is doomed, because the intention is there.""
Hong Kong nonetheless presents more than one dilemma for Mr. Xi. A reputation for the rule of law made it a global financial capital. ""So if our rule of law is undermined, our financial center status would be sickened,"" Mr. Lai says. The extradition bill has also created a new generation of activists committed to Hong Kong's self-government. Given the booming business between China and Hong Kong, it's harder for Beijing to control information about the protests from spreading inside China.
Hong Kong's relative freedom also attracts wealthy people from the mainland. ""They come here to buy real estate -- not just for the real estate,"" Mr. Lai says. ""By buying real estate and staying here, they're also buying the rule of law, the safety of their life, the freedom, the human-rights protection.""
Mr. Lai's own riches-to-rags-to-riches family history testifies to that allure. His parents had amassed wealth in the shipping industry, but his family was ""very progressive,"" so that ""my father actually tried to help the Communists."" They paid the family back by confiscating its wealth. His father wanted to flee, but the Communists wrongly suspected he had money hidden abroad. He had to borrow money from Hong Kong friends to buy permission to leave.
Once Mr. Lai's father arrived in Hong Kong around 1951 or '52, he was unable to pay his lenders back, so he hid, leaving his family including Jimmy in China. At age 11 Jimmy went to work in a railway station carrying baggage and heard tales of Hong Kong's wealth and opportunity. He pestered his mother for a year to let him leave before she helped him get a permit for Macau, then a Portuguese colony. He made it to Hong Kong by stowing away in a fishing boat and he began work in a clothing factory that produced sweaters and gloves. He was 12.
""The rest is history,"" Mr. Lai says. He became a manager at the factory, used his earnings to invest in the stock market, and bought his own garment factory at 27. Thus began Giordano, which Mr. Lai developed into an international clothing chain. After Tiananmen, Mr. Lai decided to go into media ""because I thought media delivers information -- information is freedom."" Where other publications self-censored, Next and Apple Daily criticized Beijing. Readers loved it.
Mr. Lai became a self-made billionaire by making the most of Hong Kong's economic freedom and rule of law. He now faces the same choice his father once did: With the Chinese Communist Party in charge, should he stay or go? ""I think those guys who think communism or socialism is cool again are those who have never had the history in their blood,"" Mr. Lai says.
He has a British passport, but he says he would never flee Hong Kong. ""If I do that, my kids, my grandkids would despise me. My wife will despise me."" Fighting for Hong Kong has become his life's work. ""How many years do I have to live, 20 years?"" he asks. ""Whatever happens, I will be here.""

EXCHANGE --- Business & Finance News: London Exchange Rejects Offer,"LONDON -- London Stock Exchange Group PLC took a swipe at Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. Friday, rejecting its $36.6 billion bid and questioning Hong Kong's future as a financial gateway to China.
Undeterred, the HKEX said it was disappointed the LSE had failed to properly engage in talks and said it would continue to talk to LSE shareholders about its unsolicited offer.
The U.K. operator said it remains committed to buying financial-information and terminal company Refinitiv Holdings Ltd., a $14.5 billion deal it struck in July that would have been scrapped if the Hong Kong exchange succeeded in its bid.
Shares in LSE rose 3.6% Friday, having already risen almost 6% on Wednesday after HKEX announced its unsolicited offer, surprising investors. Analysts say HKEX could improve its offer with a larger cash component, or that other exchanges may want to bid for the London exchange.
HKEX's bid has led some investors and analysts to question whether a new round of global exchange consolidation is coming, potentially involving the U.S. exchange giants: NYSE parent Intercontinental Exchange Inc., known as ICE, or futures-exchange behemoth CME Group Inc., the world's biggest exchange operator by market cap.
""We'd expect the U.S. exchanges might be viewed as logical additions to fill the North American presence of a truly global exchange model,"" Sandler O'Neill + Partners wrote in a research note Thursday. ICE explored a possible bid for the LSE in 2016 but ultimately backed away.
Representatives of CME and ICE declined to comment.
In a letter to the Hong Kong exchange issued publicly, LSE Chairman Don Robert said LSE's board doesn't believe HKEX is the best partner for its long-term positioning in Asia, and that the company's cash-and-shares offer is unattractive because of ""inherent uncertainty"" around the value of HKEX shares.
""We question the sustainability of HKEX's position as a strategic gateway in the longer term,"" Mr. Robert said. He added that the Shanghai Stock Exchange is its preferred and direct channel to access opportunities in China.
A successful tie-up between LSE and HKEX looked like a long shot to many analysts because of regulatory and political hoops. Hong Kong is reeling from a summer of antigovernment protests that have raised concerns about China's tightening grip on the financial center. London is grappling with Brexit.
The history of the exchange business over the past decade is riddled with failed cross-border deals. Many of these were blocked by regulators out of concerns that a prized national asset would be taken over by foreigners, or that the takeover would give the combined company monopolistic pricing power in crucial financial markets.
LSE's stock has soared ninefold in the past 10 years, compared with a 47% rise in the FTSE 100 index of the U.K.'s largest companies.

World News: Apple Shuts Hong Kong Stores Over Fears of Violence,"HONG KONG -- Tech giant Apple Inc. shut its stores early across the city on Monday as fears of escalating violence linked to weekslong protests spurred concern among businesses and the public.
North of the city Sunday, a mob of white-shirted men stormed a subway station and beat people they accused of taking part in protests, leaving 45 people injured.
Fears of clashes in the northern districts spread on social media, leading some businesses to close or send staff home early on Monday.
Five of the semiautonomous region's six Apple stores shut at 4 p.m., five to six hours ahead of normal closing hours. The remaining store was shut all day. Apple's website referred to Monday's arrangement as ""special store hours.""
A spokeswoman for the Cupertino, Calif., company directed queries to information on store hours on its website.
At a branch of Abercrombie & Fitch Co.'s Hollister in the Causeway Bay area, an employee said some staff were allowed to leave early to get home to Yuen Long, a suburb close to the site of the subway attack. Police on Monday said two people were arrested in connection with the attack.
Estee Lauder Co. at 2:40 p.m. Monday sent a notice to Hong Kong employees, asking those who live in Yuen Long and Tuen Mun, another suburb, to ""leave the office as soon as possible,"" according to an email reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Estee Lauder didn't immediately respond to a request to comment.

"World News: Marchers Demand Hong Kong Leader Quit --- As turnout broadens, protests could spill over into other problems for Beijing","HONG KONG -- Protesters poured into this city's streets for a second Sunday despite the suspension of a controversial bill to expand the government's extradition powers, as a week of demonstrations appeared to be spiraling into a broader political movement.
The turnout, which organizers estimated at nearly two million, was the third mass demonstration in eight days. It was a rejection of a partial walkback by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who a day earlier indefinitely suspended work on the bill, which would allow suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial, but stopped short of scrapping the proposal. Police estimated that 338,000 people had followed the official procession path.
Protesters chanted for the bill to be withdrawn and Mrs. Lam to step down.
The turmoil has thrown Hong Kong governance into crisis and threatens to spill over into problems for China's central government in Beijing, which endorsed the proposal but had largely tried to distance itself from it. Fears over the law have grown into a mass defense of Hong Kong's identity and the legal autonomy that preserves its culture and freedoms from those of mainland China.
Seven hours into the march, Mrs. Lam apologized to the Hong Kong people for mishandling the bill. She promised to accept criticism with sincerity and humility, and reiterated that there was no timeline for discussion of the controversial bill to restart. But she didn't say she would withdraw the bill or step down. That didn't placate march organizers, who encouraged supporters to join a series of smaller-scale events planned for Monday, including strikes and a boycott of classes.
""The scale of the turnout is stunning. This is historic,"" said Antony Dapiran, a lawyer and author of a book on dissent in the city. ""This is Hong Kong coming out peacefully and en masse to give their response to what Lam had to say yesterday. They're saying: No.""
The march followed a week of sporadic protests, including a day of clashes on Wednesday, when police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators, and a massive but largely peaceful rally against the bill by as many as a million people on June 9. On Saturday, a man fell to his death after attaching a banner protesting the extradition bill to a scaffold at Pacific Place mall, near the legislature.
Sunday's protests were broad, with students joined by families pushing children in strollers and elderly in wheelchairs. Shouts of ""Withdraw!"" and ""Step down!"" rang on for hours as protesters marched and could be heard in nearby skyscrapers and residential buildings. Participants clogged major streets for more than a mile. Protesters wore black T-shirts to express outrage at the police response on Wednesday, as well as at Mrs. Lam, organizers said.
They also called for an apology from the police, who they say used a disproportionate amount of force to control crowds on Wednesday, and for those arrested in connection with Wednesday's protests not to be prosecuted.
Others chanted, ""No riot. Only tyranny,"" objecting to the city's classification of Wednesday's demonstration as a riot. People held placards saying ""students aren't violent"" and ""don't kill us."" At least 80 injuries were reported from Wednesday's clash, with a few people requiring hospitalization.
Resistance to the bill reignited the opposition movement after a series of moves over the past two years to silence opposition and erode Hong Kong's liberties. The pro-democracy camp was fractured and, many thought, broken.
""A generation that had been written off has spoken,"" said Jason Y. Ng, convener of the Progressive Lawyers Group and author of several books on the political development of Hong Kong. ""People won't take things lying down anymore when their freedoms are being threatened.""
While Wednesday's demonstrations degenerated into battles between police and protesters -- an unusual scene in Hong Kong -- Sunday's march was peaceful and orderly, even though it was far larger.
The bill they were protesting would allow suspected criminals to be taken across the border to mainland China, to stand trial in its more opaque judicial system, which many see as an encroachment on the legal and political autonomy granted Hong Kong under an arrangement known as ""one country, two systems.""
Mrs. Lam's announcements represent a rare concession. Despite having previously expressed support for the bill, Chinese officials said the city's government had proposed the law independently, a view Mrs. Lam repeated on Saturday.

"There's Hope for Freedom, Even in China","Hong Kong -- Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China from a podium overlooking Tiananmen Square 70 years ago. This year's celebrations, including in Hong Kong, were meant to pay tribute to Mao's successor Xi Jinping.
But the people of Hong Kong have stood up. Millions have marched in protest of Beijing's undemocratic control. As a media man I understand that the coverage of events will disproportionately focus on acts of violence. Please don't let the acts of a desperate few blind the world to the violence and oppression that sustains the regime in Beijing -- and the fundamentally peaceable nature of the Hong Kong people. All we see from our government is a coldblooded campaign of arrests, greater control of private companies such as Cathay Pacific and HSBC, and interference in the teaching at our high schools.
We are fighting for what was promised us. Universal suffrage is a right to which we're entitled in our Basic Law, the miniconstitution that took effect when the U.K. handed over the territory in 1997. Mr. Xi abrogated it in 2014 by imposing limits on elections for Hong Kong's chief executive and members of the Legislative Council, and our rights have been denied to us.
Some find it inconceivable that Beijing would ever give us universal suffrage, but we must persist. We're prepared to make short-term sacrifice to pursue long-term freedom. We believe that if we persist, we may win. China is not as strong as it pretends. What the Communist Party calls its ""socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics"" has run its course. For the past 40 years, China's high-growth economy has been fueled by exports based on cheap labor and Western technology, some borrowed and transferred, in sync with the manipulation of its currency to gain an export advantage. All the while, the West appeased China for the sake of doing more business. The hope was that open trade would encourage an open society. Under Mr. Xi's rule that hope has died.
Individual liberty is what distinguishes both Hong Kong and the West from China. The hustle and bustle of the free market is built on liberty and the rule of law. Without those values, how can China be a trusted member of the world community or a reliable partner of the global business community?
That's why we insist on our values and the importance of basic human rights when we do business with China. We mustn't appease. Failure to confront China on its abuses means we will forever have an unstable, conflict-based global market. If only because of its sheer size -- 1.4 billion people, and what we have to admit is an impressive economic engine -- the world can't expect peace and prosperity if China doesn't change its ways of the past 40 years.
As Hong Kong highlights the moral failings of China, the markets may be seeing the failings of China's economic model. China's labor is no longer cheap, nor can it forcibly transfer technology or steal it as easily as in the past. It can still subsidize state enterprises and manipulate its currency, but with greater difficulties. An added challenge and cost is China's environment. So polluted is the water and so unwelcome the trash incinerators that even in the tightly controlled tyranny that is Mr. Xi's China they fear riots.
Moving into a modern economy is not possible under China's current legal structure, which lacks the rule of law that is a vital feature of Hong Kong life. That lawlessness has always left businesses unprotected. Companies paid bribes as a form of insurance, so that they could complete projects and transactions. Mr. Xi has rooted out much corruption but offered no alternative means for getting things done.
On this 70th anniversary of communism's ascendance in China, the irony is that the only legitimacy the Party has left comes from a growing economy. If China's economy implodes, so does the regime's legitimacy. Even if communist China doesn't fall, Xi Jinping's empire will. When dictatorship competes with democracy, it always comes up short, because it has to divert a great part of its resources to controlling its people. That suffocates society's energy and creativity by impeding the flow of information and ideas.
In 2019, Mr. Xi is arguably the most absolute dictator in human history. Certainly more absolute than Mao, because of his artificial-intelligence-enabled electronic controlling devices, such as facial recognition and ""social credit.""
The trouble is that while Mr. Xi has been happy to use this new innovation of AI-enabled electronic control, he is doing so with Mao's old security apparatus. That requires a vast police force. Outside North Korea, almost no population is under such absolute control. Does anyone imagine an economy can grow in North Korea?
All this control is fueling unprecedented resentment and resistance -- and not only in Hong Kong. Though it is now suppressed in China, there is every chance it will explode when triggered by a serious economic downturn.
The China-U.S. trade war is an epochal event that can push China to the brink of collapse, especially if the U.S. links its values and human rights to its dealings with China. If China agrees to the structural changes America demands in this trade war, it will greatly increase China's cost of doing business. And if Mr. Xi doesn't agree to these structural changes and a deal with America is killed, the flow of foreign currency into China will slow, delivering a potentially fatal blow to an already weakened economy.
The costs and hardships of the trade war to America are real, but they are also short-term. If the U.S. reverts to appeasement, in 20 years China will be not only the biggest economy in the world but the most belligerent. In such a world constant conflict with the U.S. and the West would be inevitable, and likely to be decided on terms favorable to China. The question is whether America is willing to endure short-term sacrifice for long-term peace.
My American friends, we are realists. We are not asking you to send the Seventh Fleet to take on China. The American flags you can see at our rallies are our way of saying that we share your values and we look to you for hope. We in Hong Kong are few in number. But we know that the world will never know genuine peace until the people of China are free. On this National Day of the People's Republic of China, all we ask is that in all your dealings with China, you remember we are fighting your battle.

Violence Erupts In Hong Kong,"HONG KONG -- Police clashed with protesters thronging Hong Kong's airport late Tuesday, with violence flaring at the end of a second straight day of demonstrators overwhelming one of the world's busiest travel hubs.
Without citing specific evidence, President Trump tweeted: ""Our Intelligence has informed us that the Chinese Government is moving troops to the Border with Hong Kong. Everyone should be calm and safe!""
U.S. defense officials declined to confirm Mr. Trump's assertion of a buildup of forces along Hong Kong's border. One military official said Chinese authorities appeared to be wary of using military force to quell the unrest at the moment, cognizant of the possibly severe consequences from such a move.
Social-media accounts run by Chinese state news outlets published on Monday footage of mainland paramilitary police forces arriving in the southern city of Shenzhen, which abuts Hong Kong.
At the airport Tuesday, demonstrators seized two men they suspected of being pro-Beijing infiltrators, and witnesses said they were beaten. In both cases, paramedics had to struggle to extract them from the crowd.
""Everything is out of control right now,"" said one 21-year-old protester. ""This movement doesn't have a leader; everyone does what they want.""
Outbound and inbound flights resumed Wednesday morning. Hong Kong's airport authority said Wednesday it had secured a court injunction ""to restrain persons from unlawfully and wilfully obstructing"" its activities. Local police said Wednesday they had arrested five people.
The escalation at the airport amounts to one of the biggest challenges to authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing since the beginning of the city's summer of discontent. For President Xi Jinping of China, the conflict presents a thorny political dilemma as he grapples with a slowing economy and a trade fight with Washington just months before lavish celebrations of the 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule on Oct. 1.
A crackdown would spark international criticism and put Hong Kong's fragile status at further risk. In a news conference, the city's leader, Carrie Lam, choked back tears and warned that protesters were dragging Hong Kong into ""the abyss.""
The day's spiraling violence showed how volatile the protests are becoming. Hong Kong authorities have begun to respond more severely, with business leaders and officials offering stronger support to quell the unrest as it starts to damage Hong Kong's economy and its global reputation as a safe place to do business.
On mainland China's microblogging service Weibo, users showed footage of one of the men who had been beaten in which he appeared to be unconscious and breathing through an oxygen tube. Many users expressed shock and anger at the assault in online comments.
In comments earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Trump called the developments in Hong Kong a ""very tough situation"" and said he hoped nobody would be hurt or killed.
""I hope it works out for everybody, including China, by the way,"" the Republican president said.
At the airport, the day began with small numbers of black-clad and often masked protesters dotting the arrival hall, some playing the violin and singing. It ended with fierce fights, including one in which protesters grabbed an officer's baton and began beating him with it until he pulled his gun and they ran off.
The airport suspended all check-in activity and advised people not to travel there as the protesters' numbers swelled quickly late in the afternoon. Travelers who tried to pick their way through the crowds were shouted down and cursed at by protesters. A few passengers managed to push their way through.
The mood turned uglier in the evening as protesters turned on a young man among them whom they suspected of being an undercover police officer. Protesters searched his pockets and said they found an identification card bearing a name matching one in an online database of police officers in Shenzhen.
At one point, some protesters suggested they would let the man go but others dissented. A handful of airport officials attempted to intervene but were rebuffed. A small group of protesters tied the man up and shuffled him around the stiflingly hot airport hall for three hours, chanting ""Bear the consequences.""
Later in the evening a second man was seized by protesters and accused of being in league with the police. They detained him and emptied his bags, finding a blue shirt emblazoned with a slogan supporting the police and a business card of a member of a pro-Beijing organization.
Protesters surrounded him and beat him as he lay on the floor. The editor in chief of the Global Times, a pro-government Chinese tabloid, tweeted that the man was a reporter with the paper and asked the protesters to release him. Medics made their way to the injured man and carried him to a waiting ambulance.
British Airways and Virgin Atlantic offered travelers scheduled on flights departing Hong Kong this week the option to rebook for later in the month. British Airways said it would offer customers the option of a full refund.
A spokesman for Lufthansa, the German flag carrier, said that its flights departing Hong Kong Tuesday for Munich and Frankfurt would continue as scheduled. But due to the airport disruption at the departures security gate, only passengers connecting in Hong Kong from other cities would be able to board.
Tuesday's disruptions were a further blow to Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong's flag carrier, which has come under heavy pressure from China over employees who join the protesters.
On Monday, the airline said it would fire staff who participated in unauthorized protests. On Tuesday, parent company Swire Pacific said it shared the Chinese government's view of the city's future and condemned what it called illegal acts that threatened the ""one country, two systems"" principle under which Hong Kong maintains some autonomy under Chinese rule. Cathay's shares fell 2.6% Tuesday.
Other core municipal facilities were also affected by protests Tuesday. Staff for at least eight public hospitals went out on strike. Hundreds of doctors, nurses and paramedics staged a walkout at Queen Mary, one of the city's largest public hospitals, in protest of what they saw as police brutality during the previous weekend's demonstrations.
Protests have embroiled Hong Kong this summer, sparked by a proposed law that would have allowed the Chinese government to extradite and prosecute Hong Kong citizens. A broad swath of the city's residents rallied in opposition to the law.
Hong Kong's government declared the bill dead in response, but thousands of Hong Kongers continue to demonstrate, calling for an inquiry into police conduct and a more democratic government.
By early Wednesday morning the number of protesters had dwindled to a few stragglers and the airport started to bounce back to life, with passengers arriving on red-eye flights walking out into the detritus of the day's protest. Posters and signs remained scattered on the floor.
A group of protesters huddled on the departures level going over the personal items of one of the two men held by the protesters hours earlier.
Asked if he believed the taking of the two hostages could diminish support for their cause among moderate Hong Kongers, one demonstrator said: ""Yes we risk losing support, but if we handle this well we can win back the support and more.""
A fellow protester said the risk of losing support was worth the upside of disrupting the airport. ""We have to do everything we can,"" he said. ""This is our last resort.""

Stocks Tread Water Before Fed Meeting,"The S&P 500 inched lower as investors looked ahead to a Federal Reserve meeting that many anticipate will result in the first interest-rate cut since 2008.
Stocks have flirted with records for much of the summer as investors have bet on the Fed lowering rates by as much as half a percentage point at the end of its two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday.
Bets on a rate cut have helped buoy stocks, even as data have shown the domestic and global economy slowing.
""The Fed is very proactive,"" said Xavier Baraton, global chief investment officer for fixed income at HSBC Global Asset Management. ""They want to engineer a soft landing and pre-empt the more tangible signs of slowdown -- they feel they have the wiggle room to do that because there is no inflation.""
The S&P 500 fell 4.89 points, or 0.2%, to 3020.97, retreating from its Friday record close. The Nasdaq Composite lost 36.88 points, or 0.4%, to 8293.33. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 28.90 points, or 0.1%, to 27221.35.
Investors will get a fresh look Tuesday at the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the price index for personal-consumption expenditures, as well as the Labor Department's monthly employment report Friday.
Declines in technology shares pulled the Nasdaq lower, with Advanced Micro Devices losing 54 cents, or 1.6%, to $33.48, and Micron Technology falling 67 cents, or 1.4%, to $46.82.
The S&P 500 technology sector has jumped 5.5% in July, outpacing the broader S&P 500's 2.7% gain.
""What really worked last week is where people are taking some profits today,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Holdings.
Between the Fed meeting, earnings and U.S.-China trade talks, investors are looking at a ""relatively catalyst-full week with all of those having the ability to disappoint,"" Mr. Hogan added.
Meanwhile, deal news and earnings drove swings among individual stocks.
Mylan shares jumped $2.32, or 13%, to $20.78 after Pfizer agreed to merge its off-patent drugs business with the generic drugmaker, creating a global seller of lower-price medicines in an increasingly competitive business. Pfizer dropped $1.64, or 3.8%, to $41.45.
Booz Allen Hamilton shares rose $2.34, or 3.4%, to $71.54 after the management and consulting firm reported better-than-expected earnings.
Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 edged up less than 0.1% to notch its sixth gain in seven trading sessions.
Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index ended the day down 1% as protests in the city grew increasingly violent, triggering concerns about the impact tensions with Beijing could have on the economy.
""Many shopping malls and stores have been closed . . . due to the massive protests, while people are turning more cautious in their spending,"" said Castor Pang, head of research at Core-Pacific Yamaichi in Hong Kong. ""That is definitely going to hurt Hong Kong's economy.""
Shares of property firms New World Development Co., Henderson Land Development Co. and Swire Pacific Ltd. fell at least 2% apiece.
Early Tuesday, the Hang Seng was up 0.6%.
South Korea's Kospi lost 1.8% Monday, logging its fourth consecutive session of declines. Early Tuesday, it was up 0.6%. The country has felt the brunt of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China.

Beijing Tries To Bully Congress,"China took the extraordinary step earlier this month of denying visas to a bipartisan American congressional delegation. We were barred from the country for one reason only -- our planned visit to Taiwan.
Chinese officials told members of my staff on multiple occasions that if I canceled the trip to Taiwan, I would be granted a visa. This was visa blackmail, designed to stanch the longstanding tradition of robust U.S. congressional engagement with Taiwan, which is especially critical given the executive branch's self-imposed limit on official travel.
When we made clear that canceling the delegation's stop in Taiwan was not an option, the officials demanded that I issue a statement endorsing Beijing's version of the ""one China policy,"" which holds that mainland China is the only sovereign China, delegitimizing Taiwan's political existence and further isolating the island's 24 million people.
Undoubtedly Beijing is threatened by what Taiwan demonstrates -- that a distinctly Chinese democracy can thrive. Taiwan's political success challenges the lies and excuses of the authoritarian Chinese Communist Party. Accordingly, Chinese President Xi Jinping has used economic coercion and military pressure to try to strangle the island's democracy and force it to reunify with the mainland. In recent years major U.S. companies, including Marriott Hotels and United, Delta and American Airlines, have been pressured into removing from their websites references to Taiwan as a country.
Most critically, China interfered in Taiwan's 2018 municipal elections through massive state-sponsored disinformation campaigns and illicit funding of pro-Beijing candidates. There are signs that China seeks to use the same playbook in Taiwan's January 2020 presidential election.
China's intense interest in suppressing American support for the protests in Hong Kong and the more than a million Uighurs unlawfully detained in Xinjiang stems from a similar logic as its efforts to limit engagement with Taiwan -- the need to control the international narrative. As the National Basketball Association and other American companies have learned, China deems these ""sensitive"" topics off-limits for anyone seeking to engage commercially with Beijing.
On Oct. 8, the Chinese foreign ministry's spokesman stated repeatedly that U.S. businesses, including the NBA, would be unwelcome in China if they didn't conform to Chinese public opinion. By pushing propaganda degrading the Hong Kong protesters and Uighur detainees, China fans the flames of nationalism, promoting boycotts of U.S. enterprises that dare to depart from the party line.
U.S. companies, increasingly reliant on the Chinese market, are then forced to choose between their bottom lines and core American values. They often accede to China's demands. Last week Apple decided to remove HKmap.live, which had allowed Hong Kongers to track police movements through crowd-sourced inputs, from its App Store.
Turning away members of Congress is only the latest step. Chinese officials would be wise to accept that the U.S. has an abiding interest in fulfilling its obligations under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which calls for robust unofficial ties between the U.S. and Taiwan. Ham-handed and obtusely enforced pressure campaigns, such as the one targeting my delegation, will invigorate congressional support for Taiwan.
In the coming months, I will explore ways for Congress to reinforce U.S. support for Taiwan in a manner consistent with our shared national security interests. While this support is materially necessary given the intense pressure Taiwan faces from China, it is also a moral imperative. America must stand up for democracy and freedom in the face of the Chinese Communist Party's aggression and authoritarianism.

World News: Hong Kong Boils Over in Week of Rage,"HONG KONG -- Antigovernment protesters and police shocked Hong Kong with some of the ugliest incidents in nearly six months of unrest this week, leaving the city's leaders scrambling for a way to restore order under increasing pressure from Beijing.
A 70-year-old man died Thursday night after being hit in the head with a brick during a clash a day earlier. A 15-year-old boy was in critical condition on Wednesday, according to the Hospital Authority, which declined to comment on his current status. Local media said he suffered injuries after appearing to be hit in the head by a tear-gas canister. And police shot a 21-year-old protester on Monday; later, pro-democracy demonstrators set a man who argued with them on fire.
Clashes between protesters and police this week turned universities into battlefields, rendered highways and tunnels unusable, disrupted public transit and frequently left the city's bustling financial district under a fog of tear gas.
Shops across the city closed, further crippling an economy that has already tumbled into a recession. The Hang Seng Index, the city's stock market, dropped 4.8%, its worst week since early August. Schools shut down because of the violence and it isn't certain if district council elections, scheduled for Nov. 24, can go forward.
Both sides have taken more aggressive stances in recent days, with black-clad youths throwing Molotov cocktails and bricks while police have made heavy use of tear gas, rubber bullets, batons and water cannons to try to disperse crowds. Police have arrested 653 people this week, ranging in age from 12 to 82. The police on Friday said they are treating the death of the 70-year-old man as a murder.
The escalation in violence has hurt the already low public perception of police and risks additional erosion of support for the protesters. On Wednesday evening, demonstrators set a courthouse in the northern part of the city on fire, an attack that was condemned by the Hong Kong Bar Association.
""It is difficult to think of anything that is more corrosive to the rule of law,"" the bar association said. ""Attacks on private property are bad enough but if attacks on court buildings continue, the constitutional fabric of [Hong Kong] will be torn asunder with disastrous consequences for every Hong Kong resident.""
Government officials, including Chief Executive Carrie Lam, gathered Wednesday for a late-night meeting, although Matthew Cheung, the city's chief secretary, described it the next day as an ordinary assembly. He said Wednesday's meeting was intended ""to find ways to ease the current situation.""
Antony Dapiran, a lawyer and the author of a forthcoming book on the protests, said he has seen an increase in disruption this week to the everyday lives of people who aren't involved in the protest movement. ""This anger is not subsiding. It seems to be getting worse,"" he said.
The protests, sparked earlier this year by a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed suspects to be extradited to China for trial, have morphed into a broader antigovernment movement. Many demonstrators are focusing their anger on alleged police brutality. Paralyzing the city for an entire week marked an escalation in the protesters' strategy, as they previously demonstrated mainly on weekends.
Streets across the city were still filled with bricks Friday. Protesters had cemented some of them into place, building walls and other obstacles to block roads and slow police.
Students had turned several university campuses into battlezones. By Friday, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and the Chinese University of Hong Kong had largely emptied out after they and others suspended classes for the rest of the semester, which ends in early December.
But hard-core protesters said they were resting for later demonstrations. Fortifications remained at the entrances to the two universities. At PolyU, the protesters informed visitors they were at a ""border crossing"" and checked identification and bags.

World News: Hong Kong Police Make Arrests in Rally That Turned Violent,"HONG KONG -- Police arrested and charged a dozen protesters suspected of involvement in clashes and widened a hunt for others who joined a rampage through the city's legislature.
The arrests signal that the government is pressing a newfound advantage, after it was caught off-guard by a wave of popular rallies that scotched its attempt to drive through an unpopular extradition law. Officials were forced to suspend the bill, which would have moved the semiautonomous city closer within Beijing's legal jurisdiction. The concession emboldened younger activists to challenge the government more strongly.
But Monday's violent storming of the legislature, broadcast blow by blow on live television, shocked swaths of the city. Though many say they understand that protesters were driven to frustration by the government's intransigence, the mayhem handed an opening to Hong Kong's government to take a tougher approach.
Beijing on Tuesday voiced its displeasure with the protests, calling the occupation of the legislature a challenge to the political arrangement that gives Hong Kong its limited autonomy -- a suggestion that China would directly intervene if events spiral beyond Hong Kong's control.
Police said Thursday that the 12 people who were arrested range in age from 14 to 36. They were charged with offenses including possession of offensive weapons, unlawful assembly and assaulting and obstructing a police officer. The charges relate to a confrontation between hundreds of protesters and police outside a flag-raising ceremony Monday morning to commemorate Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule from the British in 1997.
Hong Kong's handling of the unrest, and the Chinese government's tightening grip on the city, have fueled a diplomatic spat between Beijing and London.
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, one of two candidates to become the next prime minister, this week called on Beijing not to use the protests as a ""pretext for repression,"" and urged the Chinese government to honor a 1984 agreement between the two countries to uphold the city's autonomy.
""He seems to be basking in the faded glory of British colonialism,"" China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a media briefing Wednesday. ""The U.K. considers itself as a guardian, which is nothing but a delusion.""
The barbs continued as China's ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, called a press conference to extend Beijing's criticism of Mr. Hunt's comments. In response, Britain's Foreign Office summoned Mr. Liu for a dressing down.
The Chinese government has for years regarded the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration as ""a historic document without realistic meaning,"" state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
Two weeks ago in Hong Kong, police took an almost entirely hands-off approach as thousands of mostly young protesters surrounded and barricaded its headquarters, pelting the building with eggs and defacing its walls.
On Wednesday, police said officers had collected evidence from the legislature building and were preparing to track down protesters involved in the storming of the Legislative Council on Monday.
Protesters are planning another march on Sunday in a shopping area in Hong Kong frequented by mainland Chinese tourists, aimed at raising awareness among Chinese people of the recent events in Hong Kong.

The NFL's Plans for China Slipped Away,"During the halftime show of the 2004 Super Bowl, an image briefly aired with the potential to offend billions of people. No, not that image.
This picture was on television screens around the world for less than one second. But that was all it took to upset the NFL's most lucrative untapped market: China.
The matchup between the Carolina Panthers and New England Patriots that year isn't remembered so much for what happened in the game but what happened when the players were in the locker room. This was the Super Bowl when Justin Timberlake exposed Janet Jackson's nipple during the halftime performance -- a moment that immediately became the subject of raging controversy in the U.S.
But this was also the Super Bowl that was supposed to celebrate the NFL's arrival in China. It was the first one broadcast nationwide on CCTV-5, a sports channel on the government's primary network that the league estimated at the time could mean a viewership of 300 million.
And that was the problem.
During the halftime show, a minute-long montage aired that was meant to be an innocuous tribute to freedom that would encourage people to vote. Included in the segment: the iconic photo of a dissident standing in front of tanks leaving Tiananmen Square after the 1989 protests in Beijing. It was an image that had been virtually scrubbed from China until it shockingly appeared on this Super Bowl broadcast.
But the exquisite timing of the most famous wardrobe malfunction in television history managed to distract from this other incident that occurred minutes earlier. And the tension over this picture, with the potential to torpedo the NFL's fledgling business in China, barely received any attention in the U.S. American audiences were rapt by something else they weren't expecting to see during the halftime show.
""That was massively overshadowed by the Janet Jackson incident,"" said Bill Roedy, then the chief executive of MTV Networks International, which staged the halftime performance.
The risks of a misstep in China's political minefield for leagues trying to build a fan base in the world's most populous country have been vividly displayed over the past week as the NBA was rocked by a since-deleted tweet by Houston Rockets executive Daryl Morey supporting protesters in Hong Kong.
Football, known literally as ""olive ball"" in China, doesn't have the same international presence as basketball. But the potential to offend Beijing's political sensibilities and watch carefully laid plans change dramatically overnight is one area where the NFL can sympathize with the NBA.
The NFL and its broadcasting partners were aware of the challenges they faced when they made China the sight of their ambitions. Chad Lewis, a former tight end who speaks Mandarin and was one of the CCTV commentators for that Super Bowl broadcast, said he was given instructions on how to explain football to the unfamiliar Chinese audience. He was also told to stay away from certain sensitive issues.
""Here are our talking points, here are things to avoid,"" Lewis recalled.
Those efforts were derailed halfway through the game, when Chinese audiences saw an image that, until the Super Bowl, had been taboo in their country.
The montage showed the likes of Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks and Muhammad Ali in addition to the Tiananmen Square photo. It was whipped together at the last minute, a person familiar with the incident said, because of the NFL's discomfort with dedicating so much time to addressing the AIDS epidemic, which had been the initial plan for that slot. Nobody from the NFL screened the replacement montage before it aired, another person said.
But the plan to create international harmony did not exactly go as the league anticipated. The only relief for the NFL's international headache was that it escaped the attention of Americans who were too busy obsessing about Janet Jackson's exposed nipple.
""Once it gets in the headlines,"" Roedy said, ""you lose the ability to negotiate behind the scenes.""
His team at MTV International had people based in China ready to handle the fallout, and Roedy himself later flew across the world for the round of apologies that he understood was necessary to retain their business. The NFL nevertheless faced a severe rebuke in China. CCTV dropped coverage of its games just as the league was hoping to ramp up their distribution. The following year, the Super Bowl was carried by a separate broadcaster in Shanghai that lacked the same national reach as CCTV.
Even when the NFL got back in China's good graces a few years later, the league faced a new challenge to smooth tensions in this elusive market.
The Patriots and Seattle Seahawks were scheduled to visit China for a preseason game in 2007 hyped as a landmark event dubbed the ""China Bowl."" But in the build-up to the game, the NFL was concerned about the readiness of the stadium to safely and effectively host the game, two people familiar with the discussions said, and those fears ultimately drove a decision to call it off.
The game was never rescheduled. But the league stayed out of trouble with China, and NFL games are widely available in China today. The league's strategy in China now includes online streaming of games -- it claims 140 million watch the Super Bowl -- plus events built around personal appearances of star players. The league still dreams of a bigger foothold in China, which NFL commissioner Roger Goodell recently said was a ""priority market.""

Hong Kong Exchange Bids for London Rival,"Hong Kong's stock exchange made an unsolicited $36.6 billion offer to acquire its London-based rival, a deal that would unite two of the world's major trading hubs when both are under severe political pressure.
Hong Kong is reeling from a summer of increasingly violent protests, with scenes of tear gas and Molotov cocktails playing out virtually every weekend on live television. London, meanwhile, is gripped by political paralysis as successive governments fail to find a way to implement an exit from the European Union due to take place next month.
And yet Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. has picked this moment to launch what would be its biggest deal. A combination with the London Stock Exchange would create a global leader in capital flows and financial data by connecting developed and emerging markets in the East and West. It would also thwart the LSE's ambitions to transform itself from an exchange into a full-fledged data business by acquiring financial-information provider Refinitiv Holdings Ltd., which used to be part of Reuters, for $14.5 billion in stock.
The Hong Kong group's approach and its public announcement Wednesday took the LSE's leadership off guard, a person familiar with the matter said.
Charles Li, the exchange's chief executive, met his counterpart at the LSE, David Schwimmer, and the LSE chairman in London on Monday, the person said. The HKEX asked for the meeting, saying that some of its executives would be in the city that day, and the LSE assumed it was a general meeting with no specific agenda, the person said. But when the two sides met, Mr. Li surprised LSE executives by presenting the proposal, and a letter detailing the proposal followed later Monday, the person said.
The LSE's board will determine the company's next move when it meets, the person said. The date of that meeting couldn't be learned.
The public disclosure of the offer came Wednesday. The Hong Kong exchange decided to make its offer public so that shareholders of both companies could assess its merits, according to another person familiar with the matter.
""You don't choose timing, you choose what is the right thing to do,"" Mr. Li said during a conference call Wednesday.
The London exchange criticized the offer as ""preliminary and highly conditional."" It said it would consider the proposal but remains committed to the Refinitiv deal.
""We are here like a corporate Romeo and Juliet,"" Mr. Li, said. ""We know we were late . . . . We want to openly express our admiration.""
The Hong Kong exchange could face significant political hurdles to completing a deal. The U.K. government could refuse to approve a potential takeover of LSE because it forms too critical a part of the country's financial infrastructure, according to people familiar with the matter. U.S. regulators will also have a say in whether a deal can proceed if the offer gains traction.
""Any regulator would need to think carefully about the implications of the political situation and Beijing's increasing control over Hong Kong,"" said David Webb, an outspoken private investor in Hong Kong. ""This strikes me as an aspirational proposal that probably won't go through.""
""This has nothing to do with Hong Kong's situation,"" Mr. Li said.
The Hong Kong exchange said its offer -- valued at GBP 29.6 billion in cash and stock -- represents a 22.9% premium to the London exchange's closing stock price on Tuesday. It proposed paying about a quarter of the purchase price in cash and the rest in stock.
""This is an audacious move,"" said Larry Tabb, founder and research chairman of the financial markets research and advisory firm Tabb Group. ""LSE is one of the few really prestigious global exchange brands.""
The London Stock Exchange, which traces its history back hundreds of years, has proven one of the world's most difficult acquisition targets over the past two decades. German rival Deutsche Boerse AG has twice failed to take over the exchange, as has the technology-heavy U.S. exchange Nasdaq Inc. A Swedish exchange and Australian investment bank Macquarie Group also haven't completed takeovers.
""This deal seems so out of left field, especially after Refinitiv,"" said Brad Bailey, research director for capital markets at Celent in New York. ""I was very surprised.""
If the Hong Kong exchange's bid for LSE succeeds, it would create an Asian-European giant that would rival the two biggest players in the global exchange business, both of them U.S. firms: Chicago-based CME Group Inc. and Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange Inc., or ICE.
CME has a market capitalization of over $72 billion, while ICE -- the parent of the New York Stock Exchange -- is worth about $50 billion. Both U.S. firms rode a wave of consolidation in the exchange business over the past two decades to amass more heft than their European and Asian rivals.
Mr. Li, in a blog post on the Hong Kong exchange's website, said the proposal comes after ""many months of consideration"" and marks a milestone for the city, which has built itself into a global financial center as China's economic growth has accelerated. He said a partnership between the two exchanges ""will strengthen ties between the U.K. and China, particularly in economic and trade terms.""
The Hong Kong exchange dominates its home market and has thrived by plugging mainland China into the global financial system, initially through hosting stock listings, and more recently through trading arrangements that connect the world's investors to otherwise hard-to-access markets in Shenzhen and Shanghai.
Last year it made a record profit of about $1.2 billion, equal to nearly 59 cents out of every dollar it took in as revenue or in other ways, chiefly as income on investments.
Hong Kong is a crucial thruway for capital flows into and out of China. The exchange was the world's biggest for initial public offerings last year, lifted by multibillion-dollar share sales by several of China's most valuable technology and internet companies.
The dollar value of new listings in Hong Kong has shrunk sharply this year, and trading has slowed, as trade tensions, China's economic slowdown and unrest in the city have dented market sentiment.

World News: China Warns of Intervention Over Hong Kong Unrest,"BEIJING -- A senior Chinese official in charge of Hong Kong affairs warned that Beijing would intervene if the local government proved unable to contain the violent protests, the most explicit threat of intervention to date from the central government.
At a meeting with Hong Kong representatives in the nearby city of Shenzhen on Wednesday, the official, Zhang Xiaoming, issued a dire assessment of the situation in the territory after more than two months of protests. He called the situation the most severe since China resumed sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.
""If the situation worsens further, and there is turmoil that the Hong Kong government is unable to control, the central government absolutely will not just watch without doing anything,"" Mr. Zhang, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of China's State Council, said in remarks carried by official state media.
Though Mr. Zhang didn't lay out options for intervention, he said the central government had ""enough methods and enough strength"" to quickly quell the unrest.
Adam Ni, a China researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney, said the meeting was likely held to discuss methods for resolving the crisis with Hong Kong's elite and to show that Beijing will back up Hong Kong's government.
""The one big thing that I think Beijing fears is if the pro-establishment camp breaks down and really loses the will to confront the protesters,"" he said. ""It's really about reinforcing the notion that the party center is behind them, with military force if necessary.""
Beijing has in recent days expressed its concern that the protests were spiraling out of control and challenging China's sovereignty over the territory, a former British colony that has limited autonomy under Chinese rule. The demonstrations started as protests against an extradition bill proposed by the local government, but have turned increasingly violent and pointedly critical of Chinese rule, with protesters targeting the national flag and state seal.
Mr. Zhang's warning of intervention was more direct than in recent days when officials signaled that Beijing's patience was wearing thin. A day earlier in Shenzhen, more than 10,000 mainland police officers ran through antiriot drills, a video of which was circulated online as a show of force.
Still, Beijing faces invidious options if it moves to intervene. Use of troops in a military garrison in Hong Kong or of riot police brought in from other parts of China would likely bring international opprobrium, damage confidence in the territory's role as an international finance center and be seen by many in Hong Kong as undermining its rule of law.
Wednesday's gathering included more than 500 representatives, including Hong Kong delegates to China's legislature and leaders of pro-Beijing groups in the city, and others in attendance. A similar meeting had been held in 2014 when a swath of Hong Kong's central area was occupied by protesters demanding full democratic elections.
Wang Zhimin, Beijing's top official in Hong Kong, called the standoff a ""life and death war.""
Mr. Zhang said the protests had the markings of a ""color revolution."" The term refers to democratic movements that have unseated authoritarian governments in countries such as Serbia, Georgia and Ukraine.

World News: China Blames U.S. for Hong Kong Protests --- State media publishes family details about a top diplomat who met with opposition,"China ratcheted up its accusations of U.S. involvement in fomenting protests in Hong Kong, spotlighting a top diplomat in state media, as the restive city prepared for a 10th weekend of demonstrations under the threat that Beijing could step in.
Hundreds of black-clad protesters began a three-day sit-in at the city's international airport on Friday, while several demonstrations planned for the weekend were banned by the local police. That could give rise to further clashes, days after Beijing warned it could intervene directly if Hong Kong authorities were unable to quell the unrest on their own.
The protests come amid rising trade tensions between the U.S. and Beijing. Chinese officials have accused the U.S. of encouraging protesters to undermine the government, though the Trump administration has offered guidance to officials to maintain a measured response in an effort to avoid derailing U.S. efforts on trade talks. U.S. diplomatic representatives in Hong Kong have met with senior government officials.
On Thursday and Friday, Beijing-backed media outlets circulated a photo of Julie Eadeh, the political unit chief of the U.S. consulate general in Hong Kong, meeting in a hotel lobby with prominent members of the opposition, including 22-year-old Joshua Wong, a key figure in protests that rocked Hong Kong five years ago.
The reports, in the China Daily and other mainland outlets, pointed to the meeting as evidence that a U.S. ""black hand"" was behind the protests. Tai Kung Pao, a Beijing-backed newspaper in Hong Kong, called Ms. Eadeh an expert in subversion with experience in Iraq. It publicized the names of her children and husband, citing a church publication from her hometown. The narrative and some of the personal details were reposted on numerous mainland Chinese publications and websites.
State broadcaster CCTV said Friday that the Central Intelligence Agency was known for instigating ""color revolutions,"" a reference to demonstrations that sprang up in former Soviet states during the previous decade. Beijing officials also said this week that the Hong Kong unrest had the markings of a color revolution.
A spokesman for the U.S. consulate general in Hong Kong said Ms. Eadeh wasn't available to comment, and referred questions to Washington.
A State Department spokeswoman said Thursday that Beijing's circulation of Ms. Eadeh's personal information was unacceptable and showed China is a ""thuggish regime,"" using the epithet twice. A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy denied that Washington was behind the protests, saying that the Hong Kong demonstrations reflected residents' concerns about eroding autonomy.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's Hong Kong Commissioner's Office on Friday said the U.S. remarks revealed again the ""dark and twisted side of U.S. psychology.""
Mr. Wong said Friday that neither he nor his group receive any funding, supplies or advice from the U.S. government.

"Bank, Technology Sectors Lift Stocks","U.S. stocks kicked off the week with gains, buoyed by a rally among shares of banks and technology companies.
Companies that have reeled on escalating trade tensions jumped after U.S. officials said over the weekend that the White House was laying the groundwork for a new round of trade talks with Beijing. President Trump added on Twitter that the U.S. was ""doing very well with China, and talking.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 249.78 points, or 1%, to 26135.79. The S&P 500 added 34.97 points, or 1.2%, to 2923.65 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 106.82 points, or 1.4%, to 8002.81.
The sharp drop in global bond yields throughout 2019 has ""given a little insulation to the equity market,"" making stocks look attractive even amid a slowdown in earnings growth, said Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at Boston Private.
Ms. Saccocia said she would be keeping a close eye, however, on signs that the U.S.-China trade fight is affecting hiring or consumer spending -- two areas that have shown resilience even as the manufacturing sector has shown signs of weakening.
Technology stocks helped lift the broader market, with Micron Technology rising $1.46, or 3.4%, to $45.01 and Nvidia adding 11.22, or 7%, to 170.78. Semiconductor companies have swung the past few months as investors have weighed the risk of increasing trade restrictions cutting into firms' profits.
Bank stocks, which have slid the past couple of months alongside global bond yields, also climbed. Goldman Sachs rose 2.78, or 1.4%, to 202.20 and Citigroup advanced 83 cents, or 1.3%, to 64.31.
As stocks rose, bond yields rebounded from their recent lows. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.603% from 1.540% Friday, although it remained well below the 2.684% where it ended last year. Yields, which rise as prices fall, have been pressured in recent months by rising fears about the economy's health.
Later this week, investors will parse minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting, as well as hear from central-bank leaders meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyo.
Bond investors will also be focused on speculation around a major stimulus package from the European Central Bank and German fiscal stimulus, said Commerzbank strategist Rainer Guntermann. Germany plans to sell a new 30-year bund on Wednesday.
The Stoxx Europe 600 added 1.1%, led by gains in its basic-resources, autos and banking sectors. Germany's DAX rose 1.3%.
European bank shares have gained on easing recession fears, having been ""priced to a disaster scenario,"" said Patrick Spencer, vice chairman of equities at Baird. ""They're in the bargain bin,"" he added.
In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 2.2% to notch its best performance since June after large-scale protests over the weekend ended peacefully.
The Shanghai Composite rose 2.1%, while indexes in Japan and South Korea gained less than 1% apiece.
Chinese shares got a boost after China's central bank over the weekend announced an overhaul to its interest-rate mechanism that is widely expected to result in easier monetary policy.
Shenzhen-listed technology firms and brokerages were among the biggest gainers, getting a lift from a proposed change to share-listing policy.
In early trading Tuesday, the Hang Seng and Shanghai Composite were each down 0.1%. At midday Tuesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 was up 0.4%, South Korea's Kospi was up 0.5% and Australia's S&P ASX 200 was up 0.8%. The dollar was down to 106.57 yen.

Hong Kong Protesters Defy Beijing,"HONG KONG -- Demonstrators staged the biggest rally challenging China's authority over the city since Britain ceded control in 1997, marching through streets for hours to protest a proposed law that would let Beijing take people across the border to stand trial in the mainland.
Organizers estimated more than a million people -- almost one for every seven residents in the city -- took to the streets to demand the city's leaders and their political masters in Beijing shelve the law. Police estimated 240,000 protesters took part at the peak of Sunday's march.
A snaking crowd that included young families, students, professionals and the elderly streamed through the city, reflecting unprecedented and widespread opposition to the latest move by Beijing to bring the former colony to heel. Critics said the proposed law could be abused to target political dissidents and would expose citizens to the mainland's more opaque legal system, where detainees could be unfairly jailed and abused.
The protest was peaceful for much of the day, with demonstrators chanting ""Go Hong Kongers!"" and patiently lining up in sweltering heat to reach the final rallying point at government headquarters. Around midnight, after most had dispersed, hundreds of protesters brawled with police near the city's Legislature. Some protesters hurled metal barricades, while police fired pepper spray back.
Anger at the proposal has reinvigorated public opposition to Beijing that had dwindled after 2014, when authorities faced down a pro-democracy movement that occupied streets for 79 days in the central business district. Since then, Beijing's room for dissent has shrunk as the government has jailed protesters, declared a pro-independence political party illegal and expelled a foreign journalist.
Foreign business groups and diplomats have warned the extradition proposal poses a threat to the rule of law that helped Hong Kong prosper for decades as an international financial center and base for foreign companies, arguing it breaks China's promise to preserve the city's relative autonomy until at least 2047.
The estimated turnout was double that of a similar protest in 2003, when 500,000 people marched against proposed national-security legislation that was later withdrawn by the government.
Unlike then, however, Beijing now has a much tighter grip on the city and has increasingly moved to silence opposition voices.
Meanwhile, China's economy and global clout have grown considerably, and China's leadership will count on support from a Chinese public that sees Hong Kongers as spoiled.
The city's government said after the march that it will press ahead with the bill, which is due for a second reading in the Legislature on Wednesday.
Officials said the law is needed so Hong Kong doesn't become a refuge for criminals. The proposal was spurred by a case of a man who allegedly murdered his girlfriend in Taiwan in February 2018 and fled back to Hong Kong, but he couldn't be extradited because the jurisdictions don't have an agreement.
Public opposition to the extradition bill has persisted even after the city's leader, Carrie Lam, watered down the proposal slightly by narrowing the number of offense categories liable to extradition to 37 from 46.
After taking the unusual move of bypassing a review committee for the second reading, the government has enough votes to pass the law within a few weeks, having used legal action to oust several democratically elected opposition legislators from office over the past few years.
""This is a crisis for Carrie Lam and her administration,"" said Antony Dapiran, a lawyer and author of a book on dissent in the city. ""The government can't be seen to be caving immediately in the face of protest, but how can they just ignore one million people on the streets?""
Ms. Lam's government has said fears about the law are unfounded and stressed that only those suspected of serious crimes punishable by at least seven years in prison would be subject to extradition.
Officials said there would be safeguards against abuse and that the law wouldn't damage the city's business environment or relate to offenses of a political nature.
China's Foreign Ministry didn't respond to a request for comment on the protests and their potential impact on the proposed extradition law. Phone and fax lines to China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, which oversees Beijing's policies to those territories, rang unanswered on Sunday.
A U.S. State Department official said on Sunday that Washington is ""closely monitoring and concerned by the Hong Kong government's proposed amendments"" to the extradition law. ""Continued erosion of the 'One country, two systems' framework puts at risk Hong Kong's long-established special status in international affairs.""
The mass turnout, with crowds marching through roads up to six lanes wide for more than a mile and a half, shut key districts. Many dressed in white -- the official color for the march -- and held red placards calling for the extradition bill to be withdrawn and for Ms. Lam to step down.
It follows weeks of growing disquiet from a cross-section of society: petitions were circulated online by local schools, homemakers and churches; antiextradition law banners unfurled at local universities; and 3,000 lawyers staged a silent protest march.
Crowds were so massive that some train stations across the city were temporarily closed and protesters had to line up on hot streets to enter a local park. They chanted slogans to oppose the law and cheered each other on as they expressed their discontent.
""I needed to let my voice be heard,"" said Kitty Wong, a 38-year-old teacher who, like many demonstrators, was joining a protest for the first time. Gesturing to her two children, ages 8 and 9, she said: ""We need to defend our home for the next generation.""
Veteran democracy activist Martin Lee called Sunday's rally the ""last fight"" for Hong Kong. Mr. Lee was on the drafting committee of the Basic Law, the city's mini constitution that enshrined people's freedoms and rights until 2047. He said there was deliberately no extradition clause in that agreement because the two jurisdictions were too different. Under the new law, Beijing could extradite Hong Kong residents and foreigners on trumped-up charges, he said.
""I don't think this will change anything, but you have to try,"" said Hong Chan, a 27-year-old protester in Hong Kong.
""Even if the chance of a withdrawal is 50-50, we decided to come out today because it was the right thing to do,"" said Jason Y. Ng, convener of the Progressive Lawyers Group.
Others were more bullish. ""In the face of such overwhelming opposition to the bill, the government will be taking a big risk to pass it,"" said Margaret Ng, a lawyer and former legislator. ""If they decide to ram it down people's throats, they will lose all legitimacy.""

World News: China Says It Holds Consulate Employee,"BEIJING -- China confirmed that mainland police have detained an employee of the British Consulate in Hong Kong for allegedly violating Chinese law, in Beijing's first official comment on the man's case since he disappeared two weeks ago.
Simon Cheng, a Hong Kong citizen, had been given the punishment of 15 days in ""administrative detention"" by police in the city of Shenzhen, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Wednesday.
Mr. Cheng had allegedly violated China's Public-Security Administration Punishments Law, according to the ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, who didn't specify the alleged wrongdoing.
The law covers a range of offenses deemed detrimental to public order but minor enough to be punished with fines or short-term detention -- such as damaging public property and spreading rumors.
Mr. Cheng, a trade and investment officer with the British Consulate General in Hong Kong, had disappeared late on Aug. 8 at a border check on his way home from Shenzhen, according to his girlfriend.
Mr. Geng didn't say when Mr. Cheng was first detained or when he would be released.
It couldn't be determined whether Mr. Cheng's detention was related to the continuing antigovernment protests in Hong Kong against Beijing's increasing encroachment on the partly autonomous city.
""This employee is a Hong Kong citizen, he isn't a British citizen,"" Mr. Geng said of Mr. Cheng. ""He is a Chinese person, in other words. So this is completely an internal matter for China.""

Disney Thrives at Box Office But Focus Turns to Streaming,"Walt Disney Co.'s hit movies, led by ""The Lion King"" and ""Toy Story 4,"" once again helped drive strong quarterly results. But the company is largely looking beyond the theater for its future, focusing instead on reasons for folks to stay home.
Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger has spent billions of dollars buying franchises, from the Avengers to Star Wars -- brands that will soon be put to the test when Disney launches Disney+, its putative streaming rival to Netflix Inc.
""We're making a huge statement about the future of media and entertainment,"" Mr. Iger said on a conference call with Wall Street analysts Thursday.
Highlighting the company's dueling priorities, Disney's theatrical-movie division posted a 52% rise in revenue and 79% jump in operating income in the three months ended Sept. 28.
Overall, Disney's profit slumped by more than half to $1.05 billion, hurt by a sharp rise in costs stemming in part from the Disney+ production costs. But its shares rose in after-hours trading as earnings beat analysts' expectations.
Despite the company's box-office riches, a streaming-first mentality now pervades the company, if Mr. Iger's remarks were any indication. Disney's film and television divisions are producing hundreds of hours of programming not only for Disney+ but also a 19-month-old ESPN streaming service and Hulu, a third service that Disney now controls after its $71.3 billion acquisition of the 21st Century Fox entertainment assets.
A team of newly hired engineers have built out an interface and technical underpinning to withstand millions of subscribers. Former partners like Amazon.com Inc. are now streaming rivals, forcing Disney to negotiate deals to get its service onto as many platforms as possible.
In trying to turn every home into a Mouse House, Disney's streaming launch is a long-game attempt to allay concerns Wall Street began expressing in 2015 when Mr. Iger acknowledged subscriber losses at ESPN, the company's most profitable division. The prospect of long-term decline at the cable sports network delivered a shock to Disney's share price, since investors focused on the company's vulnerability to Netflix despite record-setting performances at the box office and in theme parks.
Disney is preparing a trio of streaming services to appeal to more than its core family demographic; and no deal was more instrumental to the strategy than its absorption of Fox. The integration of those assets continued on Thursday when Mr. Iger announced that Fox's FX network will begin producing programming for Hulu.
Hulu will become the service where Disney sends its more mature shows and movies. Episodes from original FX shows will be available on Hulu one day after they premiere, including new shows from ""Ex Machina"" director Alex Garland and another starring Cate Blanchett. Other Fox brands like Fox Searchlight, the studio label behind Oscar winners like ""The Shape of Water,"" will also develop shows and movies for the service.
The ESPN streaming service and Hulu will be sold as a bundled collection for $12.99 a month.
Disney seems to be borrowing elements of Netflix's playbook for Disney+. The service will allow users to download shows and movies for later viewing, and multiple user accounts are to be permitted on each household subscription.
But Disney is also diverging in significant ways. All Disney+ programming will be family-friendly, and episodes will premiere one at a time, more akin to traditional broadcast or cable television than to Netflix's binge-it-all approach. Mr. Iger has also said he wants Disney+ to have a user interface that feels more personally tailored than Netflix's algorithm-driven model.
Industry insiders expect Disney+, which will cost $6.99 a month, to siphon some users from Netflix, whose most popular offering goes for $12.99. Netflix in October missed its subscriber-growth target in the U.S. and overseas for a second consecutive quarter.
Netflix lost domestic subscribers for the first time in nearly a decade two quarters ago, and in its latest quarter added 517,000 stateside users -- short of its expectation of 800,000.
By getting into streaming, Disney has gone from a company that provided other platforms -- including Netflix -- with marquee entertainment, into a rival competing for subscribers.
The awkwardness was highlighted last month in a recent dispute with Amazon over terms to carry Disney apps on Fire TV devices. Mr. Iger said Thursday that the two companies had reached a deal to carry Disney+ on the Amazon devices when it launches next week.
That is a significant gain for Disney+, since Amazon had 29% of the U.S. market for streaming-media boxes in the second quarter, according to Strategy Analytics, behind only rival Roku Inc.
Subscribers on Tuesday will see a combination of classic Disney programming coming out of ""the vault,"" including older movies like ""Swiss Family Robinson"" or ""The Little Mermaid."" That fare will be combined with newer releases from Marvel Studios and original programming based on some of Disney's most popular franchises, like the Star Wars spinoff ""The Mandalorian"" and a new series based on the 2006 made-for-television movie ""High School Musical.""
Star Wars is yet another example of a franchise divided by Disney's streaming strategy. While ""The Mandalorian"" is the most notable original offering on Disney+, the theatrical releases of the franchise will go on ""a bit of a hiatus"" following the December release of ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,"" Mr. Iger said, acknowledging the struggle some of the Star Wars titles have had at the theatrical box office.
Disney's total revenue increased to $19.1 billion, slightly missing analysts' consensus estimate. Revenue jumped 22% to $6.5 billion at the company's media networks, which include ESPN, and 52% to $3.3 billion at its studio entertainment division.
Excluding certain items, earnings were $1.07 a share, higher than the 94 cents a share expected by analysts polled by FactSet.
Depressed tourism in Hong Kong, driven by the anti-China protests that have filled the city's streets in recent months, led to a significant decline in attendance at Hong Kong Disneyland. If current trends hold, the location could post an operating-income decline of $275 million in the current fiscal year, compared with just-ended fiscal 2019, said Disney finance chief Christine McCarthy.

World News: Trump Ties China Trade Deal to Hong Kong --- President says Beijing must react 'humanely' to protests amid worries over intervention,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump suggested a ""personal meeting"" with China's President Xi Jinping to discuss the escalating crisis in Hong Kong and warned China it must respond ""humanely"" to the protests if it wants to strike a trade deal.
Mr. Trump's statement on Twitter marked a shift in tone in his public statements regarding the situation in Hong Kong and for the first time linked the administration's fragile trade talks with Beijing to the protests. The Wednesday evening tweets came amid growing concern within the administration that China would respond with military force to the antigovernment protests that have shut down Hong Kong's major international airport for the past two days.
Fears over a potentially violent crackdown have sparked concern among lawmakers from both parties, some of whom have been unequivocal in their support for the protesters.
""I know President Xi of China very well,"" Mr. Trump said. ""He is a great leader who very much has the respect of his people. He is also a good man in a 'tough business.' I have ZERO doubt that if President Xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem, he can do it.""
The president concluded, ""Personal meeting?""
In recent weeks, the administration has quietly urged U.S. officials to maintain a measured response on Hong Kong over fears that public criticism of Beijing could derail U.S.-China trade talks, two senior administration officials have said.
Mr. Trump himself has called for a restrained response to the protests to avoid rousing tensions with Beijing, the officials said.
On Tuesday, Mr. Trump described the Hong Kong crisis only as a ""tricky situation."" Then on Wednesday morning, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross denied that trade negotiations with Beijing were tempering the administration's response to Hong Kong.
""I don't know if we would have done anything different in the past. What would we do? Invade Hong Kong?"" Mr. Ross said on CNBC. ""The president has made clear that he is watching very carefully what's happening. . . This is an internal matter.""
Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump began a series of tweets with reassurances to U.S. consumers that his trade war with China wouldn't affect them adversely. He then made a rare unsolicited mention of Hong Kong.
""It actually helps China more than us, but will be reciprocated,"" he wrote. ""Millions of jobs are being lost in China to other non-Tariffed countries. Thousands of companies are leaving. Of course China wants to make a deal. Let them work humanely with Hong Kong first!""
The U.S.-China trade fight and the Hong Kong crisis are overlapping in Washington as more American lawmakers voice concerns over Beijing's policy toward Hong Kong.
Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), in a tweet Wednesday, described Beijing's stance on Hong Kong as ""a cautionary lesson for anyone thinking about any deal with them.""
Mr. Rubio has introduced a bipartisan bill that threatens to revoke Hong Kong's special trade status with the U.S. if Beijing intervenes in the city, which is a vital trade gateway with the West for China.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), in a tweet of support for the protests on Tuesday, referenced the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing, where soldiers killed hundreds of unarmed protesters.
""30 years after Tiananmen Square all Americans stand with the peaceful protesters in Hong Kong,"" Mr. Graham wrote. Tiananmen Square remains a sensitive issue in China, where any mention or remembrances of the crackdown are censored.
""These protests highlight the moral authority of their demands for Freedom and Democracy. This is becoming a defining moment for US-China relations,"" Mr. Graham wrote.
Several Democrats had criticized Mr. Trump for not taking a more forceful stance in support of the pro-democracy protesters.
""If America does not speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interests, we lose all moral authority to speak out elsewhere,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said Tuesday night.
Beijing has reacted angrily to U.S. lawmakers' comments, citing them as further evidence of American involvement in China's internal affairs and saying that the lawmakers ""whitewashed violent crimes as a struggle for human rights and freedom.""
""Hong Kong affairs are entirely China's internal affairs, and you are neither entitled nor qualified to wantonly comment on them,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters this week during a regularly scheduled news conference.

World News: Hong Kong Police Fire at Demonstrators,"Police fired at protesters, leaving one person undergoing emergency surgery, as the city's Monday morning commute descended into turmoil after protesters tried to block roads and subways amid calls for a general strike.
In a video circulating on social media, a police officer was seen firing three shots toward protesters, hitting at least one in the body from close range, at a road intersection in eastern Hong Kong island. A 21-year-old man was undergoing an operation at a nearby hospital, according to the Hospital Authority, which declined to provide further details on his condition.
Monday's clashes created confusion for the city's commuters heading to work or school. Many were left stranded at Hong Kong's subway stations, while several universities canceled classes for the day.
Protests now in their sixth month have shown no signs of abating even after the government withdrew an extradition bill that sparked the original unrest. Weekend clashes are commonplace as many young black-clad and masked protesters target their anger at police, whom they accuse of using excessive force to put down protests.
The shooting is likely to put further pressure on the government to consider protesters' demands for a new independent investigation into police conduct as well as deepen the divide between Hong Kong's residents and authorities.
The scuffles on Monday morning came after another weekend of clashes between the police and protests across town, with scenes in many districts of residents turning out to shout abuse at police as they fired tear gas and made arrests across the city.
Peaceful vigils were also held throughout the weekend for a student who died Friday morning from head injuries sustained in a fall at a car park in the early hours of last Monday while police were using tear gas in a nearby dispersal operation.
Monday's shooting was the third live-fire incident that injured protesters. On Oct. 1, National Day, an 18-year-old schoolboy was shot in the chest by a riot police officer in Tsuen Wan, while he was among a group trying to attack another officer. Three days later, a 14-year-old boy was shot in the left thigh by a plainclothes officer who was surrounded by protesters.
At the scene of Monday morning's shooting, a uniformed policeman drew his pistol with one hand and grabbed a protester with the other, the video online showed. Another protester wearing black approached the policeman, and the officer fired at him. The protester fell to the ground immediately, clutching the right side of his stomach. The officer then fired two more rounds in the direction of other protesters, but hospital officials didn't comment on whether a second person had been shot and injured.
Early Monday, protesters set up barricades at several transportation avenues around the city, including two road tunnels, according to the police. Over a dozen locations were targeted to be barricaded by protesters, according to footage and digital posters circulating online.
Police responded in some areas by firing tear gas. Some commuters were caught in the middle in the district of Tseung Kwan O, where the man last week died after the car park fall, and were treated by people appearing to be first-aid workers carrying water and saline solution.
Hong Kong police said they had opened fire early morning at the eastern district on Hong Kong island without giving details. Earlier, the police issued a statement calling on protesters to stop obstructing traffic.
On Friday and Saturday, seven Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmakers were either arrested or received notice of pending arrest in an action criticized as a government clampdown on the opposition ahead of local elections scheduled for this month.
Lawmakers Eddie Chu Hoi-dick, Raymond Chan Chi-chuen and Au Nok-hin were charged for breaching the Legislative Council Ordinance, Hong Kong police said. The arrests relate to scuffles in a Legislative Council meeting about six months ago. That was when rival camps of pro-democracy and pro-establishment lawmakers competed to hold their own version of a committee to vet an extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be tried in mainland China's more-opaque judicial system.

China's Hong Kong Crisis,"American elites not too long ago spoke admiringly of the efficiency of China's one-party state. Well, how do you like it now? We're referring to the escalating protests and violence in Hong Kong, which are the result of an historic miscalculation by Chinese President Xi Jinping.
This week police shot a young Hong Kong protester at close range, while a man arguing with protesters was set on fire. Protests typically limited to the weekend are now disrupting the workweek and commerce that is the lifeblood of that great trading city. Between Nov. 8 and 14, Hong Kong hospitals admitted at least 340 people with protest-related injuries.
This is what happens when an authoritarian government tries to take away freedoms that Hong Kongers have enjoyed. Mr. Xi now faces the greatest challenge to Communist rule since the democracy uprising of 1989.
The smart play would be for Mr. Xi to admit his mistake in trying to impose new and repressive laws on the territory and honor China's promise of autonomy for Hong Kong through 2047. The protests might calm down and world attention move elsewhere.
But China's Communists fear that any accommodation to Hong Kong could unleash democratic demands on the Mainland too. So they are reinforcing their attempts at control, which leads to more protests, then more arrests, and the cycle continues. Police now routinely deny permits for protests, leaving few legal means for Hong Kongers to express their anger.
The Communist Party's elite met in late October and emerged with a new plan to integrate Hong Kong with the Mainland. It includes calls for Hong Kong to pass national-security legislation, which democracy activists fear would criminalize dissent as treason or sedition. Longer term, the Party wants to change the freedom-loving views of Hong Kong's young people by imposing ""patriotic education"" in the schools.
Beijing's factotums in Hong Kong may also use the disorder as a pretext to block district council elections scheduled for Nov. 24. The council's power is mainly symbolic, but voters have broken records in their rush to register, and Beijing fears its candidates are in for a trouncing.
Officials have disqualified democracy advocate Joshua Wong from running, and the state-run People's Daily said this week that ""only by supporting the police force to decisively put down the riots can a peaceful environment be restored and fair elections be held.""
Hong Kong needs the support of the world, especially the U.S. The House has already passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, and the Senate is expected to pass it as early as Friday. The legislation would require the Secretary of State to certify each year that Hong Kong still merits special treatment under U.S. law. If the answer is no, the President could strip Hong Kong of privileges on trade and customs, aviation and banking cooperation and more.
The bill would also allow sanctions on Chinese or Hong Kong officials who participate in arbitrary detentions or rendition to China or commit human-rights abuses. Overall, it would raise the price for China's failure to honor its international agreement under the Sino-British Joint Declaration.
As for the allure of efficient authoritarianism, Hong Kong's brave stand for freedom is the real example Americans should admire."
"World News: Civil Servants Join Hong Kong Protests --- Government workers, angered at officials' handling of unrest, turn out for rare protest","HONG KONG -- A contentious extradition bill, the police's handling of weekslong protests and city officials' limited response to the public's concerns have provoked a rare wave of dissent from within the government's own ranks -- civil servants, who are supposed to maintain political neutrality.
Government employees gathered at a two-hour rally Friday evening, a show of resistance as Hong Kong's political crisis -- now in its eighth week -- attracts a growing chorus of criticism centered on the way authorities have handled the unrest.
Thousands of people, including members of the general public who chanted support, turned out at the event, including many civil servants who defied warnings by the government that employees who participate would violate their terms of employment and face consequences.
Former Chief Secretary Anson Chan, once the city's No. 2 official, spoke to the crowds at the rally, saying that she admired their spirit.
""Despite of the government's statement, which sounds intimating, you still take your courage out to stand with the citizens along with your conscience,"" said Mrs. Chan, who worked for the government for 39 years.
The protest follows an anonymous open letter from employees to the leader of the semiautonomous Chinese city, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, herself a career civil servant for nearly four decades.
""We are extremely ashamed of what the government is doing as fellow public officials,"" they wrote in the letter, which was accompanied by images of more than a hundred employee badges with their individual identities obscured. The letter was posted on the Reddit-like social news website LIHKG, which is popular among activists.
The challenge to Mrs. Lam's leadership is seen as a sign of how deeply resentment has become rooted throughout society since she attempted to introduce a bill allowing extradition to mainland China, a proposal Mrs. Lam later suspended but has refused to withdraw. Broader protests are planned through this weekend, with demonstrators calling for a general strike Monday.
The planned rallies come as pressure mounts on Mrs. Lam to calm the unrest, which has become more violent with each passing week. Beijing has publicly backed the city's government and an increasingly aggressive approach by police to clear demonstrators from the streets.
In Hong Kong, government jobs -- known for their stability, guaranteed benefits and relatively good pay -- are coveted and referred to as ""iron rice bowls.""
More than 180,000 people are employed in the civil service, from prison guards and food inspectors to firefighters and air-traffic controllers, according to the government's website.
Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, the city's No. 2 ranking official, spoke to local media Friday morning, saying ""there's no problem"" if an off-duty government employee wants to participate the rally as a citizen, but he or she ""can't do things against the government's stance in the name of public servants.""
The Civil Service Bureau's code of conduct says civil servants ""shall serve the chief executive and the government of the day with total loyalty and to the best of their ability, no matter what their own political beliefs are.""
""Any acts to undermine the principle of political neutrality of the civil service are totally unacceptable,"" a Hong Kong government representative said in a news release Thursday, adding that it would ""follow up"" on any violations of regulations. The government has been listening to the views of colleagues through internal channels, according to the statement.
On Thursday, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and other lawmakers wrote a letter to President Trump urging him to condemn China's efforts to undermine Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy.
The letter came after the Trump administration offered guidance to officials to maintain a measured response to the protests in the city over fears that any public statements favoring the demonstrators would derail U.S. efforts to reach a trade deal with China.

World News: Protests Lead Lebanon Premier to Resign,"BEIRUT -- Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced his resignation after nearly two weeks of nationwide protests, triggered in part by a currency crisis and struggling economy.
In a live television address on Tuesday, Mr. Hariri said he would step aside after his attempts to address demands for economic overhauls failed to tamp down calls for the entire government to resign.
""I have hit a dead end, I need to create a big shock to move the situation,"" he said before heading to the Presidential Palace to formally submit his resignation.
The move sets the stage for a new era of political uncertainty in Lebanon. President Michel Aoun could reject Mr. Hariri's resignation as prime minister and ask him to form a new cabinet, or designate him as head of a caretaker government with limited powers. He also could opt to call fresh elections.
The spark for Lebanon's protests was something small -- a $6 monthly tax on WhatsApp, the popular messaging app. The tax was designed to shore up revenue in accordance with the requirements set by international donors.
Protesters interpreted the tax, which was quickly shelved, as emblematic of the economic mismanagement that had driven the country into a steady decline. It also came amid frustration this month with the government's inability to contain its biggest wildfires in decades, which spread through Lebanon's Chouf Mountains.
Early impromptu protests, including a few nights of smashing windows and burning tires, quickly evolved into nationwide celebrations that brought together demonstrators from across the political spectrum. Many waved Lebanon's flag instead of those of rival political parties.
It was unclear whether Mr. Hariri's move would be enough to halt the nationwide protests, which have been driven by popular concerns that defy easy solution. The country is suffering from a shortage of U.S. dollars and electricity and water shortfalls, exacerbated by an influx of Syrian refugees.
Protesters are also calling for an end to corruption and the country's sectarian system of governance, in place since the end of a civil war in 1990, which divides posts among Christian, Sunni and Shiite Muslim leaders. There were no signs that system was likely to change.
The latest protests echo popular uprisings in recent months, in which smaller grievances sparked broader demands. In Hong Kong, opposition to a proposed extradition law that would have allowed people in the city to be tried in mainland China grew into wider democracy protests. In Chile, an outcry against a subway-fare increase has morphed into mass protests about an array of grievances.
Meanwhile, tens of thousands of protesters from Cairo to Baghdad took to the streets in recent months. Demonstrations echoed those of the so-called Arab Spring in 2011, when a mostly young population revolted against corruption, poor governance and the lack of economic opportunities.
Mr. Hariri, the son of a popular former prime minister killed by a car bomb in 2005, also resigned in 2017 under pressure from Saudi Arabia. He eventually returned to Lebanon, where he became known as the country's main interlocutor with the West. He had been working to push through overhauls that would have unlocked billions of dollars in loans from the World Bank, Saudi Arabia and others.
But he struggled to contain the street protests, which swelled over the past two weeks to include more than a million Lebanese.
While recent antigovernment protests in Iraq and Egypt have at times descended into deadly violence, Lebanon's demonstrations have largely been peaceful. In addition to decrying political dysfunction and economic malaise, many protesters say the country's leaders put the interests of regional powers before those of their own country.
""This is a stunning short-term success for the protest movement,"" said Anthony Elghossian, a Beirut-based Lebanese-American attorney and nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council. ""But they need to see if they can sustain this change.""

Hong Kong's Spiritual Battle,"Hong Kong -- A young protester here faced a moral dilemma: As a Christian, he felt violence was wrong. He also felt a duty to fight back against an oppressive government. ""Can I throw bricks?"" he asked Pastor Daniel Chan.
The protests in Hong Kong are entering their 20th consecutive weekend, and millions have peacefully taken to the streets to defend the city's legal autonomy. Police have responded violently, and a small but growing number of protesters are convinced that peaceful dissent won't deliver results. Hong Kong's pastors are in the spiritual trenches of this increasingly bloody fight.
Hong Kong's more than one million Christians are divided between the ""blue"" pro-government camp and the ""yellow"" opposition. Both sides vent their fears and frustrations to church leaders, who are trying to keep their congregations together.
Most young churchgoers support the pro-democracy protests, several pastors told me. They believe Christians have a moral obligation to oppose injustice, Pastor Mike Ng said, but they're struggling to discern whether civil disobedience and defensive violence are justifiable. ""We cannot give them very insightful or comprehensive answers,"" the pastor admitted. ""Even for myself, I cannot be satisfied.""
It makes sense that many Christians would be sympathetic to the protesters, given the Chinese Communist Party's history. Mao Zedong wanted to eradicate religion. Christians got some respite from Deng Xiaoping, who ruled from 1978-92 and allowed religious practice, albeit under heavy control. But a new crackdown began when Xi Jinping assumed office in 2013. The government has imprisoned pastors, torn down churches, and in some cases replaced images of Jesus with portraits of Mr. Xi.
Yet many older churchgoers oppose the protests and remain loyal to Beijing, according to several pastors. Some think ""the Bible teaches us to be obedient,"" even to imperfect governments, Mr. Chan said. Others grew up poor in the mainland and take pride in China's prosperity and growing prominence, which they attribute to the Communist Party.
""The first and foremost factor or element is stability,"" Mr. Ng said. The over-40 group wants to safeguard their economic status and religious freedom. They fear increased persecution if the church supports protests.
These divisions make it tough to preach. If a sermon is too political, pro-government congregants complain that ""we want a message that can soothe our hearts instead of tell us what the government has done wrong,"" Mr. Ng said. He decided to back off politics ""to embrace the weakness of these Christians, even if I don't agree with them."" Two pastors told me they've conducted separate Bible studies in person or via WhatsApp for believers on each political side so they can focus on the distinct spiritual needs of both camps.
This hasn't satisfied everyone. Political drama has now become family drama, said Pastor Timmy Lee. The most intense protests typically have taken place on weekend nights, bookending Sunday services. ""Many parents are so concerned about the safety of their kids,"" Mr. Lee said. ""They hold very strong views about their kids not going out."" The young protest anyway, and church leaders often become intermediaries between parents and children.
At a church service in September, Pastor Winky Wong reassured congregants that God is in control, even if Hong Kong feels out of control. Political divisions existed even among the Twelve Disciples, she noted: Matthew was a former tax collector, while Simon Peter was a firebrand who cut off someone's ear when the authorities came to arrest Jesus. But she said the Bible teaches that in times of difficulty, believers should trust God and pray for their enemies -- whether they're in the police department or one's own household.
Even among pastors, the political crisis has awakened anxieties about the future of Christianity in Hong Kong. Under the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Chinese government agreed to preserve Hong Kong's religious freedom, and so far it has kept that promise. But the treaty expires in 2047, and China's recent encroachments have made some here fearful that their freedoms will slip away even sooner.
""It's hard to imagine 30 years later because we can't imagine what's tomorrow,"" Mr. Chan said. His goal is to mold his congregants ""into true Christians to face the unforeseeable future."" In times of persecution, the Chinese church has gone underground, meeting in small groups. ""The concept is there already,"" Mr. Ng observed. One pastor can supervise a cluster of church cells, so ""we don't need many trained pastors -- we need trained small-group leaders,"" Mr. Lee said. Today's protester may be tomorrow's house-church leader.

World News: Protesters Press On in Hong Kong --- Demonstrators take to streets in defiance of police ban; some violence breaks out,"HONG KONG -- Political turmoil engulfing this global financial center showed no sign of abating as tens of thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators marched Sunday in defiance of a police ban, with many venting their anger at Beijing just two weeks before China celebrates the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic.
People of all ages -- many unmasked and some carrying children -- joined a peaceful march over a roughly two-mile stretch of downtown Hong Kong, shouting slogans calling for freedom and revolution, waving placards to call for greater democratic rights and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality.
Events turned violent toward the evening as black-clad protesters hurled bricks and Molotov cocktails toward the government headquarters and at lines of riot police, who responded by firing tear gas and a water cannon. Police later chased protesters down streets and made arrests as clashes continued into the night, with fights between groups of protesters and government supporters.
The scale of the crowds was at times similar to that of mass marches earlier this summer triggered by a proposed law that would have allowed extradition to mainland China. The turnout showed that the recent pledge by Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, to withdraw an unpopular extradition bill that sparked the unrest hasn't blunted a broad-based opposition movement against Beijing's growing influence over the former British colony.
Anti-China sentiment permeated Sunday's protests, during which demonstrators vandalized facades of mainland Chinese-run businesses and spray-painted anti-China slogans along the route of the march. At one point along the route, small Chinese flags were scattered on the ground to be trampled. Many protesters carried signs on which the yellow stars on China's flag were rearranged to form a swastika.
""We are here to tell the world that we are standing for freedom and we are not afraid,"" said a 25-year-old protester named Jessica, who held one of the swastika signs. ""We are standing at the front lines against the authoritarian regime"" of China's Communist Party.
The 15th straight weekend of protests adds pressure on the Hong Kong government to do more to curb the unrest, potentially by invoking emergency powers, and minimize the embarrassment for Beijing as it celebrates the 70th anniversary of Communist rule in China. Chinese officials have publicly backed Mrs. Lam, who said Sept. 4 that her government would formally withdraw an extradition bill that sparked the summer of unrest and would start a public dialogue to repair rifts in society.
She also appealed for society to condemn more radical protests, trying to drive a wedge between peaceful opponents and a hard-core minority that favors violent tactics. Many who marched peacefully Sunday, though, said they dismissed Mrs. Lam's appeals and condemned the government and police.
""We need to stand here, we need to walk here. We need to tell government, we need five demands, not one less,"" said Charis, 30, who had her 7-month-old daughter strapped to her front. ""We hope our children have a future, because now in Hong Kong, we cannot see any hope.""
The five demands issued by the protest movement include an inquiry into allegations of police brutality, amnesty for arrested protesters and electoral reforms to allow Hong Kongers to vote for their leaders. Mrs. Lam has acceded to just one -- the withdrawal of the bill that would have allowed people to be sent for trial in China -- and has repeatedly ruled out a new inquiry into police actions.
The Chinese government didn't issue any immediate comment on Sunday's protests. Mainland experts say Beijing would still back Hong Kong authorities to take the lead in quelling the unrest, though pressure is mounting for them to use more decisive measures.
""The radical protesters have now shown themselves to be the enemies of Hong Kong and its rule of law,"" said Tian Feilong, an associate law professor at Beihang University in Beijing. ""The Hong Kong government has to seriously consider employing emergency powers, so as to give the police the necessary muscle for dealing with the violent protesters.""

"World News: China's Ruling Party Strongly Backs Xi --- Communist conclave endorses president despite economic woes, trade war and unrest","Chinese President Xi Jinping emerged from a Communist Party conclave with a resolute endorsement of his leadership, despite a slowing economy, a bruising trade war with the U.S. and unrest in Hong Kong.
The party's governing Central Committee also signaled a firmer stance on Hong Kong, calling for stronger safeguards for China's national security in the city -- a formulation that some experts say foreshadows new legal powers to squelch dissent against Beijing's authority.
The statements came in a communique issued on Thursday after the close of a four-day meeting in Beijing, a roughly annual gathering of about 370 top party officials.
This year's conclave came during an especially trying period for Mr. Xi, whose domineering leadership style and assertive diplomacy has drawn criticism from within the Beijing elite. Some party members and policy specialists have blamed him for concentrating too much power in his own hands, exacerbating tensions with Washington, mismanaging the domestic economy and sowing confusion in the bureaucracy with his insistence on control and his threats to punish wayward officials.
Recounting his signature policies over the past seven years, the communique praised Mr. Xi for delivering ""important progress"" in China's development amid an increasingly complex global environment and called on the party to stay the course with his policies.
The word ""persevere"" appeared 57 times in the document, chiefly in exhortations for commitment to Mr. Xi's edicts on matters including political discipline, economic overhauls, poverty relief and environmental protection.
""The message from the meeting was clear: The world is becoming more complex, and so we need more party control,"" said Jude Blanchette, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
In language consistent with a declaration from a similar conclave last year, where the party elite backed Mr. Xi's bid to scrap term limits on his presidency, Thursday's communique urged the party and the nation to ""unite even more closely"" around Mr. Xi's leadership.
Rather than chart new policies, the goal of this year's meeting appears to have been providing ""affirmation of Xi's brand of personalized authoritarianism and his approach to governance,"" said Wu Qiang, a Beijing-based commentator on Chinese politics and a former political-science lecturer at Tsinghua University.
In the communique, the party signaled no compromise on its approach to governing Hong Kong, where massive protests have flared since June in a broad denouncing of Beijing's increased influence in the territory.
Reaffirming the ""one country, two systems"" framework that Beijing uses to administer the former British colony, the Communist Party's Central Committee agreed to ""establish and perfect the legal framework and implementation mechanisms for safeguarding national security in special administrative regions,"" a reference to Hong Kong and the former Portuguese colony of Macau.
Some experts believe this phrasing indicates that Beijing wants to revive efforts to introduce national security legislation in Hong Kong; a previous bid to do that collapsed in 2003 after mass protests.
The unrest in Hong Kong has prompted soul-searching among Chinese officials, some of whom believe Beijing must do more to integrate the city with the mainland, people who spoke to these officials said.
This week's party conclave, known as a plenum, followed an unusually long gap since the prior one, held in early 2018. The 20-month interval was the longest since the early 1970s.
""Xi clearly emerged from the meeting unscathed, which should put to bed -- for now at least -- speculation that he's facing a concerted leadership challenge,"" Mr. Blanchette said.

EXCHANGE --- Business & Finance News: Cathay Puts Bond Sale on Ice After Lukewarm Reception,"Hong Kong's flagship carrier Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. shelved plans to sell its first U.S. dollar bonds in more than two decades after receiving lukewarm interest from potential investors, according to people familiar with the matter.
The airline has struggled with steep declines in passenger numbers in recent months and was embroiled in controversy after some of its employees took part in antigovernment protests in Hong Kong. Those actions drew criticism from Chinese authorities and threats to boycott its flights from Chinese businesses, prompting Cathay to fire dozens of employees and replace both its chief executive officer and chairman.
Cathay recently raised 800 million Hong Kong dollars ($102 million) via a private placement of three-year bonds denominated in the city's local currency. The company said it would continue to monitor the U.S. dollar bond market.
In late September, representatives for the airline had met with bond investors in Hong Kong and Singapore to drum up enthusiasm ahead of a dollar bond sale. Cathay also tapped four large investment banks to help coordinate a deal, according to a document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
Declines in U.S. Treasury yields this year have made dollar bond funding an attractive option for many companies.
On Friday, the airline said the number of passengers it carried in September fell 7.1% from a year ago, and it expects a significant decline in bookings on flights into Hong Kong for the remainder of 2019.
Cathay's mainland China business ""has been hit especially hard,"" and the rest of the year ""will remain incredibly challenging for the airline,"" its chief customer and commercial officer, Ronald Lam, said.

World News: University Campus Turns Into Battleground,"HONG KONG -- It took Dr. Chu longer than usual to administer stitches to his patient: a young student protester who had hobbled into a makeshift clinic set up inside a gym at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
Surrounded by gym mats that marked different treatment stations, Dr. Chu's patient sat crouched, hugging her knees to bear the pain of a cut to her head sustained from a flying tear-gas canister during clashes with police outside. The doctor gave her four head stitches, without anesthesia, by the light of a flashlight held by a first-aid volunteer.
Dozens of injured protesters visited the clinic at the Yeung Ming Biu sports center and other makeshift clinics on Tuesday with injuries suffered during a daylong defense of the campus that had temporarily come under siege from riot police, volunteers said.
Students erected barricades, set fires and hurled Molotov cocktails to prevent police from further entering the campus. In return, they were hit by waves of tear gas so thick it was hard to see or to breathe without a gas mask. Jets from a water cannon followed before police retreated before midnight, in one of the first negotiated cease-fires amid five months of protests here.
Around the sprawling campus, human chains of students and supporters, young and old, stretched for more than a mile. Into late Tuesday, they passed along supplies of water, food and saline solution to the makeshift clinic and front lines. By Wednesday, Chinese University was a well-stocked fortress.
The university has become the fiercest front line of violent citywide clashes between masked youths and police that paralyzed much of the city this week. It is also symbolic: A bronze statue of the Goddess of Democracy stands in the grounds, to remember those who perished in the 1989 massacre of protesting Chinese students around Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
While police had previously entered university campuses in recent months and always been met with fierce resistance, the clashes this time escalated amid growing tensions in the city.
Hong Kong's police said on Wednesday that they had the right to enter campuses if crimes were committed there. Officers were responding to violence and acting to ""disperse the mob,"" as protesters dropped objects from a bridge onto vehicles moving on a highway underneath, a police spokesman said.
Police raids on university campuses to make arrests have fueled student protests, along with anger over their tactics in fighting protesters on the streets.
Chinese University -- which has spawned Nobel Prize winners -- has been associated with student activism since its founding in 1963. ""Chinese University is an important symbol in Hong Kong for pushing for the development of democracy,"" said Richard Tsoi, an alumnus and organizer of the yearly Tiananmen remembrance vigil here. ""The police's raid of the campus is an affront to that safe space for freedoms it has stood for over the years.""
Tensions began to escalate on Monday, after protesters called a general strike and tried to disrupt morning commuters across the city, during which one man was shot and wounded by police not long after dawn broke. As protests continued Tuesday, riot police came deeper into the university's leafy campus -- which resembles a self-contained city built on a hill -- to take the bridge from which they said objects were being thrown.
Throughout the day, protesters erected barricades, built a wall of fire and even attempted to set a school bus on fire. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets in one of the most intense and sustained clashes.
After receiving stitches to her head wound, Dr. Chu's patient sat slumped on bleachers with bandages around her head. She said she was a student from a nearby community college and had come to support the university students.
""I thought CUHK would be safe,"" she said. ""People need to help each other at these protests. Today the police are at Chinese University. Tomorrow, they could be at my home.""

World News: Hong Kong Unrest Tests Police --- Protesters rail against officers' use of force while China presses for tougher action,"HONG KONG -- With Hong Kong's summer of unrest escalating, its police are in a bind. The local population increasingly accuses them of inflaming protester rage by using excessive force, while mainland Chinese authorities are exhorting them to get tougher.
It is a precarious spot for the 34,000-member Hong Kong Police Force. Police themselves have become targets, with some demonstrators gathering outside police stations and dwellings, throwing projectiles, lighting fires and smashing vehicles before clashing with riot squads.
Raising the stakes further are hints that China could deploy its military to restore order if officials in Beijing conclude local authorities can't handle a crisis spinning out of control -- a last resort that could threaten Hong Kong's special status as a free-market financial hub connecting China and the West.
""No one wins in all this. Not the police, not the protesters,"" a Hong Kong officer said during a lull battling a protest.
A dozen other exhausted officers sat on the ground nearby, drinking water and catching their breath. After a short break, they were back out in sweltering heat, marching protesters off the streets with riot shields and tear gas.
The force has become the most visible face of a local government that has remained largely offstage and emerged in recent weeks chiefly to admonish protesters and refuse any compromise.
Police officials are hosting daily news conferences, while the appearance on Monday of the city's Beijing-backed chief executive, Carrie Lam, was her first in nearly two weeks. S
Police spokesman Tse Chun-chung defended the use of tear gas to disperse a crowd that gathered the night before to protest an arrest. ""The police will stand their ground and perform their best to help Hong Kong get back on track,"" he said.
Hong Kong's police was remade in the 1970s from a force criticized for corruption to one built around the beat-cop civility of British ""Bobbies."" That reputation is getting eroded by its increasing use of force to combat protesters who have grown more aggressive.
Hong Kong's police said they have made nearly 600 arrests and fired more than 1,800 rounds of tear gas and at least 160 rubber bullets since the protests began in June. The smell of tear gas wafting in residential areas and videos of police clad in riot armor clubbing protesters have sparked accusations of excessive force by protesters and residents.
Antipolice anger surged last month after dozens of men with sticks burst into a subway station and injured some 45 people, including a pregnant woman. Police arrived around a half-hour after the first emergency calls.
Critics accused them of delaying their response to allow the gang to carry out the beatings. Police arrested several of the men days later and said some had links to Hong Kong's underworld of ""triad"" mafias.
Protesters now chant ""triads! triads!"" and ""corrupt cops"" when police appear.
Police officials defend their performance, deny using excessive force and reject condoning gang attacks on protesters. Officials said the delayed response reflected how the force has become stretched thin dealing with demonstrations.
Much of the local rage focuses on the police. After dark, the most hard-core demonstrators have started gathering outside police stations across the city of seven million, chanting and shining laser pointers in windows.
Tensions boil over, with demonstrators pelting the buildings with objects or starting fires and riot police confronting the protesters.

"EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: China Worries Cloak Burberry in Uncertainty --- Shares of the British luxury brand are overpriced, given the risks to the company's turnaround plan","[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
It isn't an easy time for companies that depend on selling expensive products to Chinese consumers.
Trench-coat maker Burberry is particularly exposed to the chill winds blowing from Asia, even by the China-centric standards of the European luxury sector. Chinese shoppers contribute roughly two-fifths of Burberry's revenue globally, and many of them buy their products in protest-ridden Hong Kong.
The stock was immune to investors' wider worries about China until this month, when the whole sector was hit by President Trump's announcement of a 10% tariff on an additional $300 billion of Chinese goods followed by China's decision to let its currency devalue. Even now, after a 10% fall in the month to date, Burberry stock appears expensive on 23 times expected earnings -- one-tenth above its five-year average.
The brand is a little over midway through a multiyear makeover. Last year Chief Executive Marco Gobbetti hired a new lead designer, Riccardo Tisci, best known for his work at Givenchy. The hope is that the new creative approach and a better handbag range -- a more lucrative category than clothing -- can lift Burberry's comparatively low 16% operating margin.
But investors have gotten carried away. Burberry's shares have recently been pricing in sales growth of 5% to 6% in the second half of the company's financial year, which runs through March, according to calculations by Bernstein. Meeting these high expectations will be tough. An immediate problem is weak spending in Hong Kong, where antigovernment demonstrations are stretching into their 10th week. A dozen or so boutiques in the city account for 6% of Burberry's revenue.
Moreover, the brand is more reliant on Asian spenders than its rivals. For the quarter through June, sales in Europe were driven by tourists rather than locals, while business in its Americas region was flat. As the brand is still removing products from less-salubrious department stores in the U.S., growth there should remain subdued. So while signs that Mr. Tisci's new collections are going down well with Chinese shoppers are positive, Burberry has little to fall back on if buyers tighten their belts.
Granted, China's luxury spenders have proven to be a resilient lot so far this year, despite the wider slowdown in consumer demand for mass-market goods like electronics in the Chinese market. But this could change as the weaker yuan makes European luxury goods more expensive. The current Sino-American trade tensions are unpredictable -- on Tuesday the U.S. delayed the introduction of its latest tariffs -- but at some point they seem likely to take a toll on the consumer confidence of China's elite.
Burberry's stock, which hit a record last month, is still priced as if Chinese shoppers could be taken for granted. Investors' optimism may have only just started to sour.

World News: Huawei Accuses U.S. of Menacing Its Employees,"Huawei Technologies Co. accused the U.S. of ""using every tool at its disposal"" to disrupt its business, including launching cyberattacks on its networks and using law enforcement to menace its employees.
The Chinese telecommunications giant said U.S. authorities have searched, detained and arrested Huawei employees and its business partners. It also said FBI agents have been sent to the homes of its workers to pressure them to collect information on behalf of the U.S.
Huawei's accusations describe a broad campaign by U.S. officials to stymie the company's business activities globally. It said U.S. tactics include visa denials, detaining shipments and the resurfacing of settled civil cases as criminal charges. Officials have even pretended to be Huawei employees to drum up charges against the company, it said, without providing details.
Huawei set out the allegations Tuesday in a press release in which it also denied stealing technology from Rui Oliveira, a Portuguese multimedia producer. The Wall Street Journal last week reported that U.S. prosecutors were investigating several new alleged instances of intellectual-property theft by Huawei, including claims by Mr. Oliveira that it stole smartphone-camera technology from him.
Huawei accused Mr. Oliveira of ""taking advantage of the current geopolitical situation.""
Jeffrey Wadsworth, Mr. Oliveira's attorney, said his client plans to respond to Huawei in court next week and declined to provide further comment.
Beijing is locked in a trade dispute with Washington, while also struggling to deal with protests in Hong Kong.
China's Foreign Ministry earlier this year characterized U.S. treatment of Huawei as ""economic bullying"" and an attempt to block China's rise. Meanwhile, the U.S. Justice Department has said China is implicated in more than 80% of the economic espionage claims that it has charged or prosecuted.
In addition to denying Mr. Oliveira's claims, Huawei leveled new accusations against the U.S. Among them, it said the U.S. was ""instructing law enforcement to threaten, menace, coerce, entice and incite both current and former Huawei employees to turn against the company and work for them.""
The Justice Department said it doesn't comment on specific investigations but said the investigative techniques it uses are lawful. A representative for the Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment.
Huawei's press release didn't provide specific evidence to back up its allegations. However, a person familiar with the matter said at least three employees from Huawei's U.S. office have been contacted by law-enforcement agencies since the beginning of 2019.
When looking into allegations of criminal misconduct at a company, it is common for FBI agents to visit current or former employees of the company at their homes in an effort to persuade them to cooperate in their investigation and obtain evidence.
The allegations Tuesday are the latest exchange in a fight between the U.S. and Huawei, the world's largest maker of telecommunications equipment and the No. 2 smartphone maker. The company has been fighting escalating actions by the U.S. over more than a year, including two criminal indictments and a campaign to pressure U.S. allies to avoid using Huawei gear in their 5G network rollouts.
In an appearance with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in Dublin Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence repeated the Trump administration's contention that Huawei gear poses a security threat.
""It is well known that Chinese law requires Chinese telecom companies to provide Beijing's vast security apparatus with access to any data that touches their network,"" Mr. Pence said.
The stakes are high for Huawei and other telecom-equipment vendors as countries around the world prepare to deploy 5G. The next generation of superfast networks is expected to bring connectivity to an array of new devices, but could also entail new vulnerabilities, according to security experts and government officials.
Huawei's contention that the U.S. is resurfacing civil cases is an apparent reference to an indictment issued by prosecutors in January, accusing Huawei of stealing smartphone-testing technology from former partner T-Mobile US Inc. The indictment arose out of a civil suit filed by T-Mobile that was resolved in 2017, with a jury finding Huawei liable for breach of contract and ordering it to pay $4.8 million to its former partner. The dispute with Mr. Oliveira is a continuing civil case.
Huawei in the past year has been taking a more aggressive posture in response to U.S. actions. In March, the company filed a lawsuit in Texas federal court challenging portions of a law blocking its gear from being used by the government or contractors. Also, its once-reclusive founder and former Chinese army officer, Ren Zhengfei, has given a series of interviews hitting back at the U.S.

World News: Hong Kong Leader Vows to Advance Law,"HONG KONG -- Opponents of a proposed law that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China called for strikes and further protests this week, after the city's leader and Beijing both signaled they would push ahead with the bill despite massive protests against it.
After the protests Sunday into Monday morning, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam on Monday said there was no reason to delay the bill as it is needed to plug loopholes in the city's law that prevents fugitives being sent for trial in some jurisdictions. She said the bill would go for a second reading in the city's legislature as planned on Wednesday.
Her decision represents ""total indifference to people's voices and is a provocation to all who opposed the bill,"" said Civil Human Rights Front, the organizers of Sunday's march. ""This also sets out a test to Hong Kong people to see the price we are prepared to pay to fight for our cause.""
A spokeswoman for the group said it was encouraging workers to take Wednesday off and gather outside the Legislative Council in protest.
On social media, anonymous fliers circulated calling for protesters to begin encircling the legislative council building Tuesday night and for a citywide strike on Wednesday to protest the reading. Calling for unauthorized protests can constitute a crime under Hong Kong's public order laws.
Michael Vidler, a human-rights lawyer, said by text that he would allow his dozen employees to ""act in accordance with their conscience"" on Wednesday and not go to work.
Sunday's march represented the strongest display of opposition in years to the government and the rising influence of Beijing in Hong Kong. It raises questions over the ability for Ms. Lam's administration to govern effectively if the bill is passed.
Critics have slammed the law for leaving residents, and even those passing through Hong Kong, vulnerable to China's more opaque judicial system and potential human-rights abuses.
After Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, Beijing guaranteed to uphold people's freedoms and the city's legal system until at least 2047 under the concept of ""one country, two systems."" In recent years, China's rising presence has raised concerns that Beijing is squeezing civil liberties.
Beijing backed Hong Kong's leader on Monday, with officials telling state media they supported her decision and attributing Sunday's mass protest to local dissidents colluding with foreign powers they didn't name.
""Some sides have been making irresponsible remarks"" about the proposed amendments, said a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman at a routine weekday briefing. ""We firmly oppose external intervention in Hong Kong's legislation.""
The firm line shows that Sunday's protest is unlikely to get Beijing to deviate from the uncompromising position President Xi Jinping has taken toward dissent in Hong Kong -- and elsewhere in China.
""Beijing will not budge,"" said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""The goal is to tell the Hong Kong people who's the big boss.""
For Mr. Xi, countenancing dissent in one part of China risks encouraging it in others and would leave him vulnerable to critics at home upset with his far-reaching corruption crackdown, a weakening national economy and an intensifying dispute with the U.S. over trade, technology and global influence.
The accusation that foreign forces are stoking Hong Kong's discontent is meant to point to the U.S., allowing Beijing to play to anti-American sentiment, according to Mr. Lam. ""Xi Jinping has every reason to hang tough"" on Hong Kong, he said, especially after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized the proposed extradition amendments last month as a threat to Hong Kong's rule of law.
The organizers of Sunday's rally estimated that 1.03 million people marched to oppose the bill, while Hong Kong police estimated there were at 240,000 at its peak.

World News: China Police Gather by Hong Kong --- Thousands of Beijing paramilitary personnel make show of force across bay from city,"SHENZHEN, China -- In recent days, thousands of young paramilitary police have moved into a sports stadium in a residential district of this southern Chinese border city -- a show of force to a restive Hong Kong less than 5 miles away.
According to local residents, units of China's People's Armed Police -- a paramilitary force trained to contain domestic disturbances like riots -- have been arriving by the truckload at the futuristic bay-side stadium, capacity 20,000, where they have been living and training in recent days.
The young police, some in camouflage fatigues and others in T-shirts and shorts, are easily visible in the stadium passageways, while their sound-offs in unison echo around a busy sports complex ringed by soccer pitches and nursery schools.
Widespread media coverage in China over the past few days has stirred fears in Hong Kong that mainland authorities are considering a military-type action, though unusual levels of publicity about the deployment in the country's tightly scripted media may also mean the effort is primarily about escalating already stark signals that Beijing is seriously concerned about the situation in Hong Kong.
President Trump said Thursday he was confident China could ""humanely solve the problem in Hong Kong,"" adding he was scheduled to speak soon with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
The Shenzhen Bay Sports Center where the police are stationed sits just across the water from Yuen Long and Tin Shui Wai, Hong Kong neighborhoods that have been racked by some of the most extreme violence seen during the monthslong protests gripping the wealthy Chinese territory.
Any type of military response would mark a dramatic escalation in the already-fragile situation in Hong Kong and risk fundamentally undermining the ""high degree of autonomy"" that Beijing promised the city for 50 years after its return to China in 1997, and which sustains the city's role as a financial center.
At a minimum, any intervention would stir memories of the military's brutal crackdown around Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June 1989 that left hundreds dead and cemented the government's reputation for intolerance to dissent.
Strict rules govern when Chinese forces can enter the territory, though it is unclear how they would apply to the paramilitary forces; Hong Kong's government has said it hasn't requested any intervention, a legal prerequisite for mainland involvement.
Senior Hong Kong police officials said Wednesday they could manage the protests on their own, denying any knowledge of a need for further reinforcements.
On Monday, Chinese state media posted video clips on social media of military vehicles rolling through Shenzhen, part of what it described as a series of large-scale drills.
Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of military intervention by Beijing, including a tweet Tuesday warning that the ""Chinese Government is moving troops to the Border with Hong Kong.""
The Chinese government's liaison office in Hong Kong couldn't be reached to comment Thursday but has said it supports the Hong Kong government and police in punishing violent criminals according to the law.
Hong Kong already hosts a 6,000-strong garrison of the People's Liberation Army, the armed forces of China's ruling Communist Party, but is unlikely to deploy it for fear of doing deeper damage to Hong Kong's international business links and to the image of President Xi, according to Willy Lam, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Jamestown Foundation.
Even so, Mr. Lam added, the repeated use by Beijing of the word ""terrorism"" in relation to the protests ""looks like laying down the justification for using Chinese forces,"" such as the paramilitary.

Hong Kong's Leader Yields to Protesters --- City's chief executive withdraws extradition measure in face of major demonstrations,"HONG KONG -- Chief Executive Carrie Lam offered her first major concession to protesters' demands after months of unrest in Hong Kong, saying she would withdraw the extradition bill that sparked the turmoil.
In a recorded address on Wednesday, Mrs. Lam said the move was to allay public concerns. She also pledged to increase dialogue with the community and said she would seek an independent review of the political, economic and social climate.
The withdrawal of the bill addresses one of five demands from the opposition movement and is a compromise that appears aimed at weakening popular support for the protests, though it isn't clear if it will reduce the tensions that have gripped the city for three months.
The withdrawal is the first direct concession to protesters' demands aimed at resolving the crisis. Such a move by the top official of the Chinese territory would require endorsement from Beijing.
During the turmoil, public approval of the chief executive and satisfaction with the government have hit their lowest levels since China regained sovereignty over the former British colony in 1997.
""I recognize that these may not be able to address all the grievances of people in society,"" Mrs. Lam said. ""However, should we all think deeply whether escalating violence and disturbances is the answer? Or whether it is better to sit down to find a way out through dialogue.""
The uprising in Hong Kong is one of the biggest challenges facing President Xi Jinping of China. In a speech on Tuesday, Mr. Xi called for a determined fight to overcome any risk or challenge that endangers Communist Party leadership or harms China's sovereignty and security, state media reported. Mr. Xi didn't name Hong Kong.
Demonstrations against the bill in June led Mrs. Lam to suspend the legislation -- which would have allowed citizens to be sent for trial in mainland China's opaque justice system -- but her failure to formally scrap the proposal has fueled mass peaceful protests and increasingly violent actions by hard-core activists who have clashed with police.
Withdrawing the bill from the legislature means it can't be revived as easily as it could have been while suspended.
The protests have now developed into a broader opposition movement with additional demands, including an inquiry into the Hong Kong Police Force's handling of the demonstrations and calls for greater democracy, demands that have angered Beijing.
Thousands of protesters took to the social-media app Telegram to say the concession wasn't enough and they would continue to push for all their demands.
""Too little, too late,"" said pro-democracy figure Joshua Wong, who called Mrs. Lam's announcement deceptive. ""Whenever the government appears to extend an olive branch, they always come with a far tighter grip on civil rights.""
On Wednesday evening, a few dozen pro-democracy supporters gathered at the Legislative Council building. ""Hong Kongers will not be satisfied by a partial victory,"" a masked protester said. ""And our thirst for freedom and justice will not be quenched.""
Sporadic clashes between small groups of protesters and police continued into early Thursday in several districts.
Earlier, Hong Kong stocks jumped on reports of plans to withdraw the legislation. The city's benchmark Hang Seng Index rose 4% on Wednesday, its biggest one-day gain since November.
""Withdrawing the bill is an important first step to restore business confidence and the city's international reputation,"" said Robert Grieves, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.
The unrest has torn a hole in Hong Kong's economy, dented its reputation as an international finance center and a safe place to do business.
Thousands of workers went on strike this week and university and high-school students boycotted classes and held protests, dashing government hopes that the opposition movement would peter out once school resumed.
Mrs. Lam said no new inquiry was needed into police actions during the protests as a probe was already under way by an independent police complaints council, to which she added two new members.
Critics have expressed distrust in that body and have said it lacks objectivity. The council doesn't have investigative power, can't summon witnesses and includes many pro-government figures.

NBA Plays Silent Game in China --- A tense showdown in Shanghai finally leads to a basketball exhibition -- but a post-game media ban feels like a mistake,"On Thursday in Shanghai, the Los Angeles Lakers played the Brooklyn Nets in a beautiful display of NBA basketball in the nation of China. A fantastic game was enjoyed by all.
How am I doing? Is this how this is supposed to roll?
The NBA players were not permitted to speak to the media after the game. However, it is presumed that basketball superstars such as LeBron James and Anthony Davis had a wonderful time, as well as Kyrie Irving, who hurt his face and missed the rest of the contest.
Whew. All that relentless positivity is exhausting. I sound like one of those people who doesn't drink coffee.
After five days of international tumult -- and a lot of speculation that the game would get canceled; they were yanking down a giant promotional banner for it days before -- the NBA played the first of its exhibitions in China on Thursday, with a glaring condition from the host: the players and league commissioner Adam Silver would not be made available for news conferences after the game.
Just the game? And no media chit-chat? It's the Bill Belichick Fantasy! The Grumpy Lobster Boat Captain is probably planning a 2020 preseason Patriots/China tour as we speak.
The back story to all this you surely know: Last week, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, while in Japan for an exhibition series there, sent out a now-deleted tweet that showed support for protesters in Hong Kong. The Chinese government took offense, the NBA went into furious damage control mode, the league was blasted for cowering, a good deal of the sports media handled the story like it was loose nuclear material, or avoided it altogether, Ted Cruz and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez actually signed the same letter of condemnation, President Trump hauled off on Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr, and everyone who's ever wanted to put ""NBA"" and ""hypocrisy"" in the same sentence got their opportunity, and ""South Park"" got it right, like it always does.
Who says preseason basketball is uninteresting!
And now: an interview-free NBA postgame. It was an odd concession after the embattled NBA had spent much of this week insisting it supported the right of its personnel to freely express themselves.
Now critics of every angle and motive are gleefully piling on: the NBA shut up and dribbled! I must have read the line already 1,000 times this morning.
If the NBA hopes playing this game moves the story along, I don't see it. Maybe there's 3-D diplomacy happening behind the scenes, but this trip feels like something to get home from as soon as possible. Voices in the U.S. have been urging the league to pack it in and leave. That bipartisan letter co-signed by Cruz and Ocasio-Cortez and other members of Congress urged the league to suspend its activities in China and re-evaluate its training camp in Xinjiang, ""where up to a million Chinese citizens are held in concentration camps as part of a massive, government-operated campaign of ethno-religious repression.""
One game doesn't make this go away. What happens when everyone gets back from China? Where will the NBA draw its lines? A reporter in Japan asking the Rockets about the controversy was told ""basketball questions only."" There have been small protests in support of Hong Kong demonstrators at preseason NBA games in the U.S. What is the strategy going forward? And, of course: What does this possibly mean for the woebegone Knicks?
This is what happens when businesses tangle with China, the crisis managers said, reminding everyone how many times that U.S. companies have set aside values and grandly apologized for perceived offenses in order to remain in the market. One expert told the Journal's reporters that Adam Silver had actually been rather bold in his public comments, because he wasn't explicitly apologizing, and he'd defended Morey's right to say what he said.
But it's hard to see playing -- and not talking -- as righteous progress.
With the world watching, the NBA agreed to terms they're not supposed to be about. I'm betting it will be characterized as a tiny nudge forward, a suboptimal fix for a no-win situation, a compromise on foreign soil, a gesture, because the league didn't want to disappoint Chinese fans, and the players wanted to get out there, but it looks a lot like getting rolled by a state accustomed to having its way.
Or maybe it just looks like this:
An amazing basketball adventure in China, with star players competing in a brilliant sporting display.
You'll have to choose your version of events. On Thursday, the NBA agreed not to say.

World News: Hong Kong Chief Pressed to Quit --- Criticism grows over Lam's handling of extradition bill that sparked mass protests,"HONG KONG -- Pressure mounted on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam as protesters called for her to step down and members of her cabinet urged her to personally respond, a day after a mass rally triggered by her handling of a contentious extradition bill.
Mrs. Lam remained out of public view following Sunday's march, which organizers said nearly two million people took part in to demand she revoke the bill and resign. Protesters widely decried an apology from Mrs. Lam on Sunday night, which was conveyed via a press release and written without any concession to the protesters' specific demands.
On Saturday, Mrs. Lam, under pressure from her splintering supporters, moved to indefinitely suspend passage of the bill, which would have allowed suspects to be transferred to mainland China for trial. The suspension was aimed at tamping down tensions but hasn't ended a standoff between protesters and the government over the issue.
A few hundred protesters, the remnants of Sunday's record-shattering rally, moved on Monday to surround the entrance to the chief executive's office. They had hours earlier ceded a nearby stretch of public highway they occupied overnight, which has served as a focal point of antigovernment protests as the former British colony gravitates ever closer to China.
Hong Kong's government is seeking to quell turmoil that has rocked the city and caused potential embarrassment for China's leaders in Beijing, who have backed Mrs. Lam so far in pushing and then suspending the bill.
At an extraordinary Monday meeting of the Executive Council -- an addition to the cabinet-equivalent body's regular weekly session every Tuesday -- both the future of Mrs. Lam and the bill dominated discussions, said the council's convener, Bernard Chan.
""From the position of Exco members, we think she should definitely stay on,"" Mr. Chan told The Wall Street Journal. ""I think she needs to express her sorrow, her apology over this matter. I think she will come and ask people for a chance again to do what she's good at.""
Mrs. Lam's office didn't respond to a call to comment.
A key plank of the protesters' demands is for the bill -- which roused public fears of Beijing's growing encroachment on freedoms by enabling it to whisk suspects from Hong Kong into the mainland's opaque legal system -- to be completely withdrawn, not just suspended. The suspension was seen by some as a face-saving move and advisers say the bill has been effectively shelved for the foreseeable future.
""The bill is a goner,"" Mr. Chan said. ""The legislative term ends next year. She has zero plans for any resumption.""
Still, Mr. Chan signaled the government was still biding time for the bill to remain as a discussion piece. He said it has ""certain merits,"" especially in conducting Hong Kong's international legal obligations -- and it could re-emerge in later sessions without its most controversial element, he said.
""There's the possibility that it may exclude China,"" Mr. Chan said.
The embattled chief executive is expected to hold meetings with various groups including educators, Mr. Chan said. Students have played a key role in protests against the bill.
As these meetings kicked off on Monday, Joshua Wong, a charismatic student leader, was released from prison where he was serving a sentence for his role in pro-democracy protests in 2014. Mr. Wong immediately called for Mrs. Lam's resignation, the bill's withdrawal, and repeated other demands.

World News: Hong Kong Protesters Say City Leader Must Do More,"HONG KONG -- Opponents of Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam vowed further protests, dealing a setback to her attempt to quash unrest sparked by a bill that would legalize extradition to China.
Mrs. Lam said Tuesday that the bill was ""dead,"" but didn't say that it would be withdrawn. Barely two hours after she spoke, the Civil Human Rights Front, a broad coalition organizing opposition to the measure, held a news conference to dismiss her remarks.
""All the things she said do not mean anything, as far as we can see,"" said the group's vice convener, Bonnie Leung. ""Two million people have already come out on the streets. This figure will not go away. Does the government hear the people's voice?""
Mrs. Lam's office declined to clarify her remarks.
Her statement Tuesday that the bill is dead was her strongest so far on the legislation. Opponents want her to make clear it has been withdrawn. They also want Mrs. Lam's resignation, an independent inquiry into police conduct during the demonstrations and the dropping of charges against protesters who have been arrested.
Protest organizers say that despite Mrs. Lam's comments they continue to plan more demonstrations, moving deeper into Hong Kong's suburbs as early as this weekend, fanning out beyond the usual small area clustered around government headquarters.
The distinction in the description of the bill's status may not be obvious to outsiders, but it has become a point of contention for protesters.
Mrs. Lam's statement drew mockery among Hong Kong protesters and their sympathizers on social media. Biblically tinged witticisms sprang up on Facebook and the Reddit-like social news website LIHKG, which is popularly associated with young activists in Hong Kong's protest movement.
""The bill has died. The bill is risen. The bill will come again,"" a user called Aron Yuen posted on Facebook.
Mrs. Lam has repeatedly declined to say that the bill is ""withdrawn,"" language that is a central demand of protesters and which they have enshrined in formal statements and spray-painted on the walls of government buildings. On several occasions in the past month, as protests mounted, Mrs. Lam and her advisers have described the bill as being in various stages of anthropomorphic decline, from ""will die,"" to ""dying a natural death,"" to Tuesday's remark that it was ""dead.""
Pro-Beijing legislators said criticism of Mrs. Lam's comments amounted to an argument over semantics and that the government still needed to improve its communications.
""The government has difficulty recruiting an able communicator,"" said Regina Ip, a lawmaker and former contender for the chief executive post. ""Our civil servants are brought up to be technocrats.""
Mrs. Lam has spent her career in the city's civil service. She has been loath to make concessions after the biggest protests in the city's history against a bill she sponsored. But quelling unrest has taken on more urgency since Beijing warned that it could intervene directly if the protests worsen.
Mrs. Lam blamed her government for a ""total failure"" in carrying out preparatory work on the bill.
""Even if she fully pulls the bill now, is it enough at this point?"" said David Zweig, former social-sciences professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
The refusal to say the bill is withdrawn is likely face-saving for Mrs. Lam and the central government in Beijing, which had approved the bill, Mr. Zweig said.
China's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said the government had expressed its ""respect and understanding"" when Hong Kong suspended the bill on June 15.

"World News: Hurt by Protests, Hong Kong Falls Into Recession","HONG KONG -- Since antigovernment protests erupted here in June, hotels have become ghost towns. Restaurants, normally heaving with tourists and locals, are struggling to attract diners. Nearly a quarter of American businesses polled said they were considering moving capital or assets out of the city.
And the city is now officially in a recession.
Hong Kong's economy shrank 3.2% in the July-to-September quarter from the period just before, according to data released on Thursday. That is the worst quarter-to-quarter drop since 2009. On a year-to-year basis, the economy shrank 2.9%.
If anything, the figures undersell the speed and severity of the downturn for shopkeepers, restaurant owners and others with consumer-facing businesses.
For some entrepreneurs in Hong Kong, business is as tough as they can remember. This is after nearly a quarter-century that saw two financial crises, a transfer of sovereignty to China from the U.K., the deadly SARS epidemic and an earlier wave of protests in 2014.
The gloom risks becoming self-reinforcing: 46% of respondents to a recent American Chamber of Commerce poll said they were pessimistic about Hong Kong's long-term prospects. Nearly a quarter were considering moving capital, assets or operations out of Hong Kong, in many cases to Singapore.
""I haven't been this stressed ever in the restaurant business,"" said Que Vinh Dang, a chef who has spent 22 years in the industry. Mr. Dang said sales at his nearly year-old Vietnamese restaurant, Nhau, have almost halved since the protests started. The 43-year-old said conditions were more challenging than during SARS, the global financial crisis or 2014's Umbrella Movement protests.
Dozens of small-business owners have made appeals on social media for people to visit their stores and buy their products and services, but they have largely refrained from criticizing the protest movement or blaming it for their predicaments. One risk is businesses perceived to have taken sides against the protesters -- like the city's subway system and a local operator of restaurant chains -- have been vandalized. In addition, public opinion polls are continuing to reflect high levels of public dissatisfaction with the government and police.
Mr. Dang said he sympathized with the demonstrators, but thought some of their demands were implausible.
Tour company Hong Kong DolphinWatch has been in operation since 1995. It was forced to cancel most of its weekday trips to view the city's pink dolphins this summer because of the protests. Bookings on Sundays, its busiest day, have fallen substantially.
""For the first time ever, I googled how to close a company,"" said Bennie To, a manager at the company. After undertaking a social-media campaign to help generate sales, she said the business recovered to break-even levels as of September. But she remains concerned about what lies ahead.
The second straight quarter of contraction means Hong Kong is now in recession -- hit not only by social unrest but also by the U.S.-China trade war and weaker global growth. In a recent blog post, Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the economic contraction could last a full year.
A steep drop in tourism, predominantly from mainland China, has been accompanied by tumbling retail sales. Hotels have slashed prices to woo bookings. Mr. Chan wrote in his post that hotel occupancy had crashed to 66% in August from above 90% previously.
London-listed InterContinental Hotels Group PLC operates the Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn and InterContinental hotels, among others. It told investors recently that in Hong Kong, its revenue per available room fell by more than 50% in September. At the Hong Kong operations of rival Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., revenue per room was down 40% in the third quarter.
Hong Kong retail sales as measured by value fell 23% in August from a year earlier, the worst monthly decline on record, according to government statistics. Sales of jewelry, watches, clocks and other valuable gifts fell by a record 47%, while sales at department stores dropped 30%.
Meanwhile, Anthony Rendall -- a yacht broker -- said a slowdown had forced him to expand abroad to places like the Philippines and Thailand. ""My business has come to a grinding halt with no recovery in sight,"" he said.
Some business owners are hoping the worst is over. Girish Jhunjhnuwala, CEO of Ovolo Hotels Group, said occupancy rates at the chain's four Hong Kong hotels dropped to as low as 40% in August, forcing them to cut prices by a fifth. More recently, Ovolo was able to raise rates as occupancy levels have improved to between 65% and 75%, thanks to business travelers returning to the city. But they are still a far cry from the roughly 95% occupancy levels the hotels used to enjoy.
With the end of the protests nowhere in sight, ""this is just something that we are going to have to live with,"" Mr. Jhunjhnuwala said.

Trump and the 'Globalists',"President Trump at the United Nations this week elaborated on his long-running antagonism toward globalism. ""The future does not belong to globalists,"" Mr. Trump said. ""The future belongs to patriots. The future belongs to sovereign and independent nations who protect their citizens, respect their neighbors, and honor the differences that make each country special and unique.""
There is merit to these concerns, but I think the critics of ""globalism,"" including most prominently Mr. Trump, underestimate the near-term danger of the serious difficulties appearing today in national democratic governance.
Democracies maintain their legitimacy in the public's eye only if they demonstrate a reasonable capacity to address society's inevitably complex challenges. Especially now, with Xi Jinping in China and Vladimir Putin in Russia and even Iran's Hassan Rouhani actively offering as an alternative model the administrative state on authoritarian steroids.
Democracies always struggle to perform, but it's clear that many of the 21st century's independent nations are having a remarkably difficult time executing their sovereign responsibilities.
Starting here. Congress, the more than 230-year-old legislative branch of the U.S. government, is deadlocked, with even the passage of a national budget becoming impossible.
Defuse the U.S. entitlement bombs? Forget it. Infrastructure? Too complicated. Republican House members, in the minority, are quitting, and who can blame them for abandoning a low-satisfaction job?
The anti-Trump obsession has created a degree of political bitterness and polarization that is killing the possibility of normal governance. Instead of passing the trade deal with Mexico and Canada, the House will wallow in impeachment mud the next 13 months.
Elsewhere, the month of October is bookended with two major crises in governance. Oct. 31 is the nominal drop-dead date for the United Kingdom's scheduled departure from the European Union, unless Parliament kicks the beat-up Brexit can down another back alley. The U.K. has arrived at the spectacle of opposition parties resisting a national election.
But the more significant October event is less than a week off -- Tuesday's 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. President Xi Jinping, unelected successor to the regime's founder, Mao Zedong, no doubt has celebrations of communism planned for all 1.3 billion of his country's people. The people of Hong Kong won't be attending.
They will be in the streets, as they have been every weekend for months, putting their lives at risk to get what we're supposed to believe many Americans now say isn't our problem -- democracy building.
In fact, Hong Kong is ground zero in the ideological struggle between government by independent peoples and the China model of do-what-you're-told governance.
The Chinese model survives with mass surveillance and unappealable criminal prosecutions, which would have been extended to Hong Kong by the extradition bill that caused the demonstrations.
Hong Kong's protests prove that no free people would voluntarily opt in to the Chinese Communist Party system. But China's control model could still prevail. The Chinese and Mr. Putin have the patience to wait until their sovereign nation-state rivals exhaust the assent of their frustrated populations.
When massive flows of refugee migrants from Syria and North Africa entered Europe in 2015, the member nations of the EU proved incapable of fashioning an effective response. Publics lost faith in their governments' political competence, which produced significant support for fringe parties in the EU's elections last May.
The U.S. Congress has lost its capacity to rationalize the immigration laws, so the mess festers on the border. In Europe and in the U.S., the vast revenue needs of the welfare-entitlement state are suppressing policy options to improve economic opportunity for younger generations or pay for future national security.
Mr. Trump's concerns about undemocratic governance by remote international bureaucracies are plausible, but the greater threat is more imminent. If the expansion of an increasingly dysfunctional administrative state inside the world's sovereign democracies is inexorable and unreformable, the future will belong to China's brand of administrative authoritarianism. The default option for disgusted and ""sovereign"" people could be a desire simply to get things done by fiat.
Arguably, Elizabeth Warren and her multiple plans -- heavily dependent on criminal prosecutions and intense oversight -- is flirting with a milder version of this future. With Congress in polarized decline, both the Obama and Trump presidencies have governed heavily by executive order, which could be described as a slow slide toward soft authoritarianism. Some on the left and right would probably be fine with that.
""If you want freedom,"" Mr. Trump told the U.N., ""take pride in your country. If you want democracy, hold on to your sovereignty."" Holding on to a nation's identity is important. But national pride won't matter much if democratic governance degrades into ineffectuality.

"Hong Kong Protests Force Companies to Take a Side --- Employers try to balance workers' freedoms, pressure from Beijing","On the eve of an antigovernment protest by accountants in Hong Kong, a PricewaterhouseCoopers executive warned his staff not to do anything that could put the firm in a bad light.
""It is important we do not misrepresent or compromise the firm through individual actions,"" Raymund Chao, PwC's chairman for Asia Pacific and Greater China, said in a Thursday memo to employees.
A wave of protests, now in its third month, is pitting Hong Kong's freedoms against Beijing's authority. Companies can't afford a misstep.
Pressure from China cost the CEO of Hong Kong flagship Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. his job after some employees took part in marches and Beijing threatened to cut off access to its airspace. E-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Inc. pulled a planned listing of shares in Hong Kong, reasoning that market and political conditions weren't right for a deal that would be a boon for the city's stock market. A top Chinese official overseeing Hong Kong exhorted the city's property tycoons and other elites to publicly support the local government and condemn violent protesters.
Such is the pressure corporations operating in Hong Kong face as they try to balance demands from one of their most important markets -- mainland China -- with the sentiments of many employees and a wide swath of the Hong Kong population that supports the protests.
""Every company in Hong Kong is in a delicate situation,"" said Michael Tien, a Hong Kong lawmaker, and has to decide how to respond when employees want time off to protest. ""When the central government puts pressure on companies, it's going to start a series of ripple effects among employees that will cause even more divisiveness internally,"" he said.
In the latest confrontations, protesters barricaded streets and threw some firebombs as they clashed with police Saturday and Sunday, leading police to bring out a water cannon for the first time. The street fights followed an enormous, peaceful rally a week earlier that organizers estimate drew 1.7 million people, nearly a quarter of the city's population. Smaller protests have been held by teachers, lawyers, civil servants and airport staff.
As a result of the turmoil, the city's economic pillars are wobbling. Tourism and yacht sales are in decline, conferences have been canceled, deals have been pushed back. Companies including InterContinental Hotels Group PLC have told employees to take leave as business dried up.
Hong Kong's stock market has lost nearly $300 billion in market value since the end of June. The cumulative damage to spending and investment is threatening to tip the city's $363 billion economy -- roughly the size of Israel's -- into recession. Analysts at Morgan Stanley expect Hong Kong's economic growth for the quarter ending in September will be the worst in a decade.
Hong Kong has been through several bouts of protests since the handover to China from the U.K. 22 years ago, and the city has continued to grow. Travel industry executives say tourism and business travel could rebound quickly if the unrest ends.
Today, however, pressure on Hong Kong's economy is compounded by the spiraling trade war between the U.S. and China as well as weak global growth. In the most extreme scenario, if China were to use force to quell the protests, many diplomats and business people say Hong Kong's days as a financial capital could be numbered.
""The brain drain from Hong Kong, which is already under way, would accelerate, and talented foreigners would be further deterred from moving here,"" said David Webb, an investor in Hong Kong.
The protests kicked off in earnest on June 9 when an estimated one million people marched in opposition to a bill that would have allowed suspects to be extradited for trial in China.
Early on, many companies publicly supported their employees' right to protest against the extradition bill. Some allowed time off with no questions asked.
Employers became cautious as marches grew into a broader pro-democracy movement, with demands including universal suffrage, and as attacks on China's national emblem and main office in Hong Kong raised Beijing's ire. The protests descended into a series of clashes with police across the city.
On Aug. 7, a senior Chinese official in charge of Hong Kong affairs warned a gathering of the city's elite, whom he had summoned to a meeting in Shenzhen, that the Chinese central government wouldn't hesitate to intervene if the situation worsened.
Since that meeting, Hong Kong tycoons, conglomerates and global financial firms have taken out newspaper ads declaring their support for Hong Kong's government. Ads from U.K.-based banks HSBC and Standard Chartered PLC called for an end to the unrest.
On Aug. 9, executives from Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings PLC and other banks and business groups were called to a meeting with Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam to discuss ways to address the city's economic issues.
As the discussion drew to a close, attendees unexpectedly were asked to stand with Ms. Lam at a news conference. Most declined, uncomfortable with being pressed to stand publicly behind the government, according to people familiar with the closed-door meeting.
Peter Wong, CEO of the Asia-Pacific unit of HSBC, which was founded in Hong Kong and is heavily exposed to business with China, was among the few who agreed to join Ms. Lam on stage. (HSBC confirmed Mr. Wong was on stage but didn't comment.) Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was among banks invited to the meeting that didn't attend, those familiar with the gathering said.
The varying reactions show how companies are caught between standing up for their own values, and their employees, while also protecting their business with China.
Cathay Pacific had allowed employees to join marches but reversed its support after Chinese aviation authorities said they would review the staffing of all Cathay Pacific flights that traverse China's airspace and bar any carrying crew members who participated in the demonstrations.
The airline warned staff in an email Aug. 12 of ""disciplinary consequences for employees who support or participate in illegal protests."" That effectively means most, since police have refused permits for the majority of recently proposed demonstrations and marches. The airline has fired at least two pilots, two ground staff members and a cabin-crew union leader at a subsidiary.
Cathay said last week its business wasn't affected in July, but that it expects ""a much more significant impact to our revenue in August and onwards"" as business and leisure travel into Hong Kong drops.
Flight bookings to Hong Kong from elsewhere in Asia excluding China and Taiwan, where the timing of a holiday affected the data, fell 20% from June 16 through Aug. 9 compared with a year earlier, according to Olivier Ponti, a vice president at Forward Keys, a company that analyzes bookings. In the first 5 1/2 months of the year, by comparison, such bookings rose 6.6%.
Australian airline Qantas said last week it will start using smaller planes for flights into and out of Hong Kong, cutting capacity by 7% until tensions abate.
Cathay's newly appointed chief customer and commercial officer, Ronald Lam, reiterated the company's resolute support for Hong Kong's government and its police in an Aug. 22 memo to the airline's business partners.
In the city's International Finance Center, which houses many financial firms and luxury retail stores, some shops closed early on several days in August during violent protests. Stores including Dior, Tiffany & Co. and Samsonite have shortened their operating hours in some stores to allow staff to get home safely. Foot traffic has also fallen.
An employee at LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE's Swiss watch unit Tag Heuer said, ""With less tourists, our sales KPI have dropped,"" referring to the store's performance metrics. All sales are dropping ""unless you're selling masks now -- and this,"" he said, putting his hand on his headin reference to helmets worn by the protesters.
Tiffany, Samsonite and LVMH didn't respond to requests for comment. Dior couldn't be reached for comment.
Bobbi Brown, a makeup brand owned by New York-based Estee Lauder Cos., has told its Hong Kong retail sales staff not to wear their customary all-black work attire during their commutes out of concern they will be mistaken for protesters, said a staffer at one store. She said the company sent the instructions after a violent attack on black-clad subway passengers in an outlying area a month ago. A spokeswoman for Estee Lauder said Bobbi Brown makeup artists always wear black and that the dress code is part of the company's brand identity.
On Friday, an estimated 5,000 people took part in an accounting industry protest in Hong Kong's business district. Many wore face masks along with their regular office attire. A team of auditors from BDO donned sunglasses and held signs that read: ""Restore Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times.""
One man wore a dress shirt along with a yellow helmet, black mask and an eyepatch with fake blood -- recent symbols of the violent protests. The 29-year-old, who said his surname was Li, said accountants were on the streets to show that ""everyone who loves Hong Kong will go out.""
China's state-owned media criticized the Big Four accounting firms, KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and Ernst & Young, which employ thousands of people in Hong Kong, after some of their workers took out a newspaper ad criticizing their leadership for putting priority on business over their staff's ""yearning for democracy and freedom.""
The accounting firms have all said they don't condone violence or illegal acts. ""We are concerned that unauthorized statements made by individuals might be mistakenly taken as representing the firm's view on the current situation,"" said a spokeswoman for PwC.
EY's leaders warned employees in a staff memo Aug. 13 not to take part in illegal activity or use company equipment for nonbusiness purposes, and chastised people for using its brand on social-media messages supporting the protests. EY declined to comment.
In this environment, controls on communications can extend even to personal messages. In a farewell note on Aug. 15, a customer-service employee at American Express Co. told colleagues she was leaving after nine years to take care of her young daughter and help with a family business.
She also mentioned she had donated to an organization that provides legal support to arrested protesters, and she included an image of yellow letters on a black background saying, ""Stand with Hong Kong!"" The email was recalled less than two hours after it was sent. The author of it couldn't be reached for comment.
""We acknowledge that employees have personal views on a wide range of issues,"" an American Express spokesman said. ""However, our policies state that employees should use corporate assets and systems for business-related purposes only.""

World News: Hong Kong Protesters Broaden Their Openness Agenda,"HONG KONG -- Protests that began six weeks ago as a challenge to Beijing's growing reach are broadening into a movement pursuing a range of political and social grievances, with demonstrations -- and clashes with police -- spreading to new parts of the city.
Tens of thousands of people joined a mostly peaceful, locally organized march Sunday in Sha Tin, the most populous district, in full view of one of the city's biggest shopping centers, popular with local residents and mainland Chinese visitors alike. After the march ended, police with shields and using pepper spray chased some protesters around scared shoppers inside the main mall.
While the major theme of the protest continued to be a contentious bill authorizing extradition to the mainland, demonstrators also protested the disqualification of pro-democracy legislators in recent years and demanded greater democracy in electing the city's leader and an investigation of police conduct during demonstrations.
Tobias Leung, 24 years old, helped organize the march in Sha Tin for residents who wanted their voices to join Hong Kong's major protests. Mr. Leung said they decided to add the disqualification of pro-democracy legislators in recent years to the list of grievances for Sunday's march after a vote on the Telegram messaging app.
""We're going back to the communities to get more citizens involved in the movement,"" said Mr. Leung, who said he applied for the permit to hold the march on behalf of residents who wanted to protest but were reluctant to give their names out of fear of repercussions from authorities. ""Hong Kongers are more united in our cause this time, which is how we've been able to hold the energy for such a long time.""
The new protests are advertised on digital fliers that sometimes use the expressions ""Take the baton"" and ""Flowers blooming across the entire city.""
""The goal is to spread the message as widely in the territory as possible,"" said James To, a Democratic Party member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council. ""These few weeks have been the last straw on people's back after having their freedoms squeezed for years, and there's a 'now or never' attitude that's driving them to the streets.""
Organizers said 115,000 people participated in Sunday's march. Police put the number at 28,000.

World News: Hong Kong Shaken After Days of Violence --- Mask ban fails to quell unrest; signs of China's presence are targeted more aggressively,"Hong Kong faces a major test Tuesday, as the city tries to return to its normal workday patterns after a long weekend of violence, shop closures and transportation halts that in effect put a curfew on daily life.
The four days of strife since the government used its emergency powers for the first time in half a century took a heavy toll on the usually bustling city.
Frequently-violent protests cropped up across Hong Kong, leaving behind a trail of arson, a few mob beatings and a lot of broken glass. Police, meanwhile, made heavy use of tear gas, firing sometimes toward people who appeared to pose little threat and shooting a 14-year-old boy in the leg with live ammunition Friday.
The city's heavily used subway system, the MTR, has been largely shut down for four days, with a full halt Friday night and Saturday and drastically limited service Sunday and Monday, a holiday here. A number of stations were flooded or burned by protesters angry at operator MTR Corp.'s perceived cooperation with the government and the police.
Pedestrians picked their way through a broken city Monday, gingerly navigating the clear spots in walkways left by protesters who had dug up the bricks to lob them at police or strew them in the road to slow their charges. Many families had stayed indoors since Friday night, cowed -- and sometimes dismayed -- by the violence.
Violence continued Monday night, as protesters in some areas threw petrol bombs and a small bicycle at police, wrecked subway facilities, and broke some glass panes in shopping centers.
""I still support the protests, but I want them to focus back on the right path,"" said Chung, a 34-year-old woman who works at a cafe. ""The target is wrong now.""
Both the uprising that began as a protest against an unpopular extradition bill and the government's struggle to lead the city out of chaos are now deep in uncharted waters.
Many in and around the protest movement are questioning the effectiveness of tactics like smashing or burning businesses -- like those owned by Starbucks Corp. franchisee Maxim's Group -- that are perceived to be unfriendly to the cause.
Meanwhile, the government's effort to push protesters off the streets by using its emergency powers to outlaw masks has had the opposite effect of raising the level of anger and bringing more people into the street.
Officials haven't ruled out imposing further measures under emergency powers if the mask ban doesn't work. Ip Kwok-him, an adviser to Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, said in a radio interview Monday that the government wouldn't rule out steps including an internet ban as long as it could be shown to be effective.
The government has been reluctant to take such a step, which would be hard to enforce and make Hong Kong far less attractive for business. But a failure to get things under control raises the risk that Beijing could intervene.
Marchers are more aggressively targeting signs of China's presence in the city, badly vandalizing local branches of the state-owned Bank of China Ltd. and Bank of Communications Co. In one case, protesters on Saturday wrecked a branch of Shanghai Commercial Bank Ltd., a Taiwan-based company, after mistaking it for a mainland business. They later spray-painted ""sorry"" under its signage.
Black-clad protesters hurled petrol bombs inside subway stations and set fires in a number of entrances. The government said the subway was ""extensively trashed.""
The system shut early Sunday and Monday. MTR Corp. didn't indicate when normal services would resume. It didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.
The massive protest movement has drawn strength from widespread perceptions in the city that the police have acted brutally. The 14-year-old boy was the second person to be shot with live ammunition since the protests began in June. The other, an 18-year-old student, was struck in the chest last Tuesday afternoon.
New protest tactics have spread police out across the city, leaving them outnumbered at times and facing intensifying attacks. The officer who shot the young boy Friday had been dragged from his car and had a petrol bomb thrown at him. Police said some rioters had attacked a plainclothes police officer, and, ""with his life under serious threat, the officer had to use his pistol.""
In a breach of past norms where educational institutions were largely off limits to police, officers on Sunday entered a local university and arrested five students, accusing them of illegal assembly.
""I saw them enter the school area, and point flashlights at students and push them using shields,"" said K.K., a 21-year-old student. Student representatives of the residence halls said the police intrusion at Hong Kong Baptist University was an ""abuse of power.""
The university said in an email to students that police entered campus grounds while chasing a protester. Police didn't immediately offer any comment.
The extent of violence drew a response for the first time on Sunday from China's garrison in the city. As protesters trained laser lights on one of its barracks, soldiers on the rooftop raised a yellow banner warning protesters that they could be arrested for being ""in breach of the law."" An official at China's Liaison Office, which coordinates policy with the People's Liberation Army in the city, declined to comment.

World News: Hong Kong Chief's Speech Derailed,"HONG KONG -- Pro-democracy lawmakers shouted down Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and forced her to deliver an address by video in which she promised billions of dollars in social-welfare initiatives but resisted the political demands of antigovernment protesters who have disrupted the city for more than four months.
Twice Mrs. Lam went to the podium of the Legislative Council to deliver her annual policy speech, only to be interrupted by opposition lawmakers' chant of ""five demands, not one less,"" a popular protest slogan. The same message was projected onto walls in the chamber.
When Mrs. Lam left for the second time, some lawmakers threw signs in her direction. They later called on her to resign, saying she has no mandate. When Mrs. Lam finally delivered the speech via video, she slammed protesters, who she said were ""spreading chaos and fear in Hong Kong and seriously disrupting people's daily lives.""
But she focused on economic and social-welfare issues, such as a shortage of housing that she called a source of public grievances. She pledged more low-cost homes and easier access to mortgages for first-time home buyers in a city where property prices are among the world's highest.
The cost of the various programs, which include handouts for students and poorer families, could exceed $2 billion, according to Wall Street Journal calculations.
""I hereby set a clear objective that every Hong Kong citizen and his family will no longer have to be troubled by or preoccupied with the housing problem, and that they will be able to have their own home in Hong Kong, a city in which we all have a share,"" Mrs. Lam said.
The measures are aimed at boosting livelihoods as Mrs. Lam seeks to sap momentum from the protest movement without offering any more concessions.
Last month, she pledged to withdraw the extradition bill that first triggered the protests, but protesters' demands widened. They now call for an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality in handling the protests, an amnesty for arrested protesters and greater democratic rights.
One protest group rejected Mrs. Lam's initiatives on Wednesday, suggesting her policy address -- similar to the State of the Union -- would do little to ease tensions in the global finance hub.
""We believe that it is highly unrealistic for her to quell public grievances towards police brutality by only pushing out minor repairs to society,"" said the Civil Human Rights Front, which organized some of the biggest antigovernment rallies.
The protests, which at times have brought the city to a standstill, have threatened Hong Kong's position as a business hub and complicated President Trump's trade negotiations with China. Mrs. Lam said more than 1,100 people have been injured and more than 2,200 arrested.
Mrs. Lam declared her commitment to the ""one country, two systems"" principle that has governed Hong Kong's autonomy and individual liberties since its return to China. Advocating independence for Hong Kong or threatening China's sovereignty or security won't be tolerated, she said.
""These are big and bold measures, but it looks like she's trying to buy time,"" said Edmund Cheng, associate professor of comparative politics at City University of Hong Kong. Mrs. Lam's focus on livelihood reflects what she sees as the root causes of the unrest, he said.

World News: A Movement That Thrived Without Leaders Stumbles,"Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters have said they benefit from being leaderless, a strategy that has allowed them to strike rapidly and outfox authorities. That now threatens to be the movement's undoing.
An airport occupation turned to frenetic violence Tuesday, handing Beijing a public-relations victory, dividing protesters over tactics and jeopardizing their public support.
It revealed a downside to being without a public leader: There is no one to rein in young, angry demonstrators who are becoming increasingly aggressive.
Videos of mobs of protesters turning on two men they suspected to be pro-Beijing infiltrators, tying them up and manhandling them, shocked many viewers on social media. Protesters were also filmed shouting and cursing at travelers trying to pass a human wall that blocked them from reaching immigration and flights.
China's government described the events as bordering on terrorism and declared that the perpetrators must be severely punished. Hong Kong's government and police force joined the outrage, after days on the defensive over police use of force.
After 10 weeks of protests, the spiraling violence and civil disruption have spread anxiety in Hong Kong. Business leaders have become more outspoken in support of tougher action by local authorities to quell the unrest. The disruptions are biting into the retail and tourism sectors that help drive Hong Kong's economy and threaten to undermine its reputation as a stable base for banks and multinationals.
Hong Kong is formally under Chinese control, but its citizens enjoy greater social freedoms than in mainland China. Hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents, concerned those freedoms are under threat, have joined protests this summer.
In recent weeks, thousands of hard-core activists have more frequently skirmished with police and impeded access on roads and subway trains and in shopping districts.
Mainland China's public was galvanized by Tuesday night's events. On the popular Weibo microblogging service, one discussion topic, titled ""I also support Hong Kong police,"" had more than two billion views by Wednesday evening.
""Chinese people, remember this day!"" wrote a Weibo microblogger who has more than 8.5 million followers.
The Hong Kong police condemned the actions of protesters on Wednesday, following scenes in which police used pepper spray inside the terminal and one officer drew a gun after being set on by protesters who snatched his baton.
""If there is no violent attacks against the police. . .there is no reason for us to deploy whatever level of force,"" said Mak Chin-ho, assistant commissioner of police operations.
Some groups representing protesters issued apologies to travelers and Hong Kongers inconvenienced by the protests. Joshua Wong, a leader of Hong Kong's Umbrella Movement protests of 2014 who has played a less prominent role in the 2019 movement, on Wednesday apologized on Twitter to reporters, ambulance staff, airport staff and affected passengers.
There were signs on Wednesday that some protesters were attempting to establish more orderly demonstrations. Social-media messages listed ground rules including not obstructing paramedics and not leaping to conclusions and attacking suspected infiltrators.
""If there was a leader he or she would stop our violence,"" said Long Hin, 26, a protester at Tuesday's airport occupation who objected to others' treatment of the alleged Beijing infiltrators, one of whom turned out to be a reporter.
But many think having a clear leadership structure would be opposed to the movement's democratic values, he said.
Ted Hui, a pro-democracy Hong Kong legislator, said the events at the airport had given Beijing a stronger hand.
""I have that worry since there is no leader, since they are not formally very well organized, that is why when the anger goes to an extreme they might overreact again,"" Mr. Hui said.

"Banking & Finance: Tensions Threaten Hong Kong Dollar Peg --- Skeptics, though, remain in the minority despite weakness against U.S. dollar","Hong Kong's standing as a financial center rests partly on its decadeslong currency peg, in which officials tightly control the exchange rate against the U.S. dollar. But street protests, trade tensions and a looming recession have pressured the Hong Kong dollar, and some investors are preparing for a rupture. Here's how the system operates, and why the skeptics are still in a minority.
There is usually nothing to see here
Hong Kong has pegged its currency to the U.S. dollar since 1983, helping make life more predictable for the city's many trading houses and financial firms. The trade-off is that this effectively forces Hong Kong to track U.S. interest rates even if, for example, tighter monetary policy might help cool local asset prices. Since 2005, the Hong Kong dollar has been allowed to trade between 7.75 and 7.85 to the U.S. dollar.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the de facto central bank, buys U.S. dollars if the local currency is too strong, or sells them if it is too weak. It has intervened dozens of times since April 2018, spending a combined US$16 billion to support the Hong Kong dollar, including some instances that took place in March. Late Monday in New York, the Hong Kong dollar traded at 7.845.
Interest rates help balance things out
Currencies respond to interest rates, as capital flows to where it can get the best returns. When the monetary authority sells U.S. dollars to buy the local currency, this drains Hong Kong dollars from the market. That pushes up borrowing costs, which can in turn increase foreign appetite for Hong Kong dollars.
Now, however, the Hong Kong dollar is weak even as local rates outstrip U.S. ones. Kevin Lai, chief economist for Asia excluding Japan at Daiwa Capital Markets, said this points to persistent capital outflows. He calculates these at about US$47 billion since early 2017. There is also some evidence of residents moving money abroad recently.
Derivatives prices suggest some unease
Some investors seem to think that the peg's days are numbered.
One-year risk-reversals, a measure of the difference in price between bullish and bearish bets on the currency, have reached highs last seen in 2016.
A higher level indicates greater bearishness, and makes sense only if there is a chance the peg could break. Theoretically, Hong Kong could change the peg's level, or anchor the currency against the Chinese yuan or a currency basket.
However, the monetary authority says it has no intention of doing so.
The HKMA said the currency peg has served Hong Kong well through many economic cycles over the past 36 years, and has been operating smoothly even with the huge fund flows in the past few years. ""We see no need and have no intention to change the system,"" the authority said.
Part of banking system's liquidity is running low
The aggregate balance measures the funds parked by banks in clearing accounts at the monetary authority. As the HKMA has propped up the currency, draining Hong Kong dollars from the banking system, this measure has fallen to the lowest in more than a decade.
The rapidly shrinking aggregate balance has caught the eye of U.S. hedge-fund manager Kyle Bass, who in April argued that Hong Kong sat atop one of the largest financial time bombs in history, and the peg could break.
However, the aggregate balance is only part of the picture. Tommy Wu, an economist at Oxford Economics, said authorities could easily replenish liquidity in the banking system by redeeming short-term bonds, known as exchange-fund bills.
Authorities have much more power in reserve
More broadly, for every dollar of local currency, Hong Kong keeps more than twice as much in its foreign-exchange reserves, which total more than US$400 billion. This calculation looks at all the cash in circulation in Hong Kong, plus the aggregate balance, and money parked in exchange-fund bills.
""There's no risk of insufficient foreign-exchange reserves to replace Hong Kong dollars if we need to,"" said Chi Lo, senior strategist for Greater China at BNP Paribas Asset Management. ""Barring a complete collapse in confidence, I don't think the currency peg will easily break.""
The question, instead, might be what level of collateral damage a stubborn defense of the peg could cause. During the Asian financial crisis in 1998, Hong Kong fought off a speculative attack but the resulting spike in interest rates sent asset prices plunging. And Mr. Bass, the hedge-fund manager, argues that a growing reliance on floating-rate mortgages would make that more dangerous this time around.

World News: Stalemate Amplifies Hong Kong Protests --- Leader condemns violence; strikes throw financial center into chaos; flights canceled,"HONG KONG -- Protests here continued for a ninth weekend, spreading to new neighborhoods and turning chaotic once more as demonstrators railed against a government that has remained mostly silent to their demands.
Protesters staged two large rallies on opposite sides of the city on Sunday, following clashes between police and protesters a day before. Thousands marched in the largely residential area of Tseung Kwan O while more rallied in Kennedy Town on the west side of Hong Kong Island.
The large crowds, fueled by public anger that hasn't abated over a summer of protest, chanted calls for democratic overhauls and demanded the complete withdrawal of a deeply unpopular extradition bill that would make it easier for Beijing to prosecute residents under mainland China's more opaque legal system. Protesters held up signs that said, ""Defend our Future.""
Many in Hong Kong see the proposed law as undermining a way of life rooted in democratic values such as rule of law and freedom of expression.
Clashes between citizens and police are growing and becoming increasingly disruptive to public life, with no sign of a political resolution to the unrest that has driven protests that are underpinned by anger at China's growing influence.
Following a pattern established in recent weeks, the protest in Tseung Kwan O took a violent turn as the peaceful rally ended. Some demonstrators hurled bricks at the local police station, breaking windows.
In the city's Western district, police fired tear gas to disperse protesters who deviated from the approved rally location. Later, many suddenly decided to head to Causeway Bay, a popular shopping and entertainment district, occupying a busy thoroughfare. Sirens blared across the city as a group of protesters blocked the entrance to the cross-harbor tunnel, causing a massive traffic jam.
The protest movement's sustained momentum, and the increasingly diverse crowd that has come out to demonstrate across Hong Kong, suggest the Asian financial hub is no closer to restoring peace, even after Beijing issued a strong warning on Monday. The Chinese central government's top office handling Hong Kong matters used a rare press conference to endorse police handling of the protests, and added pressure for the government to quickly resolve the standoff.
Top government officials have said little about the protests in recent days. Chief Executive Carrie Lam was lampooned on a flier for not addressing the public since July 22. Early Monday, a government representative strongly condemned protester actions, saying, ""The deteriorating situation yesterday once again underlines that violent and illegal protests are spreading, pushing Hong Kong to the verge of a very dangerous situation.""
Adding to a sense of unease in the former British colony, there is almost no sign that a political resolution to the unrest will materialize soon. Mrs. Lam, who has Beijing's backing, has put the extradition law on hold. Demonstrators want the measure withdrawn completely, as well as an inquiry into police handling of the unrest and an overhaul of the voting system.
The antigovernment protest movement has appeared to gain steam even as police use more aggressive tactics to bring it to heel. After tense confrontations last weekend, police arrested dozens and took what many here viewed as a hard-line step by charging them with crimes that carry prison terms of as long as 10 years. Police said they arrested more than 20 people in relation to Saturday's protests, including for unlawful assembly and assault.
""If the government is waiting and hoping the protests fade out on their own, they are going to be disappointed,"" said Antony Dapiran, a lawyer and author of a book on dissent in the city.
Mr. Dapiran said demonstrators all weekend have had as their common slogan, ""Monday, strike!"" and clearly intended to build momentum and encourage people to join a planned general strike.
Disruptions were expected on Monday with the Hong Kong International Airport website saying potential circumstances might affect operations.
""The situation is really precarious,"" said Albert Ho, a Hong Kong human-rights lawyer who is defending several protesters arrested in recent demonstrations. ""Right now, there are a lot of young people out there who feel they have nothing to lose, who feel they are looking at the end of rule of law, of a legal system, of a culture.""

Hong Kong's Revolutionary Turn,"Hong Kong -- A Chinese official observed in August that the protests here ""have the clear characteristics of a color revolution"" -- a populist uprising that aims at overthrowing the government. Those were threatening words, but Zhang Xiaoming, director of the Chinese State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, had a point. The demonstrations have taken a revolutionary turn, heightening the stakes for all involved.
The current crisis began in June as millions of Hong Kongers demanded withdrawal of an extradition bill and the resignation of Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who had pushed it. After Mrs. Lam continued to disregard her own people and the police responded to peaceful dissent with violence, the protesters' objectives broadened. One of their ""five demands"" is universal suffrage -- direct election of the chief executive and Legislative Council.
Protesters carefully note that Hong Kong's Basic Law states its ""ultimate aim"" is universal suffrage. It would still constitute a revolution -- a complete and fundamental change to the political system. Leaders would be chosen directly by voters instead of through a complicated combination of proportional representation, district council elections, functional constituencies, and an election committee that together allow Beijing to rig the outcomes and anoint its chosen leaders.
Some in Hong Kong have spent decades calling for democracy, but now ""people are risking their lives, literally"" as they protest, said Nathan Law, a pro-democracy activist and former lawmaker. ""Most of the people on the street think there's no way back -- either there will be a drastic change and their rights are protected, or their rights will be annihilated, completely destroyed.""
Calls for democracy aren't the same as calls for independence. During three recent visits, I spoke to several dozen protesters. Only two told me their objective is to separate Hong Kong from China. Most are proud of their Hong Kong identity but acknowledge the territory is part of China. ""Beijing is always going to call us separatists, but independence is not one of the present movement's demands,"" said Jeffrey Ngo, the chief researcher for pro-democracy youth activist group Demosisto. ""Fighting for democracy within our constitutional framework is going to get us closer to what 'one country, two systems' was meant to do. Self-determination does not equal independence.""
Nonetheless, because Hong Kong's government is ""a proxy regime,"" Mr. Law said, ""fighting against Hong Kong government is basically fighting against the Chinese government."" Although most protesters are reluctant to say so on the record, the crowd makes the sentiment clear. As Beijing celebrated seven decades of communism and tens of thousands of Hong Kongers took to the streets in mourning Oct. 1, the normally pristine streets here were full of graffiti denouncing ""Chinazis"" and asserting: ""When tyranny is a fact, revolution is our duty."" A protest display at the University of Hong Kong campus recently featured posters reading ""G-- D-- Commies"" and ""CCP Go To Hell."" ""Lady Liberty,"" an enormous statue of a protester, is a regular fixture at demonstrations; she carries an umbrella and a flag reading ""Free Hong Kong. Revolution Now.""
Beijing knows that revolutionary movements are contagious. The 1989 protests in Tiananmen Square erupted as anti-Communist revolutions were beginning to unfold in Eastern Europe. More recently, a one-man act of protest -- the self-immolation of Tunisian street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi on Dec. 17, 2010 -- ushered in the Arab Spring. The risk for Beijing is that mainland observers will discover that protest gets results. Mainlanders have already puzzled over why the government would back down to protests and withdraw the extradition bill, said King-wa Fu, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong who has been tracking discussions of the political crisis on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter.
China's economic growth is slowing, and Beijing is using technology to exert unprecedented control over its citizens. But discontent wouldn't be enough to provoke change. ""Until people feel confident that they're not risking their necks for nothing, they're unlikely to start a revolution,"" said Dan Edelstein, a Stanford professor who is writing an intellectual history of revolution. ""Few revolutions are total acts of desperation. There has to be some glimmer of hope in your chances of success.""
Millions of Hong Kongers have expressed their dissent peacefully, but the government has ignored most of their demands, leading a minority of protesters to believe nonviolence is futile. Their behavior has proved a gift to Chinese propagandists. In the mainland, state-run media has publicized footage of protesters fighting cops, throwing Molotov cocktails, and vandalizing metro stations. The same propagandists routinely describe Hong Kong's protesters as rioters and sometimes suggest their behavior is terroristic.
According to Chinese propaganda, the lesson from Hong Kong is that protests lead to violence and chaos, Mr. Fu said. Bring it on, say militant Hong Kongers, quoting ""The Hunger Games"": ""If we burn, you burn with us.""
Beijing's ""underlying concern is that if this kind of modern liberal idea about human society spreads, it will have some impact"" in the mainland, Mr. Fu said. But Weibo chatter suggests the propagandists have succeeded so far. Mainlanders believe Hong Kongers are fighting for independence, not freedom. Communist propaganda appeals to both nationalism and envy, depicting Hong Kongers as ingrates who turned on their country even though it allowed them more freedom and prosperity than their fellow citizens. The state-run media has also insisted that foreigners, especially Americans, are the ""black hand"" manipulating the protests.
When China parades armored vehicles and holds military drills on the Hong Kong-Shenzhen border, it's as much a message to mainlanders as to protesters. Beijing is communicating it has the means to answer unrest with violence. And brute force isn't the only means of social control. If the Chinese surveillance state can catch jaywalkers, what about dissenters? Communists have always believed in collective guilt, but the social-credit system makes enforcement more efficient. Would Bouazizi have immolated himself if he knew his family could be punished for generations?
Hong Kongers know that unless they fight back, their lives will get significantly worse. Beijing wants mainlanders to know they have more to lose than their chains.

NBA Dust-Up Shows Corporate Social-Media Risks,"Chief executives are taking vocal stands on issues like gun control, climate change and immigration, but global affairs bring a different complexity and calculation, especially for companies doing business in China.
In the aftermath of Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey's now-deleted tweet, the National Basketball Association has found the consequences of even implicitly criticizing Chinese policy can be swift and sizable.
The NBA isn't the only organization that has run afoul of the Chinese government. Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google both recently removed apps associated with Hong Kong's antigovernment protests from their digital stores after taking heat from Chinese officials.
Executives have to thread a needle when a company's commercial and financial interests clash with the CEO's personal values and the cultural values of an enterprise and its home country, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a leadership expert at the Yale School of Management. ""One of the rarely discussed downsides of globalization is you get caught in those crosscurrents,"" he said.
Yet CEOs are under pressure to be visible on social and political issues, evidenced in part by a statement released in August by the Business Roundtable. The group, which represents some of America's biggest companies, redefined its view on the purpose of a corporation. It said executives should make business decisions based on the interests of multiple stakeholders -- including employees, customers and society writ large -- rather than focus only on profits for investors.
When it comes to public expression, companies set the rules. ""Free speech only exists if you're in a government position,"" said Doug Smith, managing principal of the Pittsburgh office of law firm Jackson Lewis.
There are some exceptions. Workers can raise concerns about safety and working conditions, but bosses aren't covered by that protection. When it comes to policing speech, ""you can actually be a little more stringent with manager levels and above,"" Mr. Smith said. ""They're the face of the company,"" he added. ""How does the CEO say, 'I'm saying this but it has nothing to do with my role running the company'?""
More companies in the past two years have started bolstering their executive contracts with an eye to social media, Mr. Smith said.
They have incorporated clauses giving them more leeway to fire executives for posting something inappropriate online, including a provision saying the employer is allowed to terminate an executive if she or he does something likely to hurt the company's reputation or operations.
A couple of clients have specifically laid out social media rules in employment contracts, Mr. Smith said, in some cases specifying that executives have to run posts by a company gatekeeper.
Paul Argenti, a professor of corporate communication at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, said corporate leaders are in a tricky spot.
""Are you going to be OK when your company loses sales because of what you said?"" he said.

Banking & Finance: HSBC Looks to Sell Its French Retail Bank,"HSBC Holdings PLC is preparing to put its French retail bank on the sales block in one of its first strategic actions under new interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn, people familiar with the matter said.
The potential sale of the money-losing French unit is part of a longer-term effort to shed businesses where the bank lacks scale or strategic need, the people said. HSBC, one of the world's largest banks by assets with a sprawling global footprint, since 2011 has exited from more than 100 businesses and reduced the countries in which it operates from 87 to 65.
A person familiar with the planned disposal said the likeliest buyer would be a French bank looking to add market share. HSBC France has around 300 branches and 800,000 customers and a 2% market share in retail deposits and lending. It isn't clear what price it might fetch. European bank valuations have been depressed under the weight of slow growth and negative interest rates.
HSBC will continue to offer wholesale banking in France, and Paris will remain its hub for investment banking and corporate-banking business in the European Union if, as expected, Britain leaves the trading bloc. A formal sales process could start as soon as this fall.
A spokeswoman said the bank doesn't comment on speculation.
Mr. Quinn was appointed to the interim role in August after the ouster of former CEO John Flint, with a mandate to move swiftly to reallocate capital focusing the bank on its strengths. The move comes as HSBC faces deterioration in its earnings from slowing growth in China and Hong Kong, its main source of profits.
In August, executives warned that the continuing U.S.-China trade dispute and antigovernment protests in Hong Kong could hit revenue. In Europe, the bank is under pressure from negative interest rates and from the possible exit of the U.K. from the European Union.
HSBC entered the French retail-banking market in 2000 while on a broader spending spree across the globe. It paid around 12 billion euros, worth about $13 billion at the time, to buy Credit Commercial de France, calling it a unique opportunity to build a platform in the eurozone. It later sold off chunks of the bank and pivoted away from Europe to focus on Asian growth. More recently, the French unit has served as a ready-made base for staff and business that would serve EU customers should Brexit come to pass.
HSBC France SA in its annual report said a 55 million euro ($60.7 million) pretax loss in the retail arm last year was the ""result of adverse financial market variations and low-rate environment."" Retail banking accounted for around 40% of revenue at HSBC France. France in total contributed around 3.5% to HSBC's total $54 billion in revenue last year.

Hong Kong Makes Its Stand,"Hong Kong -- As I walk toward the epicenter of Hong Kong's protests Wednesday, my skin and eyes are a better navigation tool than Google Maps. Several blocks away from the Legislative Council, my cheeks flush. Continuing west of Arsenal Street, my bare arms tingle and burn as I count at least 20 police vans and buses queued up. A block later, I pull on my swimming goggles, but my eyes water as the lenses fog. Ahead of me, tear gas lingers in the muggy air.
Despite the danger, thousands of Hong Kongers protested near the Legislative Council building, or LegCo. Lawmakers are pushing forward a bill that would allow extradition to mainland China. That would effectively negate Hong Kong's legal independence, putting residents and foreigners alike in jeopardy. Pro-democracy activists, religious practitioners, lawyers, booksellers, businessmen and journalists would be especially at risk.
But really, no one in Hong Kong would be safe. The proposed law would threaten ""freedom of speech, freedom of gatherings -- our freedom, basically,"" a young protester tells me, standing near Harcourt Road, on the rim of the protests. ""If we say something the government doesn't like, they'll take us back to China to face an unfair trial."" That includes the prospect of torture. I ask her name, and halfway through explaining why she's afraid to give it, her eyes widen. She abruptly runs off.
Behind me, people suddenly shout and flee from near LegCo. I'm more than a block away, but a stampede seems possible, so I cross Harcourt Road by climbing over a fence and a barrier. Despite the urgency, two young men in surgical masks pause to offer me a hand. After 30 seconds, calm prevails -- just another round of tear gas, apparently. Some protesters turn back toward the epicenter, but my eyes are burning, and I'm a little rattled, so I retreat to the entrance of a nearby mall, Pacific Place.
Inside, it's a surreal mix of order and chaos. An older woman shakes her head and vents her fury about the extradition bill. She's so fired up that she grabs my pen and notebook and starts scribbling down the questions she wants me to ask the authorities on her behalf. ""Escalate???"" she scrawls -- meaning she wonders if that is the cops' intention. There's another spurt of collective panic, and many briefly rush toward the exits, despite no obvious immediate threat. Starbucks is still open, and a janitor puts down a caution sign and begins mopping.
The mall is not the frontline of the protests Wednesday afternoon, but it becomes a secondary one as the tear gas forces demonstrators to retreat from the area around LegCo using the streets and overhead walkways that lead to Pacific Place. Protesters surge into the mall when they need relief. Many wear hard hats and have their arms bandaged in cling wrap to protect their skin from the acrid air. Those gathered in the mall applaud incoming waves of frontliners.
I watch a volunteer first-aid crew descend on a young woman sprawled out on the floor. She seems to be wheezing and weepy from the tear gas. Others huddle around her and pop umbrellas to keep anyone from filming her face. I step back, and someone asks if I saw blood. I didn't, but he's afraid the police have begun shooting.
Another protester warns me to be careful -- the mall has fewer exits than you'd think. A 20-year-old student at the University of British Columbia who's back home on holiday plays down his courage. ""I'm not really protesting,"" he insists. ""Even if I'm not ready to go all out -- to be arrested, to be on the frontline -- this is support."" His plan is to buy supplies for the protesters.
Earlier in the day, I watched people on the walkways open umbrellas and drop them to the protesters below. I marveled at how whimsical the umbrellas looked, drifting down like parachutes, and wondered if they were meant to invoke Hong Kong's 2014 pro-democracy protests, the Umbrella Movement. I later read that demonstrators were using the umbrellas to shield themselves from tear gas.
Throughout the day near the Admiralty metro station, protesters passed out surgical masks. I accepted one, donning it as my skin and eyes burned from the tear gas. The flimsy mask grew drenched with sweat in the heat and humidity, and around 6 p.m. my nose began to bleed. I called it quits and headed to a nearby restaurant to write this story. As soon as I got to my laptop, I read that police also shot rubber bullets into the crowd.
Pro-democracy activists and religious leaders have called for nonviolent protest. By Wednesday night, some media reported that bricks and water bottles had been thrown at law enforcement. I didn't witness any protesters behaving violently, though I saw some moving metal fencing to barricade themselves or clear escape routes.
While protesters may outnumber law enforcement, they're clearly outgunned. Wednesday's protests appeared smaller than Sunday's, which drew more than a million people, or 1 in 7 residents. They also seemed more anxious. ""We feel quite threatened,"" one 24-year-old woman tells me. ""We're without any protection or weaponry.""
This level of civil unrest is extraordinary in an affluent society like Hong Kong, which is wealthier than the U.S. by some measures. The protesters know their likelihood of success is minuscule. In a place with a genuinely representative government, mass opposition like this would likely be enough to block legislation and even force officials to resign.
LegCo did delay its debate on the bill Wednesday amid the protests, but Chief Executive Carrie Lam has refused to withdraw it or step down. Beijing continues to support the extradition bill. On Wednesday night the city was on edge against immediate violence, but a loss of liberty is the real fear.

"Violence Erupts In Hong Kong --- Police fire tear gas, rubber bullets at protesters rallying against extradition bill","HONG KONG -- A standoff over China's encroachment on this city's legal autonomy deepened, with hundreds of police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters, as the financial center's Beijing-backed government showed no signs of yielding during a second day of widespread demonstrations.
Wednesday's protest, which followed a mass demonstration by as many as a million people on Sunday, is the biggest outbreak of public unrest in years and comes as the administration of President Xi Jinping of China moves to bring the former British colony closer to the mainland. At issue is a widely unpopular bill that would allow extradition of alleged criminals to China from Hong Kong, which critics fear will be abused by Beijing for political ends.
Mass protests in 2003 and 2012 forced the government to back away from proposed laws on national security and patriotic education in schools. Since 2014, when authorities were unmoved by a 79-day street occupation demanding Beijing grant the city greater democracy, the pendulum has swung toward the government and reduced belief among opposition groups that mass demonstrations can sway policy makers.
But the extradition bill has struck a nerve among local people who fear their freedoms are being eroded and revived an opposition movement many had written off as dead. Many protesters said they are unwilling to give up, even if they believe their defiance is futile.
The clashes, which came after thousands of people blocked key roads, reflect a widening chasm between many Hong Kong residents and their government, which they accuse of trying to rush through fundamental changes to their independent justice system at the behest of China's leaders.
The protesters occupied streets from dawn on Wednesday and forced the city's legislature to postpone a debate on the bill as the swarms of people blocked government headquarters. The debate was originally scheduled to continue Thursday before a vote next week. That session was canceled Thursday morning. The organizers of Sunday's march have urged continued action until the bill is withdrawn.
By afternoon, plumes of tear gas filled the air as officers drove back the crowds of mostly young demonstrators, some of whom were wearing masks, goggles and helmets. Police declared a riot and accused protesters, who were largely unarmed, of hurling metal rods and bricks at officers.
At 10 p.m., 72 people were injured, including two seriously, ranging in age from 15 to 66, according to the Hospital Authority. By early Thursday, most remaining protesters had left.
""Our mission today has finished,"" one protester told colleagues, saying they needed to conserve energy and regroup.
China's government signaled on Wednesday its continued support for the proposed law, which would allow authorities to send anyone who sets foot in Hong Kong to mainland China for trial for certain alleged offenses. Critics said it would subject every person in the city to the mainland's more opaque judicial system, leaving them subject to arbitrary detention and torture.
""As I've repeatedly said here, the Chinese central government firmly supports the Hong Kong SAR government in its work to advance the amendment"" of extradition legislation, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.
Still, the scale of the backlash appears to have caught Beijing by surprise, said Kristin Shi-Kupfer, director of public-policy research at the Mercator Institute for China Studies think tank in Berlin.
""They seemingly haven't thought of such broad-scale protests,"" she said. ""The protests are a huge challenge to Beijing in maintaining their grip on Hong Kong.""
The city has a population of 7.3 million compared with the country's overall 1.4 billion and plays a far less important role in the nation's economy than when China resumed sovereignty in 1997. But the city has thrived as a semiautonomous region with a Western-style legal system that forms the backbone of its thriving business culture. Its people are accustomed to values such as rule of law and due process, and many are enraged at the prospect of its erosion.
Hong Kong has prospered as a financial center linking China with the world and weathered the 2014 protests. Western banks, many of which have a presence in mainland China, have refrained from publicly choosing sides. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has warned that the law would erode the confidence of U.S. businesses based in the city.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) offered support for the protesters, saying Tuesday the proposed law imperils U.S.-Hong Kong relations.
""If it passes, the Congress has no choice but to reassess whether Hong Kong is 'sufficiently autonomous' under the 'one country, two systems' framework,"" she said.
""I hope it all works out for China and for Hong Kong,"" President Trump said Wednesday.
Opponents of the law were angered after the city's leader, Carrie Lam, declined to back down on the bill even after Sunday's mass protests that drew people from many different parts of society. Some said they don't trust the city's government and Beijing to prevent such a law from being used unfairly.
After Ms. Lam said the law was required to avoid Hong Kong becoming a haven for fugitives, the city's legislature scheduled a fast-track process to consider and vote on the bill by June 20. Anonymous fliers began circulating around the city and online calling for supporters to surround the Legislative Council building on Wednesday.
Happening right at the foot of the local headquarters of China's People's Liberation Army, the images of thousands of people once again paralyzing city streets are a potential embarrassment for Mr. Xi.
Mr. Xi will likely see the protests as a challenge to his authority and push the government in Hong Kong harder to pass the legislation, said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the London-based School of Oriental and African Studies.
""Neither the government in Hong Kong nor that in China is likely to accept they have made a mistake in introducing these laws,"" he said.

Alibaba Puts Hong Kong Listing On Hold Amid Protests in City,"Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has postponed plans for a multibillion-dollar share listing in Hong Kong, as protests now in their third month exact a deepening economic cost.
The Chinese e-commerce company was on track to launch the sale in the coming weeks but put that plan on hold due to market instability and political uncertainty in the city, according to people familiar with the matter. Alibaba executives were also concerned about the optics of one of China's highest-profile companies listing in Hong Kong amid the protests, one of the people said.
The decision was made in recent days by Alibaba's board, this person said, adding the company was in wait-and-see mode given the fluid situation. Alibaba plans to revisit its plans later in the year, assuming the turmoil will have lessened by then, but no new timeline has been set, the person said. The decision was earlier reported by Reuters.
An Alibaba spokesman said the company doesn't comment on market rumors.
Alibaba shares have traded in New York since 2014. In June, people familiar with the matter said, Alibaba filed confidential paperwork for a Hong Kong listing. Filing such documents gave the company a six-month window to list, implying it still has several months left to revisit a listing. The precise date of the original application isn't clear. Alibaba was expected to raise at least $10 billion in the share sale.
A second person, who spoke with a member of Alibaba's senior management in recent days, said the company wanted to focus on its core business and wasn't in a rush to raise capital. This person said weak market sentiment and political uncertainty were factors in the decision.
The protests and Beijing's reaction have put a lot of pressure on companies that do business in China. Last week, the chief executive of Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. resigned under pressure from Beijing after employees of Hong Kong's flagship carrier took part in the antigovernment protests.
Alibaba is the second notable share deal Hong Kong has lost out on in recent months, as the city's markets have slumped. As of Wednesday's close, the benchmark Hang Seng Index has fallen 13% from a closing peak in April, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
Anheuser-Busch InBev SA called off a nearly $10 billion listing of its Asian business in July, citing market conditions. That would have been the biggest initial public offering of the year.
Meanwhile, the U.S. IPO market has been hot this year. Several banner names have gone public, including Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft Inc., Slack Technologies Inc., Pinterest Inc., Chewy Inc. and Levi Strauss & Co, though Uber and Lyft are trading well below the prices where they went public.
So far this year, Asia-listed IPOs have raised $33.3 billion, according to Dealogic. In all of 2018, Asian IPOs raised $97.2 billion. Meanwhile, U.S.-listed IPOs have raised $46.1 billion in 2019 after raising $60.8 billion last year.
Alibaba founder Jack Ma, who is set to step down as executive chairman soon, has had to navigate shifting political winds.
Last year, Mr. Ma said he would consider listing Alibaba in Hong Kong, in response to an invitation from Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who is the target of protesters. The company also explored a second listing in mainland China.
Hong Kong officials and institutions have worked hard to court Alibaba and other prestigious Chinese companies. Last year, the stock exchange changed its rules to smooth the way for large Chinese groups already listed in the U.S. or London to add a secondary listing in the city and moved to allow listings by companies with different classes of voting stock.
Alibaba has a complex governance structure that gives Mr. Ma and other executives more control than other company shareholders.
A Hong Kong listing would create another large market for Alibaba's shares and bring in more investors who are familiar with the company, potentially boosting its valuation. Mainland Chinese investors can buy and sell many Hong Kong stocks via a trading link.

Hong Kong's Desperate Cry,"Protesters stormed Hong Kong's Legislative Council building Monday, the 22nd anniversary of the city's handover to China. The world was shocked, Beijing demanded prosecutions, and Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam condemned what she called ""extreme use of violence."" But it's important to consider why this happened.
I don't condone violence, and I applaud the vast majority of protesters in Hong Kong, who in recent weeks have remained peaceful, sometimes in the face of police brutality. But instead of simply condemning those who smashed their way into LegCo, understand that it was an act of desperation after years of frustration that their voices are ignored.
Five years ago the peaceful Umbrella Movement inspired the world but changed little. The erosion of Hong Kong's freedom, autonomy and rule of law has continued. Booksellers have been abducted and disappeared in mainland China. Pro-democracy candidates and lawmakers have been disqualified from office. Academic and press freedom have come under increasing pressure. Lawmakers have introduced a bill that would criminalize ""insults"" to China's national anthem. Pro-democracy protesters have been sentenced to long prison terms. The final straw was the bill to authorize the extradition of criminal suspects to the mainland. The decision to suspend it indefinitely, while welcome, does nothing to reassure Hong Kong people, who have seen their rights stripped. They want it withdrawn permanently.
Recent weeks have seen all these frustrations boil to the surface, turning a movement against the extradition bill into a broad call for democratic reform. Hong Kong residents rightly feel they have no say in how they are governed. The chief executive is handpicked by Beijing and rubber-stamped by a 1,200-member electoral college. The legislature is packed with pro-Beijing lawmakers from so-called functional constituencies (professional and other special-interest groups), and the disqualification of some pro-democracy legislators and candidates has further undermined confidence that the body represents the people.
Ms. Lam tried to push the extradition bill through with minimal consultation. In most democracies a leader who sparks almost a quarter of the population into protest would be forced to resign, but she is accountable to no one except Beijing.
These are the reasons Hong Kongers have continued to use the only voice they feel they have -- street protest -- and a small minority occupied the legislative chamber, in the full knowledge they were risking years in prison. These are the reasons that at least three people over the past week have committed suicide in a desperate cry for help.
The occupation of the LegCo was unlawful but far from disorderly. Protesters hung signs saying ""Do not destroy the books"" and ""Protect the valuables."" They paid for the drinks they took from the commissary. Their graffiti read: ""There are no rioters -- only a tyranny."" As prominent student leader Joshua Wong tweeted, ""The protesters who broke into the Legislative Council complex were NOT rioters. They were NOT violent. Their objective was never to harm any individuals. They wanted to make the regime hear Hong Kongers' voice, and they had no other option. WE ALREADY TRIED EVERYTHING ELSE.""
The most eye-catching moment came when the protesters unfurled the old British colonial flag. That banner symbolizes what the protesters are fighting for: freedom, human rights, the rule of law. Although Britain never gave Hong Kong full representative democracy, it governed in a way that protected basic freedoms. No one thinks the British could come back, but the flag sends the message that people want their freedom back. China promised to protect Hong Kong's way of life under ""one country, two systems,"" and it has refused to live up to that pledge.
The occupiers had three key demands: Drop the charges of rioting against protesters who clashed with police on June 12, establish an independent inquiry into police brutality, and withdraw the extradition bill for good. Their ultimate goal is reflected in the ""Admiralty Declaration,"" read on behalf of the protesters in the legislative building on Monday. It stated that ""the lack of a democratic election is the root of all evils.""
The solution to this crisis is increasingly clear. Even Jasper Tsang, a pro-Beijing former Legislative Council chairman, has said that the Hong Kong government should weigh democratic reform. He also urged Ms. Lam to consider granting amnesty for protesters convicted of criminal charges.
If China and the Hong Kong government arrest and prosecute the protesters and continue to throttle the city's spirit, there will be more mass protests and increasingly violent acts. People and capital will flee. If the authorities pull back and introduce democratic reforms, Hong Kongers won't feel the need to take to the streets. They are pragmatic, reasonable people who would express themselves through democratic means if given the opportunity.
The international community should make clear on whose side they stand. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt got it right when he said that he understood the concerns of Hong Kong's people. ""I've never had to fight for my freedom. We can't take freedoms for granted,"" he said. ""My heart goes out to people who do have to fight for their freedoms and who are worried they could lose a very precious way of life."" He expressed support for the right to protest and urged Beijing to ""let Hong Kong be.""
He is right, and it is in everyone's interests for the rest of the world to take the same approach -- and for Beijing and Ms. Lam to listen.

World News: Hong Kong Students Boycott Class to Join Protests,"HONG KONG -- Government authorities had hoped that the unrest and upheaval of the past few months would recede after youthful protesters returned to school on Monday. Thousands of students proved them wrong by boycotting class.
Students at dozens of high schools across the city participated in protests, dressing in black or uniforms, carrying placards and forming human chains outside schools as a new term began.
At the alma mater of Carrie Lam, the city's chief executive, secondary school students held signs saying, ""Chief Executive: Are you willing to listen to the voices of the little sisters from your school?""
University students also began a boycott -- organizers estimated 30,000 people attended a rally at the Chinese University of Hong Kong -- while a general strike from a cross-section of industries had been called for Monday and Tuesday. Hundreds of schoolchildren rallied in the central business district, near a strike rally, while riot police patrolled subway stations during the morning commuter rush, making some arrests as protesters tried to obstruct train doors and disrupt passengers.
Tensions rose over the weekend, when the city saw some of its fiercest clashes between protesters and police. On Saturday, a fire raged near the city's police headquarters and police shot volleys of tear gas to disperse crowds, while access to the airport was effectively shut down for several hours on Sunday.
Although clashes were intense, tens of thousands peacefully occupied main roads Saturday to march in defiance of a police ban on a mass antigovernment rally, underscoring widespread public unhappiness with the city's government.
The arrests of eight opposition figures on Friday served only to galvanize demonstrators. Initially ignited by an extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to China for trial, the protests have since become a broader movement as the government has made few concessions.
As the city enters its fourth month of an uprising, there are no signs tensions will cool off. There are no public signs of dialogue between officials and protesters toward a resolution. Student leaders say they will escalate their actions on Sept. 13, if Mrs. Lam doesn't respond to their demands.
Brian, 15, said he was participating in his first protest because this one was focused on attracting secondary students like himself. ""I came straight from school because I have a responsibility to come out and express my views,"" he said. ""Hong Kong is my home. It's a beautiful city, but the beauty of it is slowly being destroyed by politicians.""
Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, the city's No. 2 ranking official, said the government opposed any class boycott, which would disrupt schools. ""Schools are absolutely not places for expressing political views or demands,"" Mr. Cheung said.

Last Chance to Save Freedom in Hong Kong,"I saw a photograph of a young man in Hong Kong, agitating for the right to be free, holding up an American flag amid a chaotic police assault (""Protests in Hong Kong Intensify As Beijing Cites Signs of Terrorism,"" Page One, Aug. 13). It is a harsh reminder that the U.S. -- despite its many faults, embattled as it may be -- is a beacon of freedom and inspiration for those who seek it. Are we serving those who seek freedom? Are we living up to our values or are we merely paying lip service to them?

Hong Kong's continuing civic unrest comes as much from economic structural problems as from political missteps. An entire generation of young Hong Kong professionals sees no possibility of ever owning even a small apartment after housing prices more than doubled in a decade. While Hong Kong's mountainous terrain and oceanside location have always limited available buildable land, demand and supply were reasonably in balance historically. What has overturned the balance is the relatively recent permission granted to mainland Chinese nationals to purchase property in Hong Kong, whether in their own name or through straw purchasers. With few investment opportunities available to retail investors in China, purchasing an apartment in Hong Kong's ever-inflating property market has been a rational move. No wonder that young Hong Kong workers with even above-average salaries are forced to rent from ""some guy from China.""

World News: Hong Kong's Peaceful Rally Adds Pressure --- Show of mass support raises stakes for city to resolve its biggest political crisis in years,"HONG KONG -- Pro-democracy demonstrators braved torrential rain to hold their largest rally in weeks, a show of mass support that reset the movement that opposes Beijing's tightening grip on the city and heaped pressure on officials to resolve its biggest political crisis in decades.
The peaceful procession was in contrast to recent weekends which have seen bloody battles between protesters and police and shuttered the city's airport last Monday.
Hundreds of thousands of mainly black-clad protesters of all ages rallied Sunday in Victoria Park, the starting point of some of the biggest demonstrations through 11 weekends of unrest, with crowds overflowing into the streets. Many marched 2 miles to the city's financial district, clogging major road arteries, in defiance of a police ban on any procession outside the park.
The scenes, which evoked two giant marches in early June, show that the movement is far from fizzling out, increasing pressure on local officials and their masters in Beijing who have struggled to contain the social unrest.
""With this huge number we can say that the people of Hong Kong have revitalized and reauthorized the campaign,"" said Bonnie Leung, vice convener of the Civil Human Rights Front, which organized the rally. ""The campaign has the support but the government doesn't.""
The organizers said more than 1.7 million people attended the overall rally, during which people passed into and out of the park. Police said there were 128,000 in the park at the peak period.
This weekend was the first in nearly a month without police firing tear gas. The calmer mood may offer an opportunity for officials to consider ways to initiate steps toward resolving the crisis, some analysts said.
Over the past few days, the Trump administration has spoken out more strongly about its concerns over the unrest. On Thursday, President Trump urged Chinese President Xi Jinping to ""humanely solve the problem in Hong Kong.""
Billed by organizers as peaceful and rational, Sunday's rally saw streets thronged for hours. Protesters chanted slogans demanding their rights, including chants of ""go, Hongkongers!""
By nightfall, tens of thousands occupied several lanes of public highway, before many dispersed. By midnight, a few dozen remained occupying a highway near the government's headquarters.
Two similarly massive protests in June against a proposed extradition bill -- which would have allowed people in Hong Kong to be sent to China for trial -- brought the city to a standstill. The city's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, suspended the controversial bill after the first protest, though she refused to withdraw it completely.
The campaign has since broadened into a wider movement calling for democratic reform and driven by anger at police use of force to counter protests and make arrests.
Neither Mrs. Lam, city officials nor those in Beijing have made any concessions since. Instead, they have focused their ire on thousands of hard-core protesters who have in recent weeks clashed more violently with police, with hundreds arrested.
The government said Sunday night it would ""begin sincere dialogue with the public, mend social rifts and rebuild social harmony when everything has calmed down.""
Protesters Sunday represented a broad cross-section of society, as parents brought young children and elderly citizens turned out to demonstrate their support.
""Today is like a reset of the movement,"" said a bespectacled university student surnamed Lam occupying Harcourt Road with his classmates Sunday. ""The government said it doesn't respond to violence, so now they have another chance.""

The Coming Hong Kong Crackdown,"Protesters in Hong Kong have delivered the most stunning rebuke to Chinese tyranny since the Tiananmen Square uprising of 1989. The question now, after eight weeks of demonstrations, is whether China's dictator, President Xi Jinping, will respond with the same brute military force used to crush that democracy movement 30 years ago. Serious observers worry the backlash is coming.
For Mr. Xi, who took power in 2013, the situation in Hong Kong presents an immediate threat to his domestic political legitimacy. State repression, bolstered by staggering levels of high-tech surveillance, has increased under his rule. In China's western province of Xinjiang, despite international protest, the regime has for two years been dishing out torture and forced political indoctrination to an estimated one million Uighur Muslims held in internment camps. Dealing harshly with Hong Kong's protest movement would remind the city's residents -- and the rest of China -- who's boss.
Mr. Xi's main concern is preventing the protest movement from spreading to the mainland. Faced with legislation that would allow extradition to China, Hong Kong's protesters reject the horrors of Beijing's one-party rule. That sentiment also simmers among the 1.4 billion people of the mainland, where Beijing deploys legions of censors and security agents to keep the population under control. Mainland Chinese may not agree with the protesters' methods or even their goals, but they visit Hong Kong by the millions every month. Many are aware that Hong Kong's people are defying Beijing and getting away with it.
It's possible Mr. Xi has lost patience with the idea of ""one country, two systems."" Under the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration -- a treaty deposited with the United Nations -- China promised that Hong Kong would enjoy ""a high degree of autonomy"" for 50 years after the handover in 1997. That declaration protecting Hong Kongers' rights and freedoms officially has 28 years left to run, but the two systems are obviously incompatible: One is free, the other isn't. If Mr. Xi deploys the People's Liberation Army to quell the protests, it would spell the end of ""one country, two systems"" in all but name.
Since the handover, a series of Chinese-appointed chief executives in Hong Kong have tried to impose laws designed to shut people up and force them to toe the party line. Hong Kong's people have no way to stop this via the ballot box; Beijing has cheated them of genuine democracy.
What would prevent Mr. Xi from ordering a crackdown? Hong Kong is one of China's most valuable financial assets. British colonial rule bequeathed Hong Kong a tradition of free trade and a dependable legal system, making it the most attractive business hub in Asia. The city of 7.5 million has one of the world's densest concentration of banks, which are the main interface between China's controlled currency and the U.S. dollar. Anything that scares away business, or prompts the U.S. to remove Hong Kong's special trading status, would hit China square in the wallet and could spark domestic political upheaval.
Then there's the reputational damage from a potentially monstrous spectacle played out on a world stage. Hong Kong is a global crossroads crammed with foreign nationals, including 80,000 Americans; the world would raise a fuss if the People's Liberation Army opened fire in the city center.
Mr. Xi's strategic calculations may be influenced by the embarrassing fact that the protests have grown even as China tries to tighten its grip. A young generation of savvy Hong Kongers is crowdsourcing tactics over the internet, gleaning lessons from recent uprisings in Ukraine and elsewhere. Unfortunately, Beijing's precedent for dealing with a protest on this scale is Tiananmen. The most defiant demonstrators for democracy were shot, jailed or exiled. The millions who marched or sympathized were terrorized into submission. While the slaughter of June 4, 1989, horrified much of the world, for China's Communist Party it was a success. The challenge to its power was swept away. After a brief scolding from the international community and the imposition of some short-lived U.S. sanctions, the world soon moved on.
Beijing has kept thousands of troops garrisoned in Hong Kong since the 1997 handover and is now laying the propaganda groundwork for a military crackdown. Last Wednesday China's Defense Ministry told the press it would be legitimate for Hong Kong's government to invite the People's Liberation Army to maintain public order. On Friday China's foreign ministry praised the army as ""a pillar"" of Hong Kong's ""long-term prosperity and stability."" Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam has largely dropped out of sight, but on Sunday she visited the Chinese army garrison in Hong Kong to attend a graduation ceremony at a military summer camp for youths.
If the U.S., Europe or any of the world's democracies have a plan to keep China's jackboot off Hong Kong's throat, now would be the time to try it out. Abandoning the freedom-loving people of Hong Kong in their hour of need would send Mr. Xi a dangerous message. He would view it as an invitation to send the People's Liberation Army on its next adventure.

World News: Hong Kong Death Inflames Tensions,"HONG KONG -- A university student died Friday after being comatose for days from injuries sustained near the scene of a clash between police and protesters, sparking fresh anger that has fueled antigovernment demonstrations and unrest for five months.
Chow Tsz-lok, a 22-year-old student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, fell down a level in a multistory parking garage early Monday morning, the government said, sustaining brain injuries that left him in a coma. Around the time of his fall, officers were nearby dispersing protesters using tear gas and rubber bullets.
The exact circumstances of Mr. Chow's fall are unclear, but the incident has spurred demands that police actions relating to his death be investigated, including whether officers caused a delay in the ambulance reaching the injured student. Police denied that.
The Hong Kong government expressed sorrow and regret about the death, and said the police crime unit was investigating.
The incident is likely to inflame tensions over the weekend, which had been expected to be relatively quiet after weeks of intense street battles.
After the news of his death, rallies and vigils were organized throughout Friday at various locations in the city. Online and on the streets, people demanded to know what had happened, and expressed sorrow for his death.
At the parking garage where Mr. Chow fell, several thousand people -- many dressed in black and wearing masks -- gathered in the evening to pay their respects, leaving white flowers and lighting candles at the scene.
Hundreds of black-clad protesters stayed behind to prepare for a fight with police, digging up bricks from sidewalks and building barricades.
Rallies elsewhere also turned into confrontations with police later in the night.
In some locations, demonstrators and bystanders shouted anti-police invective and retreated without a fight, while protesters elsewhere hurled bricks and petrol bombs at officers. Police fired tear gas and made a number of arrests.
Hong Kong's antigovernment protests were sparked by an extradition bill that, if passed, would have allowed criminal suspects in this semiautonomous city to be tried in mainland China, which has a more opaque legal system.
The bill has since been withdrawn, but the movement has snowballed into calls for greater democracy and a demand for a judge-led inquiry into how police have handled the protests.

Does Hong Kong Matter?,"Walking across the White House lawn a few weeks ago on his way to an event in Ohio, President Trump was asked by a reporter about the protests in Hong Kong. They have been constant since June, when authorities were about to pass a law that would have allowed Hong Kong residents and even foreign nationals to be extradited to the mainland for prosecution under China's legal system.
""Hong Kong is a part of China,"" Mr. Trump said. ""They'll have to deal with that themselves.""
This off-the-cuff remark by the president reflects the idea that the U.S. can't be expected to solve all the world's problems, a view sometimes summarized as America First. As well, Mr. Trump has been trying to negotiate a trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Mr. Trump no doubt thinks the Hong Kong protesters matter in some sense, but supporting them would put his one-to-one relationship with Mr. Xi and the trade deal at risk, and so ""they'll have to deal with that themselves.""
Be that as it may, one cannot help but wonder why these Hong Kong protests simply won't stop. The protesters aren't stupid. None of them want to be beaten bloody by the police or thrown for years into a Chinese prison. They know that if Xi Jinping merely nods his head, they're going to be crushed. Yet day after day they keep showing up.
By coincidence, a similar protest took place Saturday in Moscow for the fifth straight weekend. Some 50,000 Russians took to the streets, as they have recurrently during the presidency of Vladimir Putin.
The weekend's images from Hong Kong and Moscow were also eerily similar: Police in helmets and often thick, black jackets beat protesters with batons and dragged them to police wagons.
As in Hong Kong, the Russian protesters know the stakes are high. Some of their opposition leaders, such as Boris Nemtsov, have ended up dead.
In Hong Kong, the proximate cause of the protests is the extradition-to-China bill. In Moscow, it is about demands for fair city-council elections.
At that level, it almost does sound like something that, however difficult, they do need to work out themselves. But it is also hard to see these massive, daily protests in Hong Kong and not recognize that they really are about one word: freedom.
Someone once sang that ""freedom's just another word,"" and maybe today it is. One casualty of the relentless U.S. political slog is that some important ideas -- such as justice, racism, equality and respect -- get so beaten into the ground, become so hackneyed, that one feels almost embarrassed to use the words. Justice, freedom, uh-huh, click.
Does Hong Kong matter? Ultimately and unhappily, the Hong Kong protesters may get not much more than admiration from the rest of the world. But we would do well to stare hard into those faces filling screens and think about the implications of their all-or-nothing fight for freedom.
Hardly any of them look older than 25. In Moscow last weekend, a young woman said, ""I am 20 years old, and in my entire life there has not been a single day of freedom."" Virtually no one living in the hyperpoliticized U.S. has to think that on any day of their lives.
Freedom is normally discussed in the context of mass movements or revolutions such as ours in America long ago. Let freedom ring. Yet a better understanding of the impulse for freedom is not primarily as the force behind mass movements but as a basic human instinct, like breathing. Let me first be free, and then, yes, we can deal with the rest ourselves.
No one should more instantly understand this than Donald Trump.
The individual impulse toward freedom was the reason many voted for the improbable Trump candidacy in 2016. People were feeling increasingly hemmed in by their government and the prevailing culture -- told too often what they should do and how they should think about the most personal matters.
Others thought voting for Mr. Trump was irrational. But like the Hong Kong protesters, choosing a seemingly irrational course looked to many in the U.S. like the best available bust-out option. That's what Brexit is, too -- an arguably irrational lunge for freedom.
Mr. Trump and his supporters, however, should recognize that it isn't going to be possible to put a fence around freedom. You don't haul little kids nearly 2,000 miles across Mexico for nothing more than a job.
Yes, we ""don't do nation-building anymore."" But when nations start to collapse -- as in Central America, Africa or the Middle East -- or when governments in places like China or Russia try to impose smothering systems on people, eruptions and flows of individuals seeking freedom will be inevitable.
It's complicated, there are practical limits, and national self-interest matters. But will they really ""have to deal with that themselves""? The United States, of all places, can do better than that. Hong Kong matters.

Disqualifying Joshua Wong,"Hong Kongers would rather express their political will at the ballot box than in protests. They broke a record as they surged to register for the Nov. 24 district council elections, but Beijing infuriated them again this week when its agents in Hong Kong barred democracy activist Joshua Wong from running.
Mr. Wong believes Hong Kong people should decide the city's future but says that ""supporting democratic self-determination does not mean supporting Hong Kong's independence."" Officials nonetheless say Mr. Wong is a separatist and claim he can't fulfill a district councilor's obligation to uphold the law, which recognizes Hong Kong as a part of China.
On cue, China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office issued a statement praising his disqualification, while the state-run Xinhua news service wrote that Mr. Wong ""had to pay the price for causing chaos in Hong Kong and opposing China.""
This supports Mr. Wong's claim that he was ""targeted by the central government,"" and it is further proof that the Chinese Communist Party has no intention of respecting Hong Kong's legal autonomy. Beijing already chooses Hong Kong's chief executive and most of its lawmakers, but at least the people directly elect 452 of the 479 district councilors. These representatives deal primarily with neighborhood issues like parks, bus stops and community events.
But they also hold some symbolic power because they fill a few Legislative Council seats and cast 117 of the 1,200 election committee votes that determine who becomes chief executive. Disqualifying Mr. Wong from even this limited role adds oil to the fire as Hong Kong's protests enter their sixth month.
Meanwhile, on Thursday, economic data showed Hong Kong has officially slipped into a recession. Beijing's latest assault on the rule of law in Hong Kong will deepen the crisis."
World News: Military Monitors Hong Kong Unrest,"BEIJING -- China's military is closely monitoring political unrest in Hong Kong, a defense spokesman said, describing recent violence there as intolerable and citing a law that permits the city's government to ask Chinese armed forces to help maintain public order.
At a briefing, a reporter from Hong Kong asked Senior Col. Wu Qian how the defense ministry viewed the situation in Hong Kong and how it would respond to pro-independence activists there.
""We have been following closely the development of the situation in Hong Kong,"" especially the violence around the government's liaison office in the city on July 21, Col. Wu said.
As to whether the Chinese military would intervene, he said there were ""clear and specific instructions"" in the garrison law governing the Chinese army's presence in Hong Kong.

Strife Dims Hong Kong Property Boom,"Hong Kong's formidable property market is straining, as protest pressures add to those created by an escalating U.S.-China trade spat and slowing global growth.
In the past two months, shares in big real-estate companies have dropped, and a marquee land sale in a much-hyped redevelopment area has fallen through. Home values have edged lower, and some analysts now expect prices, after marching upward for many years, to be flat for 2019.
Trade tensions and signs of slowing growth weigh on commercial-property prices in other world cities as well. But property plays an outsize role in Hong Kong's economy, and real estate is one of the most important sectors in the local stock market.
The market value of the city's big four developers -- CK Asset Holdings Ltd., Henderson Land Development Co., New World Development Co. and Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. -- fell more than $16 billion in the one-month period ended Aug. 26. Because the major developers are also landlords, with investment portfolios that span shopping malls, hotels and office buildings, they are exposed in more than one way to a downturn.
The city has been hit by a ""perfect storm"" of trade tensions and spiraling protester-police clashes, Wharf Real Estate Investment Co. Chairman Stephen Ng told media earlier this month. He said sales at the company's two flagship malls, Times Square and Harbour City, had suffered.
In the commercial-property market, second-quarter sales were down 6.2% from the quarter before, to $21.1 billion Hong Kong dollars ($2.69 billion), excluding land sales, according to real estate services firm CBRE.
Citing social unrest and economic instability, Chinese developer Goldin Financial Holdings Ltd. in June walked away from a $1.4 billion purchase of commercial land.
The impact on the residential sector has been smaller. At the city's top 10 private housing estates, homeowners sold 19 apartments in the first four weekends of August, four more than in the same period a year earlier, Centaline Property Agency data show. The company said sales picked up during the most recent weekend, aided by anticipation of persistently low interest rates and after some homeowners reduced prices.
The realtor's Centa-City Leading Index, a gauge of used home prices, has fallen by 1.1% in seven weeks, after hitting a record high in late June.
Louis Chan Wing-kit, Centaline's Asia-Pacific vice chairman, said many prospective buyers had canceled tours, as protests disrupted transport and dented investor sentiment.
Danny Lo, a 48-year-old Hong Konger who has moved to Canada, said he put his apartment in Kowloon's Hung Hom district on the market at the end of June and has watched interest diminish as the protests escalated. By mid-July, he said, demand was dead, with no more viewings and only a couple of phone inquiries. He said he is considering dropping the price.
The protests, sparked by a bill before the city's legislature that would have let China extradite suspects from Hong Kong and prosecute them on the mainland, have been fed by economic grievances, including concerns about inequality and the cost of living.
Home prices are part of that. Hong Kong has long been the world's least-affordable residential market, research firm Demographia says, and last year the average apartment price, at $7.17 million Hong Kong dollars, was more than 20 times median annual household income. Prices have more than quintupled since 2003, when an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome rattled the city and its economy. The rally was boosted by low interest rates, limited supply and hefty demand from mainland Chinese buyers as China's economy boomed.

"World News: Twitter, Facebook Suspend Accounts","Twitter Inc. and Facebook Inc. suspended accounts they believe to be part of a Chinese effort to undermine antigovernment protests in Hong Kong, marking the first time the companies have pointed to China as a source of disinformation campaigns, company representatives said on Monday.
Twitter said it took down 936 accounts linked to a ""significant state-backed information operation"" originating in China.
""These accounts were deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong, including undermining the legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement on the ground,"" Twitter wrote in a blog post.
Facebook said that following a tip from Twitter, it removed five accounts along with seven pages, with a reach of more than 15,000 accounts, as well as three groups that included more than 2,000 members. ""Although the people behind this activity attempted to conceal their identities, our investigation found links to individuals associated with the Chinese government,"" Facebook said.
Facebook and Twitter are blocked in China by a government-controlled national firewall. That suggests the latest information operations were likely part of a government-sanctioned effort to influence global opinion, said Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab.
""They are testing what is effective as well as what is accepted or not pushed back on by the international community,"" he said.
Hong Kong has seen a wave of protests in the past two months as a pro-democracy movement stepped up pressure on the city's Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam, to enter into dialogue to resolve the crisis.
Pressure has been mounting for Facebook and Twitter to counter state-sponsored disinformation campaigns after accusations that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The companies said in January that they had removed hundreds of fake accounts from Iran and Venezuela.
Twitter also said on Monday that it would stop running advertising from state media and that it had removed at least one widely circulated advertisement by China's state-run Xinhua News Agency that criticized the protest movement.
Even without advertising, China's state news organizations have considerable reach on Twitter. Xinhua has 12.6 million Twitter followers.
Representatives of the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., didn't respond to a request for comment.
Facebook said it shared its analysis with law enforcement and industry partners. It said it took down the pages, groups and accounts ""based on their behavior, not the content they posted.""
The company said it was making progress identifying behavior that isn't permitted on its site, but called it an ""ongoing challenge.""
Twitter said the suspended accounts represented the most active portions of a coordinated state-backed disinformation campaign against the protesters. The accounts, it said, are part of a larger network of about 200,000 accounts that it suspended ""before they were substantially active on the service.""
Twitter said some of the Chinese accounts were using unblocked internet addresses originating in China.

"Quiet Support Aids Hong Kong Protests --- Backing of older, professional people helps explain longevity of youth-led movement","HONG KONG -- Most nights, when Hong Kong fogs up with tear gas and black-shirted young protesters find themselves on the run from police, a middle-aged manager named Mr. Chan drives his silver Toyota four-door into the fray to ferry them home.
After dropping off one group, he returns for more, carrying water and a bag of T-shirts for a disguise. He can log 100 miles shuttling between conflict zones and the outlying apartment towers where many protesters live.
He's part of what's known as ""the school bus"" -- code for a vast underground of getaway cars typically driven by older, middle-class Hong Kongers who want to support the younger generation protesting in the streets. One of the encrypted chat groups organizing the rides, also called ""after school pickup,"" connects drivers it calls ""parents"" with protester ""children."" The group has some 21,000 subscribers. Tens of thousands more subscribe to other groups.
China and its handpicked leaders in Hong Kong have argued that a silent majority of citizens opposes the demonstrators who have confronted police, blocked roads and disrupted airport travel during a summer of protests against Beijing's tightening grip. A closer look suggests a vast swath of the city is quietly helping to keep it going.
Largely out of the public eye, behind-the-scenes supporters have sprung up across Hong Kong to furnish protesters with rides home, gas masks, food money and funds for legal defense. There's a doctors group offering anonymous examinations to injured protesters wary of being treated at public hospitals.Another group offers to listen to young protesters who don't feel comfortable talking about what they are going through with their parents.
""You don't have to face it alone,"" the group advertises in protester chat rooms. Its administrator goes by @cometomama.
Since June, activists have raised roughly $10 million in small donations to pay protester legal fees and medical bills. The fund is called the ""612 Humanitarian Relief Fund"" after the date of fierce clashes when some protesters were charged with crimes that can carry a sentence up to 10 years, according to Margaret Ng, one of its organizers.
""It is significant because it shows how many people in Hong Kong want to show their support in some way but can't get out and protest,"" said Ms. Ng, 71, a prominent Hong Kong lawyer who served years in its legislature.
Crowdfunding has raised millions to buy full page ads in international newspapers explaining the protesters' cause to garner global support.
""We're just neighbors getting together to do what we can,"" said Mr. Chan, the ride-giver, who said he wants to protect the future of Hong Kong for his own child. As he spoke by telephone, ""Stand With Hong Kong,"" a nightly 10 p.m. cheer for the protests, echoed from the balconies of nearby towers. ""We are like intersecting social circles that overlap and overlap until we reach the goal, like a human chain.""
The public got a glimpse of the size of that chain early this month. When authorities shut down public transport links to Hong Kong's remote airport and left protesters there stranded, so many drivers responded to pleas for rides that they snarled traffic on a major highway. Hours into the rescue, there were more drivers than protesters. Some cars went home empty.
This support helps explain the durability of a movement that deepened this summer in opposition to a law allowing extraditions to China. The protests have persisted while police stepped up arrests and unleashed water cannons to restore order.
The support also undercuts arguments circulated by Beijing that the protests are sustained by provocateurs from the U.S. and elsewhere.
The supporters' work is covert because they fear they could be accused of abetting illegal gatherings or other crimes. They also fear China could target them for retribution. Already, Beijing has pressured companies such as Hong Kong's flagship airline Cathay Pacific to fire suspected protest supporters or participants.
Many come from the comfortable sectors of Hong Kong society. Take a housewife with long hair and a prominent diamond studded wedding band who asked to be called Mrs. D, the initial of one of her names. She lives in the city's Kowloon Tong neighborhood, a posh enclave long home to Hong Kong's privileged, including the late actor Bruce Lee.
""You can print that I live in Kowloon Tong,"" she said. ""I want people to know that people like me are supporting the movement.""
Some nights after following the skirmishes on TV, she goes out to make school bus runs with her husband in their luxury sedan. She first checks in with one of the ""school bus"" channels on the anonymous messaging app Telegram that connects drivers and protesters using lightly veiled codes.
""Have all the children gotten home yet?"" asked the administrator of one school bus group around 1:30 a.m. on Sept. 7, a night of violent showdowns in the Mong Kok neighborhood. ""If anyone would like us to pick you up from school today. If anyone wants a ride home, contact admin,"" the group repeated at 2 a.m.
In July, Mrs. D was moved by reports that some young protesters weren't eating much during the long days and nights scuffling with police. The student-aged protesters often don't have enough money for transportation, gear like helmets and food. Some parents cut off their allowances to keep them from going out, she said.
In a matter of weeks, Mrs. D collected $25,000 worth of McDonald's gift certificates and prepaid metro cards largely by hitting up neighbors.
Many protesters are ashamed to accept donations, she said, so she and her friends decided to present them as ""gifts from an aunt."" They staple the coupons into packs with handwritten notes and little hearts. Mrs. D said she hand delivers coupons to protesters she met at rallies or through encrypted chats. The protesters redistribute the coupons through networks of their own.
""You are not alone,"" read one note. ""We are giving you our energy.""
Some money has come available for arrested protesters who choose to flee, according to two protesters who were offered money and two donors who know about the practice. The protesters, who fear long prison terms, typically have fled to Taiwan.
Major logistical efforts go into providing front-line protesters with the gear they use to protect themselves from tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons and less-lethal projectiles like bean bags deployed since the demonstrations began.
A full set of gear -- respirator masks and filters from 3M, yellow construction helmets from Korel, goggles and gloves -- can cost $50 or more. Replacing top-of-the-line air filters on a mask after heavy use can cost between $22 and $35.
The equipment is difficult to find anymore in Hong Kong's shops but is in ample supply in the streets. It is common at protest staging areas to see stacks of helmets still in their plastic wrapping or boxes of shop goggles left out for the taking.
Pro-Beijing journalists, businessmen and politicians have cited the seemingly endless supply of apparently new gear as evidence the movement has the backing of anti-China organizations, potentially with funding from the U.S.
""I was told a few vans would pull up behind the front lines, and out would come helmets, masks, you know, first class equipment,"" said Alan Zeman, a prominent Hong Kong property developer and supporter of the local government who said he believes protester funding could be coming covertly from the U.S. ""They are kids, but they are very well prepared with masks and all that. There is an organization behind it.""
A supporter who called himself Mr. Ko, a top regional executive at a global company, said he spends much of his spare time acquiring and distributing such gear.
He is part of an informal group of around 100 people connected through Telegram who share information about sourcing, shipping and distribution. They import the gear from Taiwan, where they believe suppliers would never give their names to police.
""We only buy a few sets each, to stay under the radar,"" he said. ""But if we each buy five, that's 500 sets.""
An engineer in his mid-30s whose surname is Cheung brings in far more. He works at a construction site, so he has a plausible reason to buy gear in bulk. Right now he said he has six boxes of full-face 3M gas masks stacked at the site ready for the next big march.
He stays connected via membership in a recommendation-only chat group of engineers -- many groups require an existing member to vouch for a new one to fend off police infiltrators. The group discusses buying gear and other engineering topics, including possibly using carbon fiber to make shields for the protesters.
Mr. Ko delivers the gear to protesters that he knows a few days before a demonstration. ""I tell parents it's similar to what you face with kids and sex,"" Mr. Ko said. ""You know they are going to do it anyway, so you give them protection. We know they are going to protest, so let's give them protection.""
Mr. Ko believes the protesters prefer a more expensive model of air filter for masks in part because of the model's striking hot pink color. ""They really want the pink ones, so we get it for them,"" he said.
Older Hong Kongers supported past protests, too. They supplied food and aid during a 79-day sit-in by students demanding democracy in 2014.
Their support is more active now, said Chris, a trim man in his mid-50s who owns a logistics and shipping business. Back in 2014, he made the local news for carrying wood planks in his business suit after work to help build desks so school-age protesters could continue their studies.
Now he said he often stands near where the masked protesters confront police, in part to see if they need anything.
""I feel I owe these kids a lot,"" he said.
His parents fled mainland China after the Communist Revolution with nothing, and built new lives in what was then a British colony. The U.K. returned the territory to China in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" agreement that promised Hong Kong a measure of autonomy until 2047.
That arrangement was challenged this year by a proposed law allowing extradition to China. The bill, which followed a number of other erosions of Hong Kong's rule of law, sparked the current protests. Chris saw itas the death of one country, two systems and Hong Kong's way of life.
""This is a fight about freedom and democracy versus authoritarianism and communism,"" he said.
On June 12, when tens of thousands of protesters massed outside the legislative building to prevent lawmakers from passing the bill, he went, too.
Expecting police to disperse the crowd with pepper spray, he went from store to store buying every umbrella he could to be used as shields. He purchased at least fifty and sometimes paid just half price, which he said reflects the level of local support.
The legislators were forced to suspend the vote on the law, and a summer of confrontation kicked into high gear.
The protesters have now organized into self-directed teams ranging from a handful to a couple of dozen youths. Chris said he forged links with a representative of one of these teams and basically adopted them. From there he met others. He provides them money to buy protective gear, food and other things they need.
Of all the methods of support, the school bus brings the older generation of supporters into closest proximity with the young protesters. Sometimes it unites father and son.
A 23-year-old accounting school graduate called Tim sometimes goes out on school bus runs with his father after making it home from protesting himself. His father drives while Tim assures the protesters his middle-aged dad isn't a cop. ""This experience has drawn us together,"" he said.
The school bus started because protesters needed ways to get from marches on Hong Kong island back to their homes on the Kowloon side of Victoria Harbour. It has become more important now that authorities are shutting metro stations early, leaving protesters wandering the streets and vulnerable to arrest.
A protester called Desmond first asked for a free school bus ride on July 21, after word spread that protesters had been beaten in a subway station. He was running from club-wielding police that night in the city and needed to get back across the harbor. He asked the anonymous administrator of one of the school bus chat rooms to help him.
The administrator told him to go to an address on the edge of noisy bar district, where a bunch of cars waiting around wouldn't attract attention. Desmond found 20 cars lined up, their drivers calling out destinations such as ""West Kowloon!"" and ""East Kowloon!""
Once a driver picks up a protester, the intergenerational chitchat is kept to a minimum, said Mr. Chan.
""If you start talking too much and asking questions, they start to get nervous that you are a cop,"" he said. ""I just drive and let them off wherever they want.""

NBA: Adam Silver's Sleepless Nights --- The season begins after an unsettled showdown with China. Where does the league go from here?,"He slept very little over there. Adam Silver has been stateside for a bit now, and yet the timeline still feels blurry, in the way it can when you're back from traveling on the other side of the world. He knew he didn't do much sleeping, as the NBA tried to diplomatically ease its way out of an unexpected, contentious showdown with China.
""I'm not a good sleeper to begin with,"" the 57-year-old basketball commissioner admitted. The 12-hour time difference between Shanghai, where he had been, and NBA HQ in New York City, meant Silver was staying up late to talk to advisers back in the U.S. ""It didn't afford much of an opportunity to sleep,"" Silver said Monday, in an interview from the NBA league office.
He wasn't looking for sympathy, nor would he get any. He came home, knocked around. The Lakers and the Nets managed to play two exhibition games in China, and yet, everything else felt sideways. Their host was simmering over a deleted tweet in support of Hong Kong protesters from Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey. Back in the U.S., the NBA was taking ferocious criticism like it seldom ever had -- Ted Cruz and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez agreed on little, but they agreed the NBA had bungled China.
Silver was at the bottom of the pile-on, an unfamiliar spot. He'd been ""The Good Commissioner"" -- the one who'd expelled Donald Sterling; who gracefully navigated between players and owners; who seemed to have a preternatural handle of the moment and mood. Now Silver was being slammed as a hypocrite -- the leader of a progressive league which had caved to authoritarian pressure when its business was on the line.
Criticism came with the job, he got that. But Silver took issue with the idea that the NBA had abandoned its principles; they'd never apologized for Morey's tweet, they'd stood behind his right to expression, he said.
""I've never hidden from the fact that we are also a business, and that many of the situations we've dealt with are highly complex,"" he said. ""I've tried to avoid playing politics and adhere to our values. I felt in this case that one of our core values, freedom of expression, was adhered to.""
""But I would also say that one [value] that seems to be used against me is this notion of respect. That's always been one of our core values. To show respect for the people of China -- to me, that was then twisted and turned into an apology. I think respect is respect. I continue to be a believer in diplomacy, and diplomacy doesn't necessarily mean that you park your core values at the curb. But it means showing sensitivity.""
He acknowledged the league had been trying to thread a needle, especially early on. Maybe it had been too careful. He understood there are those who want the NBA out of China, period. But the volume around the debate bothered him.
""People don't seem to be listening to each other in the U.S.,"" he said. ""There's a part of me -- it's as much frustration as a citizen, I would say, less in my capacity as commissioner of the NBA -- people don't get through even a full tweet. That's what their attention span is. It's the first five words of the tweet. It's not even the whole sentence.""
""I just look at the political landscape around this country, and I would again turn back to sports. [This] is an opportunity to talk about issues that people, through sports, might otherwise not have interest in. What's happening globally? What's happening with our relationship in China? Maybe some positive can come out of that.""
He had to know that was a surreal silver lining to see -- perhaps this could be a teachable moment -- after such a fraught trip. The issue had chased them back home. Last week, it was LeBron James's turn at the bottom of the pile, after a news conference in which he seemed to tweak Morey for starting up this whole mess. There had been protests in support of Hong Kong demonstrators inside NBA arenas, including one down the street in Brooklyn. The NBA remains off the air on China's CCTV, a situation Silver acknowledged remains ""raw.""
This was not the discussion he preferred to kick off a season. And there is excitement about the new year: the starry battle in Los Angeles between James's Lakers and Kawhi Leonard's Clippers; the thrilling Giannis Antetokounmpo in Milwaukee; Kyrie Irving resettled in Brooklyn, waiting to be joined by the rehabilitating Kevin Durant.
A knee injury to New Orleans's rookie comet Zion Williamson is a bummer -- after surgery, he may miss up to two months -- but plenty of intrigue remains. Perhaps the most delicious possibility is that Morey's Rockets, who traded for human cannonball Russell Westbrook, are a serious contender. How wild would that be, after all this, Silver on stage with Morey at season's end?
It's a long way off, all of it. For the commissioner, there was much work to do -- to assess, repair, and adapt to an unsettled new landscape. There is unlikely to be any resolution with China that won't provoke some form of blowback. ""It's unavoidable for businesses of any kind in this day and age,"" he said. ""It's virtually impossible to stay on the sidelines. Especially when you have a young fan base, as we do. They expect you to take positions. Incidentally, I've pointed out many times that taking positions doesn't necessarily mean that everyone is going to agree with you.""
He was off to Toronto for a championship ceremony for the Raptors, Canada's first, but none of this was going away. Adam Silver knows that. Maybe somewhere in there, he will sleep.

"U.S. News -- Capital Account: Despite Trade Truce, U.S.-China Chasm Widens","When President Trump first hit China with tariffs more than a year ago, he was pursuing narrowly defined, transactional goals: a smaller bilateral trade deficit and better treatment of U.S. companies inside China.
But the trade war has since blossomed into a broader, deeper ideological conflict. Events in the last week show that the two economic superpowers, though reaching a truce in their trade war, are drifting closer to a new Cold War.
From China's 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization until 2017, the U.S. and China moved toward greater integration and engagement. Skeptics of that process fell into three camps: economic hawks unhappy with China's treatment of foreign firms, national security hawks suspicious of its geopolitical designs, and human-rights hawks exercised by its intolerance of democracy and dissent. Historically, these three camps have been separate and only intermittently influential.
Events in the last year have changed that. Business disenchantment with China and Mr. Trump's trade war empowered economic hawks. They joined forces with national security hawks who see China's economic and military rivalry as inseparable. Separately, China's treatment of its Muslim minority in Xinjiang and Western businesses like the National Basketball Association, and the Hong Kong protests gave human-rights hawks a voice.
Events in the last week starkly illustrate how this broad opposition is widening the split between the two countries. The so-called trade minideal is most notable for what it didn't do: roll back any tariffs.
A year ago, the consensus of outside analysts was that the U.S. and China would reach a broad agreement resolving their main concerns. Now, the consensus is that they won't.
""I think the Chinese really don't believe a full-fledged agreement is possible,"" said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Not only do [China and the U.S.] have limited trust in each other, neither side seems to be in a position where they desperately need a deal.""
Arthur Kroeber, head of research at Gavekal Dragonomics, a China-focused research service, said in a report that any eventual deal won't include ""any substantive measures to get China to change the core economic practices that the U.S. finds objectionable"" or ""blunt ongoing U.S. efforts to constrain the flows of U.S. technology to China.""
Underlining this last point, the U.S. last week added 28 Chinese entities to a blacklist that cuts off access to U.S. suppliers of crucial inputs due to Beijing's repression of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. ""I do not recall the entity list ever being used to pursue a human-rights agenda,"" said Dan Rosen, a veteran China analyst at the Rhodium Group.
Mr. Rosen sees that as evidence of the increased sway of hawks in the professional national security establishment who have long sought to ""lock in the stark sense of contrast between American and Chinese values.""
The NBA controversy has further fueled the hawks' case that the U.S. and Chinese systems are incompatible. After Daryl Morey, general manager of the NBA's Houston Rockets, tweeted support for the Hong Kong protesters, Chinese online stores dropped the team's merchandise, Chinese television stopped showing its games, and its Chinese corporate partners suspended cooperation.
Mr. Morey deleted the tweet and apologized, the NBA called the comments inappropriate and Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James said Mr. Morey was ""misinformed."" That climbdown triggered blowback from both Democrats and Republicans who saw China using its economic leverage to censor American speech. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, in a tweet accused the NBA of throwing Mr. Morey ""under the bus to please the Communist Chinese Govt. Disgusting.""
Mr. Rubio embodies the shift in American opinion. He has warned the administration against relaxing restrictions on Chinese companies accused of stealing U.S. technology or spying on Americans, pressed the federal civil-service retirement fund not to track stock indexes that include Chinese stocks, and sponsored bipartisan legislation tying favorable economic treatment of Hong Kong to its continued autonomy from Beijing.
That pressure makes it difficult for the administration to relax the many restrictions it has imposed on China. Daniel Ahn, chief U.S. economist at BNP Paribas, estimated the contribution of those restrictions to the drop in China-U.S. trade and converted that effect to a tariff equivalent. Including all imposed tariffs, the effective tariff on China is 28%, compared with 4% just after it joined the WTO.
So don't let the minideal fool you: Beneath the surface, the split between the U.S. and China is widening.

World News: Hong Kong Protesters Head to the Airport --- Unrest greets visitors as prolonged conflict hits the city's tourism and retail sectors,"HONG KONG -- Travelers to Hong Kong were greeted by more than a thousand black-clad protesters as antigovernment demonstrators took their grievances to the airport ahead of another weekend of planned unrest that is starting to hurt the city's economy.
Eight weeks of upheaval in Hong Kong, sparked by a proposed bill that would allow criminal suspects to be extradited to China, is taking a toll on tourism and retail sectors in the semiautonomous city that already is suffering from trade frictions between the U.S. and China.
While there were no reports of flight disruptions on Friday, travel agents have blamed the protests for canceled tour visits, and bookings for short-haul passenger flights from many Asian countries are down. Concerns are growing about a broader economic slowdown in the city, which has thrived as a peaceful base for banks and multinational companies.
""If the situation isn't resolved politically, it could have a long-term effect"" on Hong Kong's role as a financial center, said Lee Cheuk-yan, general secretary of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions and a supporter of the protest movement.
Friday's protests focused on an attack last weekend in the district of Yuen Long by a mob targeting suspected protesters, which injured dozens and prompted an outcry against allegedly slow police response.
More than a thousand people, mostly dressed in black and covered with masks, sat for hours Friday in the arrival hall at the Hong Kong airport, chanting ""Free Hong Kong,"" ""Hong Kong is not China"" and ""Keep on, Hong Kong people."" They handed passengers leaflets in languages including Japanese, Korean and Spanish.
Hong Kong Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung apologized Friday for the police's handling of the incident in Yuen Long.
The unrest has damped a recent boom in Hong Kong tourism, which benefited from the launch of new infrastructure projects in 2018, including a high-speed rail system. Yiu Si-wing, a lawmaker who represents the city's tourism sector, said some tourist agencies have received inquiries about possible cancellations of their corporate trips or study tours to Hong Kong in August.
""It's a disappointing season so far for the tourism industry,"" he said. ""The violence and brutal attacks have made many prospective tourists feel unsafe to travel to the city.""
Tourism had seen a robust growth rate of 15% in the first five months of 2019, but slowed to 8.5% following the outbreak of demonstrations in June.
Fears of growing lawlessness and violence in the usually peaceful city prompted some businesses including Apple Inc. to close stores early one day this week.
To allay concerns about Hong Kong's safety, the city's secretary for commerce and economic development, Edward Yau, issued a letter to foreign countries' diplomatic consulates and international chambers of commerce in Hong Kong this week. ""The vast majority of people taking part in processions do so in a peaceful and orderly manner,"" he wrote.
This week, the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, whose members consist of local and international businesses, called on the government to fully withdraw the extradition bill.
Elaine Jamieson, an interior designer originally from the United Kingdom who has lived in Hong Kong for more than 30 years, was at the airport to pick up her godson Friday. The 55 year old said she is proud of those who took the protests to one of the world's busiest airports. ""Everybody needs to know what's going on,"" she said.
Another mass march is planned for Saturday in Yuen Long. Though police didn't approve a permit for the event, many demonstrators are still expected to attend, raising the specter of more clashes.

"Houston, We Have a China Problem","China has become comfortable pushing around American companies -- a little too comfortable. Its boycott of the National Basketball Association's Houston Rockets, announced Sunday to muzzle support for mass protests in Hong Kong, has alerted Americans to the threat posed by China's bullying in a way that intellectual-property theft never could.
""Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,"" tweeted sports-analytics whiz Daryl Morey, the Rockets' general manager, on Sunday. Within a few hours, Mr. Morey had deleted the tweet, team owner Tilman Fertitta had disavowed the general manager's views, and China had cut off the Rockets commercially. The NBA soon released a statement in English that affirmed both Beijing's concerns and the league's support for ""individuals educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them."" The league released a different statement in Chinese, which began: ""We are extremely disappointed in the inappropriate comments by the General Manager.""
By Sunday night, Mr. Morey was reduced to groveling: ""I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event,"" he tweeted. That's nonsense, but don't blame him. He can't take on the Chinese Communist Party alone -- it isn't a fair fight.
China Central Television and People's Daily, the party's mouthpiece, editorialized against Mr. Morey. CCTV's sports channel said it won't air Rockets games anymore. The Chinese company Tencent, which holds exclusive digital rights to NBA games in China, said it will stop showing the team online, taking with it the 490 million fans who watched NBA games on its platforms last season. Next, two Chinese sponsors dropped the Rockets, the highly popular former team of Shanghai native Yao Ming, and the Chinese Basketball Association ceased all cooperation with it. That was China's first-day response.
In dealing with Western businesses, intimidation is China's policy of first resort. It worked this summer against luxury brands Versace, Givenchy and Coach, which were forced to apologize after issuing T-shirts that didn't describe Taipei, Hong Kong and Macau as part of China. It also works against American academics, cultural associations and even movie makers. China uses blunt pressure to restrict Americans' speech, and gets away with it.
Why not take a hard foul? America could retaliate for the Rockets boycott by revoking visas for visiting Chinese gymnastics teams or orchestras. If China cancels this week's NBA preseason games scheduled for Shanghai and Shenzhen, USA Basketball could schedule scrimmages in Taiwan.
One encouraging sign is that the NBA's kowtowing has drawn harsh criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. ""In pursuit of big $$,"" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz tweeted, ""the @nba is shamefully retreating."" Mr. Cruz's 2018 Democratic challenger, Beto O'Rourke, echoed the sentiment: ""The only thing the NBA should be apologizing for is their blatant prioritization of profits over human rights. What an embarrassment.""
The Chinese bullies no doubt chuckle at every obsequious statement from Houston and the NBA, but Americans aren't laughing. Many are feeling something like the stirrings of nationalism, not taking kindly to being pushed around by a foreign dictatorship. America is waking up to an unpleasant reality: This is how China operates. Now it's up to the Trump administration to rally Americans around a strategic response. Even if the West can't change China, we shouldn't let China change us.

World News: Hong Kong Clashes Grow More Violent --- Pro-democracy official has part of ear bitten off in 22nd weekend of demonstrations,"HONG KONG -- A pro-democracy politician was among the victims of a brutal attack during the 22nd weekend of protests in Hong Kong, as the city becomes increasingly mired in a cycle of violence.
An unidentified man -- who local media reported had gone on a stabbing spree -- grabbed District Councilor Andrew Chiu by the neck and shoulders, biting a part of his left ear off.
A crowd of onlookers cornered and attacked the man before police arrived. Mr. Chiu is the latest in a string of pro-democracy figures to be attacked in Hong Kong.
In another district, pro-democracy protesters smashed a ticketing counter inside a subway station and were chased by riot police into a bustling shopping mall. Protesters and mall-goers flashed laser beams at armed officials in response.
The violence on Sunday followed demonstrations a day earlier in which tens of thousands of people took to the streets, while police fired tear gas and water cannons in an effort to disperse the crowds.
""Hong Kong seems to be trapped in a weekly cycle of unrest and repression, conflict between protesters and authorities, with no clear endgame on either side,"" said Antony Dapiran, a lawyer and the author of a forthcoming book on the protests. ""The protesters are not giving up as the government had hoped, while the government is taking no action at all to resolve the crisis.""
The monthslong movement was sparked by an extradition bill that would have allowed people in this semiautonomous Chinese city to be tried in mainland China's more opaque legal system. The government withdrew the bill in October, as demonstrations became more violent, though the movement has snowballed into a call for greater democracy and freedoms.
Those demands include a direct election for the city's leader -- currently selected by a pro-Beijing election committee -- amnesty for arrested demonstrators and an independent inquiry into alleged police misconduct against protesters.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam softened her tone on a police inquiry in October, saying she would consider it after assessing the results of a continuing probe by an independent police complaints committee.
Mrs. Lam is scheduled to meet Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng in Beijing on Wednesday.
The visit comes after the central government in Beijing said it planned to ramp up efforts to integrate Hong Kong with the mainland by strengthening patriotic education and overhauling how the city's leader and other top officials are appointed and removed.
An attempt to introduce national education into Hong Kong schools in 2012 was withdrawn after it sparked protests by students.
""This is how China plans to brainwash the next generation of Hong Kongers,"" said Allan Fong, a 62-year-old retired airport worker who came out to protest on Saturday at a large public park. ""Whether they appoint Carrie Lam or another leader -- they are all the same to us, puppets in the hands of China,"" he said.
As thousands swarmed the park on Saturday, police fired multiple volleys of tear gas in an attempt to disperse the illegal -- but largely peaceful -- gathering.
Later, police chased protesters along major thoroughfares, spraying them with blue-dyed water.
""I feel that as long as these cases keep appearing, Hong Kong people will just get more angry, and it may even push the peaceful protesters to become more violent,"" said Sherry, a 14-year-old protester.
While protesters have dwindled in numbers since the movement was at its peak in June, the momentum shows no sign of waning in this global financial hub.
The unrest is also taking an economic toll. Quarterly figures last week showed Hong Kong had plunged into recession for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis.
""People are finding ways and reflecting what will be next,"" said Eric Lai, the vice-convener of the Civil Human Rights Front, which organized a march attended by more than 1.7 million people in June.
While some protesters have taken a more radical turn, others have formed human chains, created so-called Lennon Walls and sung in shopping malls.
Overall, Mr. Lai said, he doesn't see people giving up.

"Investors Seek Havens as Anxiety Lingers --- While stocks hover near records, signals of a slowdown are also driving safety bets","Investors are snapping up safer assets including gold, dividend-paying stocks and the Japanese yen, as portfolio managers hedge their bets with major U.S. stock indexes near record highs.
The continued strength of the U.S. economy has buoyed equities. On Monday, the Dow industrials posted their third straight gain, rising 249 points, or almost 1%, to 26135. The gains were paced by banks -- among the most economically sensitive sectors -- and trade-facing technology firms such as chip makers Micron Technology and Nvidia.
But some market indicators regarded as reliable forecasters of downturns are sending warning signals. Bond yields have plunged in the second half of 2019, despite Monday's rise in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield to 1.603%. The yields fall when the prices increase.
""The market mood is very uncertain right now,"" said James Bianco, head of Chicago-based advisory firm Bianco Research. ""There are a lot of things happening at once and investors are not sure what to make of them.""
The prices of rich-country government bonds have surged since July, sending yields in Europe to record lows and pushing the global pool of negative-yielding debt above $15 trillion. The world's best-performing major currency is the Japanese yen, which has long been the go-to destination for nervous investors. Gold has risen more than 10% in 2019 and stands near a six-year high. The S&P 500 has also logged a double-digit gain but has been outpaced by gold -- a confluence that has occurred just four other times in the past four decades.
Shares of real-estate firms, consumer-staples companies and utilities are the only S&P 500 sectors to notch significant gains this month. Investors tend to favor those sectors during rocky periods because of their relatively stable earnings and sizable dividend payments.
The shift to safer assets is the latest round in investors' yearlong bout with fears that a global slowdown will end the decadelong U.S. expansion. While the evidence so far favors continued economic growth, more portfolio managers are hedging their bets in case the argument for recession becomes clearer.
Investors this week will parse minutes from the Federal Reserve's last meeting, with many expecting the central bank to continue lowering interest rates to brace the economy from trade tensions. Comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the central bank's annual retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyo., could also swing markets.
Many investors think that trade uncertainty could last for months or years, even after the White House said last week it would delay some of its most recent tariffs on Chinese imports until December. Other concerns center on the impact of Brexit, political friction in such places as Italy, India and Korea, and violent protests in Hong Kong.
The decline in interest rates stands to be good for stocks, at least in the short term. Lower rates make shares look more attractive -- the latest affirmation of the ""There Is No Alternative"" to stocks thesis known as Tina.
Yet many investors are skeptical that lower interest rates around the world will spur a pickup in economic activity. Many also believe that the buildup of negative-yielding debt, particularly in Europe and Japan, and the plunge to near-record lows of U.S. Treasury yields mark ominous signs for the world economy.
""People would have thought these low interest rates would spur growth, but they're not,"" said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income. Mr. Tipp holds long-dated bonds in his portfolio, which he expects to rise in price as rates fall.
More fund managers are bullish on bonds than during any other time since the financial crisis, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey conducted Aug. 2 to Aug. 8 showed. More than a third of those polled believe a recession is likely in the next 12 months, the highest reading in nearly eight years.
Investors' fears help explain why both gold and stocks are up more than 15% in 2019, something that has occurred only two other times in the past 40 years, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
Some investors are choosing to weather trade uncertainty by turning to U.S. stocks, which are perceived to benefit from the relative stability of domestic growth and ultralow interest rates around the world. The S&P 500's dividend yield recently eclipsed the 10-year Treasury yield, and shares of consumer-products firms including Kellogg Co. and General Mills Inc. have been among the beneficiaries.
Other investors believe the signal from the gold rally is stronger.
Aided by low interest rates, markets have repeatedly overcome past bouts of economic worry to continue climbing, including in 2011, when gold rose to a record near $1,900 a troy ounce.
Low bond yields also benefit gold because they make the metal -- which doesn't generate any income for holders -- more attractive to yield-seeking investors.
Fund managers surveyed by Bank of America are also holding more cash than they have on average in the past decade. And hedge funds and other speculative investors have increased bets on continued gains in gold and the yen, figures from Scotiabank and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.
""A lot of people just don't like volatility, so they are looking for ways to find a buffer against the market,"" said Mariann Montagne, a portfolio manager at Gradient Investments, which has been favoring gold recently. ""We don't think we've seen the last of the gyrating trade tweets.""

Business News: LVMH Allays Concerns on China Tensions,"PARIS -- Strong third-quarter results at LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE buoyed shares across the luxury sector Thursday, easing fears that months of protests in Hong Kong and U.S.-China trade tensions would dent global sales of high-end brands.
Paris-based LVMH, the world's biggest luxury company, said its revenue for the quarter was 13.3 billion euros ($14.6 billion), an 11% increase after adjusting for the impact of currency fluctuations and acquisitions. LVMH's shares rose 5.9%, while the news boosted shares of Kering SA by 4.6%, Cie. Financiere Richemont SA by 2.2% and Prada SpA by 1.1%. Burberry Group PLC rose 0.7%.
Investors had worried about the effect on sales of the protests against Beijing's encroachment on the autonomy of Hong Kong, a magnet for well-heeled shoppers from across Asia. Many of the city's high-end boutiques have been forced to close during waves of mass demonstrations since March.
LVMH is so large and has so many brands -- including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi and Dom Perignon -- that disruption in one shopping destination had little impact on its overall results. Louis Vuitton, the luxury industry's biggest brand, with annual sales estimated at more than 12 billion euros, ""enjoyed a remarkable performance in all its businesses and in all regions,"" LVMH said.
The trade dispute between the U.S. and China also seemed to have little impact. Chinese shoppers are the luxury industry's most important clients, accounting for roughly a third of global sales.
""This is a testament to the strength of the LV and Dior brands, as well as a reality check on the current global luxury demand momentum,"" Bernstein analyst Luca Solca wrote.
Hong Kong is particularly important for the Swiss watch industry, in most years ranking as its biggest market. In 2018, Hong Kong accounted for 14% of total Swiss watch exports. This year, the protests have had an impact, cutting exports by 6% through August.
The industry appears to be making up the slack in other markets, particularly mainland China. Swiss watch exports to China are up 14% this year. LVMH, whose main watch brands are TAG Heuer, Hublot and Bulgari, said watch and jewelry sales in the latest quarter rose 5% from a year earlier.

World News: Taiwan Leader Assails China's Hong Kong Policy,"In a speech likely to upset Beijing, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen called on the island's people to draw lessons from the violent protests in Hong Kong and pledged to defend Taiwan's sovereignty.
Speaking on the self-governed island's National Day, Ms. Tsai said the Hong Kong protests illustrated the failure of Beijing's ""one country, two systems"" governance of the Chinese special administrative region. She said Taiwan had to defend itself against Beijing's goal of one day putting the island under a similar system.
""We are witnessing China's rise and expansion, as they challenge free, democratic values,"" Ms. Tsai said. ""Taiwan has become the first line of defense for democratic values.""
Saber-rattling from Taiwan's president is typical on Oct. 10, a day commemorated on both sides of the Taiwan Strait for the 1911 overthrow of China's last imperial dynasty. Ms. Tsai's tone was more urgent this year, as she gears up for a presidential election in January.
The Taiwanese people have watched Beijing's tightening of its grip over Hong Kong and the violent clashes with trepidation, fearing the island may face a similar future.
""Truly what happened in the last few months in Hong Kong has alarmed a lot of people in Taiwan,"" said Yen Chen-shen, a professor at the National Chengchi University's Institute of International Relations in Taiwan. ""If China wants to approach Taiwan about any sort of negotiations, it will not be trusted.""

"World News: Hong Kong Protesters Learn From Past --- In lessons from 2014, organizers stay out of view, amass supplies to deal with police","HONG KONG -- When police broke out the tear gas on Wednesday, the protesters knew what to do.
They started handing out hundreds of bottles of sodium-chloride solution already prepared to pour into the burning eyes of comrades exposed to the fumes.
Other gear sorted into piles near the protest site included hard hats, plastic ties to secure metal barriers, plastic wrap to protect exposed skin and umbrellas and masks to ward off pepper spray.
""One thing we know is they are going to pepper spray us,"" said protester Joyce Lam. Ms. Lam, 27 years old, got her education in confronting police five years ago, she said, during the last major demonstrations to rock Hong Kong.
The protests of the past week have been haunted by the ghosts of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, when thousands of people camped out nightly in central Hong Kong for 79 days to demand the ability to vote for the territory's leader.
Protesters in 2014 didn't get the changes they wanted and some leaders were subsequently jailed in a Beijing-supported campaign against political dissent. But the experience taught would-be organizers more sophisticated tactics -- including the perils of publicity.
This time, fliers calling for demonstrations and strikes on June 12 were anonymous. While some known activist groups such as the Civil Human Rights Front issued general calls for strikes, many protesters said they weren't sure who was providing all the gear, and any organization appeared fragmented.
Most protesters on Wednesday wore masks, partly to shield their faces from government surveillance. Police said 11 were arrested.
Protest participants say they got their information on demonstrations, and how to help, from Facebook posts and chat groups on messaging apps WhatsApp or Telegram that emerged without clear leaders.
As the protest was under way, Telegram suffered a major denial of service attack -- an attempt to crash the app -- originating largely from IP addresses in China, according to Telegram CEO Pavel Durov.
The demonstrations were sparked by a bill that would let China extradite from Hong Kong people suspected of some crimes, a move critics fear could be abused by Beijing for political aims. On Sunday, June 9, organizers said an estimated million people marched against the proposed law. Police put the number at 240,000.
Hong Kong lawmakers were scheduled to consider the bill on Wednesday -- but have now postponed this week's debate. Activists have called for another mass demonstration this weekend.
The Umbrella Movement schooled thousands of Hong Kongers in the art of occupation and police confrontation, giving them hands-on experience in skills such as stockpiling food for sit-ins to administering first aid.
Hong Kong Indigenous, a local political group, posted on its Facebook page a ""Confrontation Handbook,"" with chapters on what to wear, when to charge and when to retreat, and how to divide responsibilities in the protest ranks.
""Write the phone number of your lawyer on your body using oil-based marker,"" advises the handbook in a chapter on what to do if arrested.
A host of internet forums and messaging app groups, some with tens of thousands of followers, circulated calls for mass demonstrations on Wednesday.
As people gathered on Wednesday,demonstrators wound through the crowd handing out face masks, helmets, goggles and water, as well as bags of McDonald's hamburgers and cheeseburgers, said Arthur Suen, a fitness coach whose boss gave him the day off to join the demonstration.
Two protesters climbed atop a tram stop to coordinate, directing supplies to different places. Plastic zip ties were passed toward the front lines of the protest area to bind barricades, and medical supplies were sent to the side, where one of many makeshift first-aid stations was established.
Police managed to clear part of the protest area by evening. By midnight most of thedemonstrators had started collecting their gear. One group piled an assortment of head coverings, including hard hats and bicycle helmets, into an empty phone booth.
""Umbrellas go here,"" one protester shouted to another, pointing to a metal railing near the phone booth. Goggles were deposited in a bag nearby. Two other black-shirted demonstrators wound plastic wrap around the top of the booth, sealing it off for the next protest.

Hong Kong May Topple Communism,"As Hong Kong entered the 16th straight week of unrest, protesters adopted origami cranes as symbols of resistance, sang their new anthem, burned the Chinese national flag, erected barricades, threw petrol bombs and beat opponents unconscious. The protest movement in the semiautonomous region now has taken on characteristics of an insurgency as people across Hong Kong society vigorously challenge local authorities.
The 79-day ""Umbrella"" protest of 2014, as large as it was, had little lasting effect on Beijing, which has ruled Hong Kong as a ""special administrative region"" since 1997. This year's protests are different. ""China's disintegration is now under way,"" Arthur Waldron, a China historian at the University of Pennsylvania, told me last month.
In Chinese history, regimes often unravel from the outside in. ""Disintegration,"" Mr. Waldron told me, ""begins at the limits of empire, only to grow, steadily undermining adjacent territory, until the seats of central power are imperiled."" That's what happened in the 10th century to the mighty Tang dynasty, which, as Mr. Waldron puts it, was ""mortally wounded by military disorders remote to the capital.""
Similarly, in the mid-19th century, the Qing dynasty was fatally weakened by the 14-year-long Taiping Rebellion. Starting in southern China not far from Hong Kong, the revolt -- actually an attempted revolution -- claimed an estimated 20 million lives and displaced tens of millions more. The Manchu Qing rulers held onto power for nearly a half-century longer but never recovered from perhaps the most destructive civil war in history.
Almost every analyst today assumes that one way or another, Beijing will prevail in the current crisis. China's Communist Party maintains the world's largest standing army, with more than two million personnel. Some 7,000 are already stationed in Hong Kong. The hard-core protesters dressed in black -- a ""guerrilla force,"" according to American correspondent Michael Yon -- number only in the thousands.
Yet despite appearances, Beijing is at a disadvantage. The mass of Hong Kong residents firmly oppose Beijing's encroachments. The protests, initially over a bill that would have allowed extradition to the mainland, have widened in scope. Now the target is China itself and its effort to eliminate the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement that had promised Hong Kong a ""high degree of autonomy.""
China's efforts to take over Hong Kong have resulted in a shift in self-identification, especially among younger adults. A recent Hong Kong University survey shows that the share of 18- to 29-year-olds who self-identify as Hong Konger rather than Chinese or mixed has surged to about 75% from 40% a decade ago. Almost nobody in this group believes he is Chinese only. A plurality of residents of all ages now see themselves as Hong Konger only.
Changes in self-identification have fueled a still-small independence movement, which did not exist a decade ago. Whether or not Hong Kongers want to separate fully from China, Beijing has to be concerned by protesters there repeating the line from ""The Hunger Games"": ""If we burn, you burn with us!""
As protesters clash with police, analysts worry about another Tiananmen, the June 1989 slaughter in Beijing. Soldiers in tanks and armored personnel carriers moved to the center of the capital, killing at will.
I think Chinese leaders know that such a response is not possible this time. Hong Kong's dense urban landscape -- tall buildings and narrow roads and alleys -- reduces the advantages of armor and favors defenders, who can occupy the high ground from apartment buildings. Many protesters say they're willing to fight to the end; eight have committed suicide to dramatize their cause.
The militant demonstrators not only are determined but are becoming an effective fighting force. Mr. Yon, who has observed them from the beginning, told me the emerging contingent of youthful fighters is ""breathing, growing, evolving so fast that I am having difficulty tracking its evolution."" Chinese ruler Xi Jinping surely does not want his first war to take years, kill thousands of Chinese, and end in a loss.
The authorities don't have the ability to clear the streets, and the longer the demonstrations continue, the higher the risk they spread to the mainland. Mainlanders have already crossed the border into Hong Kong to stand with the protesters there -- like one earnest young man from Guangdong province who spoke with me earlier this month in front of the Mong Kok police station. He and perhaps 1,000 Hong Kong men and women in surgical masks had squared off with riot police in Darth Vader-type helmets and visors.
The majority of mainlanders have little sympathy for Hong Kongers, but they do have grievances of their own, especially as economic growth slows and Mr. Xi enforces tighter social controls. Beijing has to be worried that ordinary Chinese will be inspired by the boldness of those in Hong Kong, who have inflicted severe political damage on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and forced her to announce concessions.
Protesters know Beijing is afraid of contagion and have targeted mainland tourists with messages delivered by Apple's AirDrop app, among other means. They congregate around venues frequented by mainland tourists to press their case.
The protesters have significantly changed the political narrative in Taiwan, which Beijing also considers its rightful possession. Until the Hong Kong protests began, it looked as if a pro-Beijing figure would be elected Taiwan's president this coming January. Now that's unlikely. The governing Democratic Progressive Party, sometimes described as ""pro-independence,"" has shored up support and is expected to retain power.
There will be little for the Chinese Communist Party to celebrate Oct. 1, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic. Its imperial project is stalling and beginning to disintegrate along the periphery.
But refugees from China's totalitarian rule have reason to be optimistic. A friend of mine fled Mao's army as it approached Beijing seventy years ago, eventually ending up in New Jersey. She vowed never to return to China as long as the Communist Party ruled and had given up hope of ever going back. Last week, she told my wife she now knows she will soon return. She promises to take us to her favorite restaurant in the capital for a jiaozi dinner.

Stocks Sink as Trade-Talk Outlook Darkens,"Stocks fell as a wave of selling that analysts attributed to mounting doubts about a trade deal pulled lower shares of everything from banks to technology companies.
Worries about the path of U.S.-China trade negotiations and the global economy have kept stocks and bond yields under pressure.
Goldman Sachs analysts said the outlook for trade talks had ""collapsed,"" and they believe Washington and Beijing won't reach a pact before the 2020 elections.
Growing uncertainty has contributed to the markets' volatility in recent weeks. At midafternoon, selling pressure unexpectedly picked up, dragging the Dow Jones Industrial Average down as many as 462 points before it pared losses. Analysts said there were no obvious catalysts for the move.
The Dow industrials ended down 389.73 points, or 1.5%, at 25897.71. The S&P 500 declined 35.56 points, or 1.2%, to 2883.09, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 95.73 points, or 1.2%, to 7863.41.
Few believe the U.S. is headed toward a downturn just yet. But many worry that the gloomy outlook reflected in bond markets, where yields across the globe have dropped, could soon be reflected in stocks, too.
""If [yields] keep edging down, the equity market is clearly wrong because the bond market will be telling you we have one mother of a recession coming,"" said Neil Dwane, global strategist at Allianz Global Investors.
Bank stocks took a hit as U.S. Treasury yields retreated again, with Citigroup, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley each losing more than 2%. Declining bond yields tend to weigh on banks by cutting into their lending profits.
Semiconductor firms also lost ground, with Nvidia down $2.73, or 1.8%, to $151.45, and Advanced Micro Devices losing $1.76, or 5.2%, to $32.43. Much of the group has pulled back in recent weeks as investors have grown more pessimistic about the prospects of a U.S.-China trade agreement.
Other proxies for investors' trade optimism also slipped, with Caterpillar down $2.66, or 2.2%, to $116.72, and farm- machinery maker Deere down $7.79, or 5%, to $147.05.
Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.3%, weighed down by declines among lenders and travel and leisure stocks.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.4% after protests at the city's airport prompted authorities to cancel more than 100 flights. Chinese authorities said the violent weekend demonstrations marked the emergence of ""the first signs of terrorism"" in the semiautonomous city -- and vowed a merciless crackdown.
""Hong Kong is clearly an important bellwether for just how far China is willing to exert its influence,"" said Matthew Cairns, a senior rates strategist at Rabobank.
In early trading Tuesday, the Hang Seng was down a further 1.4% and the Shanghai Composite was down 0.6% after closing higher on Monday.
At midday Tuesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Stock Average was down 1.2%, South Korea's Kospi was down 0.6% and Australia's S&P ASX 200 was down 0.3%. The dollar was up against the yen to 105.21 yen in Asian trading Tuesday.

"World News: Hong Kong Protesters Target Stores, Subway","HONG KONG -- Antigovernment protesters built roadblocks, smashed storefronts and clashed with police in multiple locations around the city on Sunday, as demonstrators sought to keep pressure on Hong Kong's government ahead of a major policy speech by the city's leader and the reconvening of the legislature.
Around 5:30 p.m., a protester allegedly used a ""sharp-edged object"" to slash an officer's neck at a subway station, police said. The officer, who was conscious, was taken to a hospital, and police arrested two people at the scene.
Earlier, demonstrators hurled objects onto the track at another station, and police said they had to fire tear gas. Television videos showed police detaining people inside a shopping center and a fire burning near a Chinese bank's ATMs.
Protesters had planned to demonstrate in 18 districts Sunday in an event they called ""Blossoms Everywhere"" on social media, suggesting the antigovernment movement has momentum even after this 19th weekend of unrest. Though it appeared to draw fewer protesters than the mass rallies earlier in the year, demonstrators said that reflected new strategies such as holding small protests simultaneously instead of one big rally.
The continued protests pose a challenge for Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, who on Wednesday is to give her annual policy address, in which she is expected to lay out the government's goals. Mrs. Lam could offer measures to address social concerns such as high property prices and a high cost of living. Protesters will also be watching to see if the controversial extradition bill that sparked the protests is officially withdrawn -- as the government has pledged -- when the legislature reconvenes Wednesday.
In what could be a veiled threat to Hong Kong's protesters, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned during a visit to Nepal on Sunday that anyone attempting to split China would be crushed, according to China's state-run Xinhua News Agency.
The protests have battered Hong Kong's economy and threatened its position as a business hub, while complicating President Trump's negotiations with China over a trade deal. After a meeting with China's vice premier at the White House on Friday, Mr. Trump said the protests had ""toned down a lot"" and that ""great progress has been made by China in Hong Kong.""
A march on Saturday through a busy shopping district attracted thousands of protesters. Some said they hoped the demonstration would show Mr. Trump the antigovernment movement still has broad support. While many of those marchers were peaceful, some smashed windows at Chinese banks, government buildings and stores considered to be pro-Beijing.
The slashing of the police officer could renew a debate among protesters over whether the movement is becoming too violent. A masked male protester in a shopping center in the Tai Koo district said many protesters were arrested the previous week, making some protesters rethink violence as a strategy. ""We are trying to be more peaceful than last week,"" he said, noting that protesters are targeting specific stores and trying to reduce unnecessary vandalism.

World News: Trade-Fight Impact Worries Central Banks --- Bankers have less room to cut rates to spur growth at a time of rising uncertainties,"JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. -- The world's central bankers are increasingly worried that President Trump's tactics to reorder global trade are destabilizing economies in ways that they can't easily fix.
Gloom filled the atmosphere in the Jackson Lake Lodge, where central bankers and academic economists from around the world gather every August, because with borrowing costs already low, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have less room to cut rates to spur growth.
""We are experiencing a series of major political shocks,"" said Reserve Bank of Australia Gov. Philip Lowe at the concluding panel Saturday. ""And those political shocks are turning into economic shocks.""
Rising uncertainty over trade policy adds to a growing list of geopolitical tensions, including protests in Hong Kong, Britain's threat to crash out of the European Union on Oct. 31, a political crisis in Italy that could roil the euro, conflicts between Japan and South Korea, and India's military lockdown in the Kashmir region bordering Pakistan.
But central bankers made clear they see President Trump's mercurial trade policy as the biggest of these threats.
""I've never seen the world so synchronized and so globally spooked about something that initially hadn't even happened,"" said Adrian Orr, the head of New Zealand's central bank, in an interview Friday. ""You get nervous that you're in this boiled frog situation where things slowly come to the boil, and then you discover that [growth] is permanently lower.""
Fed officials have been very reluctant to criticize Mr. Trump's trade policies, but some were outspoken. Former Fed vice chairman Stanley Fischer said, ""The problem is not in the [international monetary system]. It is in the president of the United States,"" he said. ""It's not a service to anybody at least privately to not focus on what the key problems are.""
Officials said they hoped world leaders at the G-7 summit in Biarritz, France, would heed recent ominous signals of rising recession risks.
Central bankers said they feared political leaders were inflicting avoidable pain on the economy with little to show for it. ""To some extent, it's not necessary,"" said Oystein Olsen, Norway's central bank governor.
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, in an interview Thursday, warned that central banks' tools aren't well-suited to deal with the political sources of economic weakness. ""Monetary policy probably wasn't creating the slowdown, and it probably can't, by itself, arrest this slowdown if it's going to intensify,"" he said.
The Fed lowered its benchmark rate last month to a range between 2% and 2.25%. The quarter-percentage-point cut was its first in more than a decade. One concern is that after decades of monetary stimulus, lower rates may buoy asset prices but won't otherwise remove the uncertainty holding back investment.
Businesses ""are asking questions about whether they should even be investing,"" said Lesetja Kganyago, governor of the South African Reserve Bank. ""So you could scream at the central banks all you like, but the truth of the matter is with ultralow interest rates, corporates are still not investing.""
While employment growth has held steady, policy makers said they feared it was only a matter of time before an investment chill would lead to hiring cutbacks. ""When you're uncertain, what do you do? You sit on your hands,"" said Australia's Mr. Lowe. ""It wouldn't take too much for businesses to decide not to invest and not to hire people.""
On the sidelines of the event, many officials were left speechless by Mr. Trump's escalating rhetorical attack on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whom the president picked to serve a four-year term beginning last year. Unhappy that Mr. Powell didn't signal aggressive stimulus on Friday, Mr. Trump suggested on Twitter that the Fed chief was an enemy of the state.
""There is this rise of populism, and central banks are like the lightning rod,"" said Mr. Kganyago, whose bank is under growing pressure from some South African political leaders to play a bigger role in the economy. ""Attacks on the Fed should not be seen in isolation."" He said the Fed's response has been ""commendable.""
After being pressed to serve as first responders to economic emergencies since the 2008 financial crisis, central bankers worry they now face greater risks -- one from disappointing the public, fueling more threats to their independence, and another from over-relying on stimulus that might do more to lift asset prices, possibly leading to bubbles, than to generate stronger underlying growth.

LVMH Drives Luxury to High End of Market,"PARIS -- Selling handbags, cognac and designer fashion, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE has become one of the most valuable companies in Europe.
Its shares are worth more than Europe's biggest auto maker, Volkswagen AG, and biggest bank, HSBC Holdings PLC. This week, LVMH's market capitalization topped 200 billion euros ($221 billion) for the first time, making it almost as valuable as Europe's biggest oil producer, Royal Dutch Shell PLC.
LVMH isn't the only stock-market star in the luxury business: The share prices of two of LVMH's smaller rivals, Kering SA and Hermes International SA, have soared over the past two years.
The shift in stock-market fortunes is a sign of how the luxury business is eclipsing sectors that were once at the core of the European economy. Banks are struggling to adapt to new post-financial-crisis regulations. Auto makers face declining car sales. Big oil companies are subject to the whims of turbulent oil and natural-gas markets.
But LVMH, Kering and Hermes are enjoying a strong tailwind: steady growth in the number of customers around the world who want to own a piece of European heritage. The growth has been strongest among the Chinese, whose fast-rising incomes have made them the luxury industry's most important customers. But the three companies are selling strongly to Americans and Europeans as well.
LVMH, which owns 75 brands, has created a mass market for luxury by selling goods with a range of prices that can attract consumers who vary in age and income. Louis Vuitton, which by some estimates accounts for one-quarter of LVMH's sales and half of its operating profit, sells leather goods starting at a few hundred dollars in over 450 stores world-wide. A bottle of Hennessy Cognac sells for as little as $25. Sephora cosmetics boutiques are in malls across the U.S.
Now the conglomerate aims to add engagement rings in blue boxes to its offering. This month it decided to use some of the cash it accumulated during the luxury boom to make a bid for Tiffany & Co., the American jeweler. At $14.5 billion, Tiffany would be the biggest acquisition yet by Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire who is the chief executive and controlling shareholder of LVMH.
Tiffany has said it is reviewing the offer and that no discussions have taken place.
""As long as global market conditions support a larger and larger audience of consumers who are interested in and capable of buying luxury goods, LVMH is in a great position,"" said Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein & Co.
Kering has been powered by Gucci, one of the hottest brands in fashion over the past three years. Hermes relies on its lines of handbags, which can retail for more than $10,000 each. LVMH, Kering and Hermes occupy three of the top seven spots by market cap on the CAC-40, France's main stock index, ahead of BNP Paribas, France's largest bank, and AXA SA, the country's largest insurer.
The industry's good fortunes have been far from evenly distributed. Outside those three, high-end fashion companies such as Prada SpA and Burberry Group PLC have struggled to rejuvenate their brands. The fashion conglomerates appear to have gained an advantage compared with single-brand houses because their labels can share know-how and pool costs in areas such as marketing, logistics and real estate.
LVMH has been by far the luxury industry's best performer this year, with its shares up nearly 60%. Revenue rose 16% in the first nine months of the year, as LVMH brushed aside threats from protests in Hong Kong and trade tensions between Beijing and Washington. The share-price increase has put LVMH's market cap on par with Coca-Cola Co. and Boeing Co.

"EXCHANGE --- Friday's Markets: Dow Average Hits Another Milestone --- Blue-chip index jumps above 28000 in final minutes, extending long bull run","The Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed 28000 for the first time Friday, notching a new high as fading recession fears extended the decadelong bull-market rally.
A furious rise in the final minutes of the trading session thrust the Dow above its latest milestone, re-energizing a stock market that appeared listless in recent days.
Investors drove the Dow up 222.93 points, or 0.8%, to 28004.89 -- its 11th record close of 2019 -- as they cheered trade developments and a rosier economic outlook. The blue-chip gauge has logged four straight weeks of gains.
The S&P 500 and technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite also closed at records, extending their weekly winning streaks to six and seven, respectively.
This week's optimism was spurred, in part, by White House economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow who indicated progress toward a potential trade deal with China and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell who noted strength in the economy. A better-than-feared corporate earnings season has also helped fend off fears of a downturn that had weighed on markets in recent months.
Meanwhile, fresh data Friday showed U.S. retail sales rebounded in October, rising 0.3% after a drop the previous month. Those figures bolstered confidence in the U.S. consumer, a key engine of domestic growth, and followed a strong earnings report from Walmart. The retail giant on Thursday reported another increase in sales, marking a five-year streak of quarterly sales gains.
Those developments reignited investor enthusiasm about the final stretch of 2019, particularly in light of the Federal Reserve's three interest-rate cuts this year. Many investors had previously been wary of a redo of 2018, when an autumn selloff erased a rally that had been months in the making.
Now, many predict the recent rally to continue.
""Ever so slowly . . . you get increasing confirmation that this slowdown has stabilized,"" said Joseph Amato, chief investment officer at Neuberger Berman. ""All these things have come together to build a little bit more confidence in risk assets.""
The Dow's climb above 28000 marked its first thousand-point milestone since July. Much of those gains were powered by Apple, whose shares have advanced 32% since mid-July, and Microsoft. Other large contributors: Home Depot, United Technologies and JPMorgan Chase, which have combined to add 385 points to the index since it crossed 27000.
In Friday's session, some of the biggest winners were shares of health-care companies including UnitedHealth Group and Pfizer after the Trump administration released a far-reaching plan on pricing transparency.
The S&P 500 finished the week 0.9% higher. Its six consecutive weeks of gains are the longest such stretch in two years. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.8% this week.
Strong retail earnings like those from Walmart have spurred optimism that a strong holiday season could be ahead.
Shares of J.C. Penney rose 6.4% Friday after the retailer boosted its financial outlook for the year and reported better-than-expected third-quarter results.
Investors have also been encouraged by a rebound in government-bond yields, particularly in the U.S. The growing positive gap between 10-year yields and two-year yields has helped ease fears about a potential recession.
""Much of this rally over the past 30 days is the reassessment of the recession risk that was increasingly priced into the market,"" said Bob Browne, chief investment officer of Northern Trust Corp. ""We would expect this momentum to continue.""
The string of records for stocks comes as broader markets have been in a lull. In one sign of how sleepy trading has been, the Dow finished unchanged earlier this week for only the third time since 2000.
The S&P 500, meanwhile, hadn't moved up or down more than 0.5% for nine consecutive trading days through Thursday, the longest streak since October 2018, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
This is partially driven by mixed signals of progress between the U.S. and China that have left investors in a lurch, analysts said.
""I think the uncertainty is still elevated,"" said Justin Onuekwusi, head of retail multiasset funds at Legal & General Investment Management. ""Just because you see an improvement doesn't mean it's gone away,"" he said.
Though stock investors appeared elated, caution was evident in traditionally safer investments this week, as investors also scooped up haven assets like Treasurys and gold. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.833%, its biggest one-week yield decline in a month. Gold prices edged higher.
Some analysts said risks have receded, rather than positive news emerging lately to help drive stocks higher.
For example, though retail sales didn't disappoint, the data stood in contrast to U.S. factory production, which fell in October. Mr. Powell told lawmakers Thursday that the U.S.-China trade conflict has weighed on domestic manufacturing activity.
Elsewhere, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was flat Friday but ended the week down 4.8%, its worst week since early August, after antigovernment protests in the Chinese territory turned more violent with some of the worst clashes in six months of unrest. The Shanghai Composite Index ended the week down 2.5%.

U.S. News: Businesses Question U.S.-China Next Steps,"WASHINGTON -- American companies cheered when the U.S. and China called a cease-fire in their trade war this month, but as both sides work toward drafting an initial deal some worry that a more meaningful, long-term pact may never be reached.
Negotiators from both sides are working toward a ""phase one"" agreement that would halt additional U.S. tariffs in exchange for big Chinese purchases of American farm goods, new rules on currency manipulation and efforts by China to finish opening its financial sector to foreign firms.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke by phone Friday with China's Vice Premier Liu He, and afterward put out a statement saying they ""made headway on specific issues and the two sides are close to finalizing some sections of the agreement,"" helping lift financial markets.
Beyond the phase one agreement, however, U.S. business groups are concerned other issues aimed at leveling the playing field for U.S. businesses will be pushed down the road and languish.
U.S. executives regularly complain that they are pressured to share or give away crucial technology in exchange for access to China's market and face restrictions on how they can use data that hurt their ability to compete there.
""There is a risk that once something is announced on phase one, it is very unclear what will happen beyond that and whether there would just be continuing talks and no results,"" said Christine Bliss, president of the Coalition of Services Industries, an umbrella group that includes everything from financial firms to express delivery.
Those concerns are echoed by others that believe U.S. companies increasingly face high hurdles in the China market.
The preliminary phase one agreement ""does not address many of the fundamental issues that have led to heightened tensions"" between the U.S. and China, said Libby Cantrill, head of public policy at bond manager Pacific Investment Management Co.
""It would not be surprising if the romance is short-lived and Trump returns to not only more adversarial rhetoric but also more combative actions,"" Ms. Cantrill said.
The White House is hoping to have a deal ready by mid-November when it could potentially be signed by President Trump and China's President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile.
Phase one might include some measures to protect intellectual property, along with confirmation that China will follow through with earlier plans to open its financial services, officials and business groups say.
Yet the thorniest issues faced by American financial firms and other companies -- the forced transfer of technology, limits on the movement of data and subsidies enjoyed by Chinese competitors -- aren't set to be addressed in the first step, these people say.
What is more, continuing economic and security disagreements, including over Beijing's handling of protests in Hong Kong, are complicating the ability of the two countries to make concessions.
Since May, when Mr. Trump halted negotiations as both sides were believed to be near a deal, Western business groups note half a dozen steps Beijing has taken to limit foreign participation in information technology, telecommunications and the free flow of data in the country.
Those steps could make it difficult for financial firms, for example, to thrive in China even if they are allowed to establish fully owned subsidiaries there.
Chinese officials say a new foreign investment law coming into effect next year addresses Washington's demands on opening up to foreign companies.

"Battles Between Protesters, Police Intensify in Hong Kong","HONG KONG -- Large fires burned at a university here early Monday as police threatened lethal force and advanced on a group of increasingly militant pro-democracy activists armed with makeshift weapons who have occupied the campus for days.
Protesters inside the campus of Hong Kong Polytechnic University hurled Molotov cocktails as police tried to storm the grounds. The entryway and areas around the university's perimeter were quickly engulfed in flames. One protester shown on live video was seen firing an arrow at the officers.
In some of the fiercest clashes since protests began in the Chinese-ruled city five months ago, police on Sunday used water-cannon blasts, tear gas and beanbag rounds against students who started a massive fire on a bridge, shot a police officer in the leg with an arrow and set fire to an armored car.
As the fighting continued, police said they would fire their guns if attacked by people police Superintendent Louis Lau described as ""coldblooded rioters.""
""We will have no other choice but to use the minimal force necessary to address the situation, including real bullets,"" he said.
In a video recording addressing protesters, university President Jin-Guang Teng said the university had negotiated a temporary cease-fire to allow protesters to leave peacefully. Hundreds still remained on campus at noon Monday, according to one student inside. Some managed to flee.
The confrontation capped a week of violence that has marked a significant shift in the struggle, with the core of college- and high school-aged activists driving the unrest now stockpiling makeshift weapons and adopting more aggressive tactics in an effort to maintain the movement's momentum.
Thirty-eight injured people -- ranging in age from 16 to 84 -- were being treated at local hospitals following the clashes at Polytechnic, according to the Hospital Authority. Five people were reported to be in serious condition.
""We don't want to fight a war, but we have no choice,"" said an activist manning the barricades at the university over the weekend, a 16-year-old high-school student wearing a black balaclava and protective goggles who gave his name as Quentin. ""We want freedom, human rights.""
Police have responded with escalating force, shooting three protesters since the protests began. They have said they were acting in self-defense.
In a highly symbolic act on Saturday, unarmed Chinese soldiers stationed in Hong Kong departed their barracks to clear road debris left by protesters, sparking fears of intervention.
Hong Kong's pro-China leader Carrie Lam had remained out of sight in recent days before emerging Monday, paying a hospital visit to the officer who had been shot by an arrow.
Also Monday, the Hong Kong High Court ruled a law banning people from wearing masks is unconstitutional, a setback for city authorities who imposed the measure under emergency powers to curb the wave of protests.
For months, the prospect that China could deploy its army to quash the unrest has hung over the city. Last week, China's leader, Xi Jinping, personally exhorted Hong Kong authorities to restore order, fueling speculation of a crackdown.
The increasing violence also stands to deepen rifts within Hong Kong society about protest tactics.
Several days spent at Polytechnic and Chinese University of Hong Kong offered stark evidence of the transformation reshaping the dynamics of the protest movement.
Instead of chanting slogans, protesters massed weapons. Instead of creating wall art, they built fortifications.
Protesters described their use of Molotov cocktails and other weapons as self-defense against aggressive police tactics. They complained their movement has run out of peaceful options such as marches, permits for which the government routinely denies.
Many said they were pressing forward even though they believe they aren't likely to achieve their current demands of universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into police violence.
Police said they have used a minimum of force during months of unrest. Meanwhile, videos of arrests that end in beatings are rife on social media.
Shortly after 11 p.m. on Sunday, police began pushing toward barricades built by protesters near the entrance to a tunnel that links Hong Kong island to Kowloon, where the Polytechnic University is located. The tunnel has been closed for days, after student protesters blockaded it and set its tollbooths on fire. Debris still litters the roadway.
""We're surrounded now,"" said a Polytechnic student who gave his name as Tam. He said he had been inside the fortified campus since last Monday.
Hundreds of protesters sheltered behind a tangle of desks, chairs and tables, squaring off with police in the darkness. Several held Molotov cocktails, while another group carried a giant slingshot.
Last week, activists stockpiled firebombs at the university and constructed roadblocks from debris and masonry to prevent police vehicles from approaching. They posted lookouts and required visitors to produce identification to a ""border guard"" dressed in black and wearing body armor.
Hundreds of protesters converged at Polytechnic in recent days, the last holdout of a group of universities occupied last week.
The first violence of the week erupted overnight Tuesday at the Chinese University.
Students there engaged police for hours in a fiery battle at a narrow bridge, and real-time images of the fight attracted hundreds of young demonstrators to the scene.
One was a 17-year-old high school junior who arrived clad in his school uniform. He had been at a chemistry-tutoring session when he saw images of the fights and raced there with a younger friend. Both had recently completed first-aid classes to act as medics.
""We came to fight for our freedom,"" he said.
The protests, initially triggered by a now-withdrawn extradition bill, have turned into an antigovernment movement focused on alleged police brutality and China's increasing encroachment.
The stakes are high for Hong Kong, a former British colony that was returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. As part of the handover agreement, Hong Kong was supposed to remain a semiautonomous city under the ""one country, two systems"" regime until 2047.
A crackdown by Beijing could spell the end of Hong Kong's autonomy and dilute its role as a global financial hub.
The saga represents a black eye for China, too, which is embroiled in a bitter trade war with the U.S. and facing increasing scrutiny around the world for its detention program targeting ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang.
The Civil Human Rights Front, an umbrella group that organized some of the biggest marches and rallies over the summer, called for the Hong Kong government and police to de-escalate the situation.
""With the tense atmosphere and escalation of the use of force by police, we worry that the protesters, most of whom are our young and future generation, will face arrest with bloodshed,"" the group said.

Shares Rise After Mixed Earnings Bag,"Stocks inched higher, extending a streak of listless trading for markets.
Major indexes opened little changed and drifted in a narrow range throughout the trading session.
Many of the biggest moves of the day stemmed from companies that had recently reported quarterly earnings.
S&P 500 companies have largely managed to beat analysts' estimates so far-- although investors note that expectations were low for the quarter, because of factors including a slowing global economy and a still unresolved U.S.-China trade fight.
Even if the two countries manage this year to strike a firmer deal to roll tariffs back, there will still be ""a meaningful slowdown going into the first half of next year,"" said Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS.
The S&P 500 rose 8.53 points, or 0.3%, to 3004.52. The Nasdaq Composite gained 15.50 points, or 0.2%, to 8119.79, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 45.85 points, or 0.2%, to 26833.95.
Semiconductor stocks trailed behind major indexes, with Texas Instruments dropping $9.62, or 7.5%, to $118.95 after giving a downbeat outlook for the fourth quarter.
Health-care stocks were mixed. Eli Lilly fell $2.44, or 2.2%, to $107.40 after posting revenue that missed analysts' expectations, but medical-device maker Boston Scientific climbed $1.91, or 5%, to $40.09 after it raised its revenue growth target. Alexion Pharmaceuticals rose $7.35, or 7.4%, to $106.63 after reporting better-than-expected earnings and raising its guidance for the full year.
Among industrials, Boeing shares added $3.50, or 1%, to $340.50 after the aerospace company said profit more than halved in the latest quarter but indicated it still expects its 737 MAX to return to service by year-end.
Caterpillar rose $1.65, or 1.2%, to $135.34 despite reporting drops in earnings and revenue and lowering its profit forecast for the year. The firm's executives said on an earnings call that they expect to continue share buybacks in the second half.
Such repurchases often help support stock prices and boost per-share earnings.
The Stoxx Europe 600 ticked up 0.1% after British lawmakers endorsed the terms of a Brexit agreement but rejected the government's proposed timetable.
The pound, which had fallen sharply after Tuesday's votes, edged up 0.3% against the dollar.
Parliament's rejection of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's legislative schedule for Brexit reduced the likelihood of a departure by Oct. 31, said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
Mr. Johnson said that he would try to trigger an election if lawmakers move too slowly in considering his deal.
""There are a lot of moving parts,"" which makes it hard for investors to position for what happens next, he said. ""We are now in extension territory and we've been in that territory for a while.""
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell 0.8%, posting its biggest one-day decline since the start of the month, following reports that China is preparing to replace the city's leader, Carrie Lam. Early Thursday, the index was up 0.5%. Worries about months of protests in the city and the resulting economic fallout have made the Hang Seng one of the worst-performing indexes in the region this year.
At midday Thursday in Tokyo, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was up 0.4%. the Shanghai Composite was down 0.2%, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was up 0.3% and South Korea's Kospi was down 0.2%.

How Five Money Managers See the Market,"U.S. stocks have been increasingly volatile, with the S&P 500 rising or falling more than 1% almost every day in the past few weeks. Treasurys have rallied, with the 10-year yielding about 1.70%.
These assets aren't alone.
Nearly every market has seesawed this month after a trade dispute between the U.S. and China kick-started a downturn in stocks. On Monday, the S&P 500 lost 1.2%. Then it reversed Tuesday and staged a 1.5% rally. On Wednesday, the market declined again with the S&P 500 off 2.9%.
Some investors see an opportunity in the action. Here is how some large money managers are playing the market:
Jos Shaver manages a $1.3 billion portfolio of stocks for his New York hedge fund, Electron Capital Partners LLC.
Mr. Shaver said the difference between now and other recent bouts of volatility is the decline in bond rates. He said that his concern is that with this type of volatility, more investors start worrying about the possibility of a recession.
""As a result of low rates, I think we're going to be in a much more volatile environment,"" he said. ""We're on this knife edge.""
Mr. Shaver invests in utility and infrastructure stocks, typically viewed as a haven, so he hasn't had to change his strategy. However, lower rates have pushed some larger investors to evaluate purchasing an entire company in his sector, which can create a potential quick return.
""The stocks we're long are the same ones that they're taking private,"" he said. ""So we make a big premium.""
Mr. Shaver said his fund owned shares of El Paso Electric Co., which an infrastructure fund of J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. agreed to acquire in June. The deal was expected to pay shareholders a 17% premium.
That said, he is concerned that too many other investors have plowed into certain stocks within the sector.
""People are paying up unbelievable amounts of money,"" he said. ""They're crowding in.""
Marc Lasry is one of the best known hedge-fund managers in the country. His Avenue Capital Group runs more than $10 billion, and Mr. Lasry is an owner of the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team.
Mr. Lasry focuses on debt investing. He said his strategy is less affected by the heightened volatility and that he has found better deals in Europe and Asia in recent years.
""If you want to generate an excess of 10% [returns], you have to take a lot more risk. You're going to go into different asset classes, different jurisdictions, different countries,"" he said.
""There are a number of situations you can invest in where you can buy the bonds at $80 to generate 10% plus [returns],"" he said. In Asia, similar bonds go for ""$50 or $60.""
On geopolitical issues, he focuses on any potential trade war and on the Twitter account of President Trump.
""You have to deal with a president who is constantly making tweets that have effects on the market,"" he said. ""There's a perception that everything is fine, and then that perception is shattered when the president announces he's going to change the tariffs.""
Greg Staples, head of fixed income for the Americas at DWS Group, has positioned the bond portfolios he runs more defensively.
In some portfolios, Mr. Staples has bought more A-rated debt -- which tends to be safer -- and sold BBB-rated bonds -- which are more risky or likely to default, according to ratings firms. In high-yield debt, his team has purchased more double-B and single-B bonds and moved away from lower-rated triple-C debt.
In June, he had expected thinner-than-usual trading in the summer and limited monetary easing by the Federal Reserve to add to market swings.
""We've been moving up in quality over the last month or so in the anticipation that things could be a bit bumpy,"" said Mr. Staples, who oversees a group managing roughly $140 billion across U.S. active fixed-income and cash strategies.
On a more geopolitical basis, he is staying attuned to the protests in Hong Kong while also monitoring bonds of energy and natural-resources companies that could be affected by tariffs.
Despite the volatility, Mr. Staples said the swings aren't as pronounced as those that occurred at the end of 2018.
Hugo Rogers, who oversees $6 billion as head of investments at private bank Deltec International Group, said he believes markets will remain volatile into the second half of the year amid concern over slowing global growth and trade issues.
""The global economy is vulnerable, and now you're starting to see catalysts emerge to expose that vulnerability,"" he said.
He has recently bet on a decline in the shares of Apple Inc., a company he said could be caught in the trade conflict between China and the U.S., which is ""morphing into a new, dangerous phase,"" he said.
Mr. Rogers began gearing up for volatility earlier in the year when he reduced his fund's position in stocks and beefed up holdings of gold and Treasurys, two assets that are popular destinations for nervous investors. Year-to-date gains in gold have recently overtaken those of the S&P 500, as the stock market's recent swings boost the haven metal's appeal.
Katina Stefanova manages about $200 million at her New York hedge fund, Marto Capital. Ms. Stefanova said she had expected a selloff in stocks and other riskier assets this year.
In recent months, she said she bought gold as protection. Among other investment decisions, she also sold her stock positions.
Ms. Stefanova expects a recession to occur in the next year and a half and the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates further. That would prompt her to buy assets like gold and silver, she said.
""In this environment, it's important to have a diversified portfolio and not chase the highest level of returns,"" she said, ""because there is a much higher level of uncertainty.""

The Flash Mobs of Hong Kong,"Hong Kong -- I heard tear gas was filling the air and Molotov cocktails were flying, so I rushed to the scene. By the time I arrived in the Wan Chai commercial district Sunday night, demonstrators were retreating into the metro station. I followed them onto the train that took them to the next protest.
When Hong Kong's protests began in June in response to a bill allowing extradition to the mainland, they were orderly, scheduled and well-attended. Turnout twice exceeded a million. But as police have responded more violently, protesters changed tactics. Smaller groups rally at spur-of-the-moment demonstrations organized by word-of-mouth, on the Telegram messaging app, or on the LIHKG online forum.
The movement is leaderless. ""There is a variety of opinions and different people thinking of different strategies,"" says Isaac Cheng, a protester who is also vice chairman of the pro-democracy party DemosistÅ . ""Each person participating in the crowd can express their opinions and change the movement"" by making a persuasive case.
The ""flash mob"" protests make their statement, sometimes damage government property, and disappear -- with any luck, avoiding injuries and arrests. Nonetheless, participating is risky.
""I see you're another chemical engineer,"" an old man deadpans to me on the train Sunday, pointing to my industrial respirator. Almost all the protesters wear the same mask to protect themselves from tear gas. Its manufacturer, Minnesota-based 3M Co., did not respond to my inquiries but must be seeing a sales boom in Hong Kong. The respirator cartridges are Barbie pink, adding a splash of color to protesters' mostly black unofficial uniforms.
The masks muffle all verbal communication. Protesters have adapted by developing their own sign language. At the metro, some used almost comically huge gestures to urge others to join. On the front line they use hand signals for everything from goggles to water to the umbrellas they use to shield themselves from pepper spray and surveillance cameras.
The protesters piled out at Kwai Fong station shortly before 8 p.m. and congregated on the elevated platform. I asked one protester what the plan was. His shouted response sounded like a whisper through his mask. They were marching to a police station, but they needed more people.
Police stations are common protest sites. Chief Executive Carrie Lam has made few appearances since the crisis began, and the Legislative Council is out of session. ""There's really no one running the city right now except for police,"" says Jeffrey Ngo, a DemosistÅ activist who is studying at Georgetown but has spent his summer protesting at home. ""There's really no other sustainable way to keep the movement except to confront the police.""
The Kwai Fong protesters made me nervous as they waited on the platform. I saw at least one exit, but if police went on the offensive, everyone could be trapped. I hopped aboard a departing train, hoping to link up with another flash mob somewhere else in the city.
Explaining their new tactics, protesters say their spontaneity and disorganization make it harder for police to respond, and the crowds' smaller sizes reduce the likelihood of a crackdown with large casualties. On the other hand, a small group is easier to target. Police are the perennial threat, but plainclothes thugs with sticks and batons have also attacked. In dangerous neighborhoods, protesters use Apple's Airdrop file-sharing service to share maps of no-go zones and coordinate departure times.
Not long after I left Kwai Fong, officers stormed the metro station and fired tear gas, the first time they've deployed it indoors. Later I saw video from another metro station, where police beat protesters as they tried to board an escalator and fired pepper-spray balls at close range Sunday night.
The protests may be leaderless, but they're well-organized. Many demonstrations feature a special brigade to combat tear gas. They scoop canisters up with oven mitts and drop them in water-cooler tanks, suffocate them with a wok lid, or lob them back at police with badminton or tennis rackets. It's become popular to pop a traffic cone over the canisters. It acts as a chimney to prevent the gas from dispersing, and protesters pour water down the chute until it's extinguished.
Christian groups or elderly protesters try to defuse confrontations. Other protesters administer first aid or deliver messages. There's often even a cleanup squad. Demonstrators sometimes wrap their skin in cling wrap to protect against tear gas and pepper spray, and I spoke to one protester who was meticulously pulling the serrated edges out of empty boxes. He worried that police would accuse him of possessing a weapon when he dropped off the boxes for recycling.
Beijing is making ominous noises. On Monday, a government spokesman said ""the first signs of terrorism are starting to appear"" and wrongdoers would be punished ""without leniency, without mercy."" On Tuesday Ms. Lam said protesters risked pushing Hong Kong ""into an abyss."" China has staged flashy shows of force across the border in Shenzhen. Hong Kong police showcased water cannons this week. Protesters are brainstorming how to respond if officers use them. So far the only advice they've come up with is: Run.
Protesters appear unbowed. Jordan Pang of the Hong Kong University Student Union says students across the territory plan to strike in September. Most protesters expect police violence to continue escalating, but they don't think China will massacre them with tanks a la Tiananmen Square. They're betting their lives that the reputational and economic damage would be too much for Beijing to bear.
""It's like a civil war right now,"" says Alvin Yeung, a pro-democracy lawmaker. Before Hong Kongers took to the streets in June, he thought the extradition bill would pass, so ""I've stopped making predictions."" But he's learned ""never to underestimate Hong Kong people's imagination and creativity, as you can see.""

World News: Hong Kong Vigil Marks Tiananmen,"HONG KONG -- More than 180,000 people attended a vigil in Hong Kong to remember victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre 30 years ago, organizers said, equaling the record turnout for the event as locals also voiced anger over a tightening of their own freedoms.
Speakers led participants holding candles in chants calling for the end of one-party rule and for justice for the mass 1989 killing of Beijing protesters demanding democracy, felled by troops under orders from China's ruling Communist Party. The party in the past has branded the pro-democracy protests as ""counterrevolutionary turmoil.""
Attendance at the vigil was bolstered by anger among local citizens about shrinking freedoms in the former British colony, most recently a proposed extradition law that would allow suspects to be sent across the border to the mainland to face trial in China's more opaque legal system.
Such mass demonstrations are tolerated in Hong Kong, at least for now. In contrast, mention of the June 4 crackdown is heavily censored in China.
Local singer Anthony Wong gave a speech to the crowd for the first time, saying he felt compelled to stand up and oppose the law as well as the broader loss of Hong Kong's promised semiautonomy from Beijing's rule.
""For the past 30 years, I have never come on this stage. I am not used to joining protests or chanting slogans,"" he said, before singing a song called ""Memories of Guilt.""
The Hong Kong government has stressed that it will safeguard the city's freedoms. Opponents including business groups and teachers say the extradition law compromises the ""One Country, Two Systems"" policy under which Beijing promised to preserve human rights and freedoms in the city until 2047.
Hong Kong police put the turnout at 37,000, more than double last year's estimate. There are always vast discrepancies between the numbers given by police and the organizers. Organizers said the turnout at least matched previous records in 2012 and 2014, two years when society was similarly divided over political proposals blamed on Beijing.
The 1989 slaughter of Beijing protesters has a special resonance in Hong Kong, inspiring many of the city's prominent pro-democracy leaders to activism ever since. At the vigil, organizers led bows of respect for the deceased.
""Who knows if we can still come out to do this next year,"" said Karen Chan, 34 years old, a Hong Kong administrative worker who said she had attended every year since 2014, the year city residents staged their own 79-day pro-democracy mass street protests, which ended in failure. ""We have to take a stand for freedom, democracy and justice while we still can.""
A 53-year-old visitor, originally from the Chinese province of Shanxi who now teaches in Cambodia, attended the gathering in Hong Kong for her first time.
""It is so encouraging to arrive in Hong Kong and witness this,"" said Ms. Gao, who three decades ago participated in the student movement in her Northern China hometown. She would give only her last name, citing fear of retribution from the government.
""The blood of our generations did not go to waste,"" she said.

"Hong Kong, Unmasked","The rule of law has taken a battering in Hong Kong this year, and this week Chief Executive Carrie Lam dealt it another blow as she exercised emergency powers for the first time since Britain handed over the colony to China.
Ms. Lam invoked the Emergency Regulations Ordinance to prohibit any face covering ""that is likely to prevent identification"" at rallies, marches, assemblies or riots. The ban takes effect Oct. 5 and extends to the tear-gas masks protesters have worn to protect themselves from the police, and face paint used to thwart facial-recognition technology. Violators could get a year in prison.
Ms. Lam says this doesn't mean Hong Kong is in a state of emergency. Semantics aside, what Hong Kongers really fear is what may come next. The emergency provision Ms. Lam cites allows the chief executive to enact ""any regulations whatsoever"" deemed ""desirable in the public interest."" That includes censorship, arrests, the seizure of private property and restrictions on other rights.
The government has griped about protesters covering their faces, even as the police have often ignored their own department guidelines by refusing to identify themselves to the public. There has been little accountability for police who have used excessive force.
Since June more than 1,800 protesters have been arrested. That includes some who have damaged property or brawled with police. But more than a dozen were arrested in recent days for inflating black balloons on the street to protest 70 years of communist dictatorship in China.
The overwhelming majority of Hong Kongers have behaved in a lawful and orderly way, but the government's contempt for its own people is convincing growing numbers that peaceful protest won't yield the autonomy they were promised. That is a dangerous turn because violence and vandalism will undermine the moral authority of the protest movement. The ultimate responsibility still lies with Ms. Lam and her masters in Beijing whose decisions created the chaos now engulfing Hong Kong."
"U.S. News: Pence Assails NBA, Nike Over China","WASHINGTON -- Vice President Mike Pence took on Nike Inc. and the National Basketball Association, accusing them of being complicit in China's efforts to curtail democracy in Hong Kong.
His comments came Thursday in a speech to a Washington think tank, where the vice president called China a strategic and economic rival and criticized Beijing's treatment of Muslim minorities in his strongest terms yet. He also slammed the NBA for its response to a tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey supporting the protests in Hong Kong, which the league called ""regrettable.""
""In siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime,"" Mr. Pence said.
The NBA never apologized for the incident and resisted pressure to punish Mr. Morey. Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James did criticize Mr. Morey in a tweet, saying the team executive's support for antigovernment protesters was ""misinformed or not really educated on the situation"" in Hong Kong. Mr. James has a lifetime endorsement deal with Nike, which also didn't escape the vice president's lash.
""Nike promotes itself as a so-called social-justice champion, but when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door,"" Mr. Pence said.
Earlier this year, Nike stores in China halted sales of sneakers made by a Japanese partner after the designer provoked an outcry on Chinese social media by posting a photo in support of protesters.
Nike didn't respond to a request to comment.
Following Mr. Morey's tweet, Chinese institutions suspended ties with the Rockets. Democrats and Republicans united to criticize the NBA for not defending Mr. Morey's right to free speech and for appearing to cave to Chinese economic pressure.
After realizing the league's initial statement was insufficient, NBA commissioner Adam Silver was more forceful in defending American values. A bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.), wrote a letter urging Mr. Silver to suspend the NBA's activities in China.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal this week, Mr. Silver said that isolationism wasn't an option for the NBA, and that he felt the league had no choice but to pursue diplomacy in China. ""I hear some people saying that we should disengage from China, and I respectfully disagree,"" Mr. Silver said.
Not long after Mr. Pence's comments, Mr. Morey tweeted for the first time since releasing a statement about his pro-Hong Kong tweet. His tweets on Thursday were strictly about basketball: The Rockets were set to begin their season on Thursday night.

World News: Hong Kong Authorities Charge Dozens With Rioting,"HONG KONG -- Authorities on Tuesday charged 44 people with rioting, an offense that can carry a multiyear prison sentence, as the city's Beijing-backed government takes a tougher stance to try to restore order after weeks of increasingly volatile protests.
It was the first time officials used the charge since their move to win legislative approval for a bill authorizing extradition to the mainland drew as many as two million people onto the streets and plunged the city into political crisis in early June.
Soon after the charges became known, hundreds of people swarmed a police station in the urban district of Kwai Chung, where some of those charged were being held. They were protesting the decision, underscoring the risks the government faces of provoking further unrest with a harsh response.
Near midnight, dozens of protesters faced off with police wearing riot gear outside the police station, with videos on local media showing many in pouring rain chanting ""release the martyrs.""
On Wednesday morning, hundreds outside a courtroom where some of the suspects were to appear chanted ""release the honorable fighters.""
The rioting charges came a day after Beijing's top office for Hong Kong affairs held a rare news conference to publicly support the city's government and urge authorities to punish violent protesters and restore order.
Neither Beijing nor Hong Kong's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has signaled they are prepared to make further concessions that even some pro-Beijing figures in the city say are necessary to help quell the troubles.
In recent weeks, the city has been gripped in a worsening spiral of violence between police and protesters that marks the biggest social and political crisis in the former British colony since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Although Mrs. Lam suspended the controversial extradition bill that sparked the demonstrations, many opponents have continued to regularly hold protests that have widened to oppose Beijing's tightening restrictions on the city's freedoms.
On Sunday, a central district in Hong Kong became an urban battlefield as police shot rounds of tear gas to disperse protesters and began making rapid arrests. Police said protesters attacked officers at the scene with bricks and sharpened iron rods.
Many had marched to the district after officials restricted the protest route, even though the protesters were warned that their actions constituted illegal assembly.
Police arrested 32 men and 17 women, aged between 16 and 41. Of those, 45 were charged, including 44 with rioting, police said Tuesday. One person was charged with possession of offensive weapons.
Digital fliers begun circulating on the Telegram messaging app urging them to rally outside the court.
Declaring protests riots has been opposed by activists because of the tough prison sentences the rioting charge can bring.

World News: Beijing Decries Social-Media Curbs,"China's government pushed back against moves by Twitter Inc. and Facebook Inc. to curb accounts the companies said were part of a state-sponsored disinformation campaign against Hong Kong protesters, saying the posts were simply Chinese citizens overseas expressing their views.
These citizens, including students, ""have the rights to express their opinions and viewpoints,"" China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Tuesday.
Twitter on Monday said it took down 936 accounts linked to a ""significant state-backed information operation"" originating in China. ""These accounts were deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong, including undermining the legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement on the ground,"" Twitter wrote in a blog post.
Facebook said that following a tip from Twitter, it removed five accounts along with seven pages, with a reach of more than 15,000 accounts, as well as three groups that included more than 2,000 members.

World News: Hard-Liner Toughens Police Response --- Hong Kong official Alan Lau steers force toward aggressive tactics on protesters,"HONG KONG -- When Hong Kong's embattled police force announced it was bringing out of retirement a former officer known to support hard-line crackdowns on protesters, many here expected to see a new level of violence against pro-democracy demonstrations.
They were right.
In the few days since former Deputy Commissioner Alan Lau returned to the force, police have charged protesters inside a subway station, whacking them repeatedly with billy clubs and blasting away with pepper balls as they tumbled down the escalators. They fired tear gas into another station, incapacitating passengers as the gas accumulated on the concourse. They unleashed sprinting ""snatch squads"" to arrest dozens of protesters as they fled. And they dressed up as black-clad, yellow-helmeted protesters themselves, popping up to grab surprised marchers who thought they were safe.
The new intensity and tactics have led to a surge in arrests and a shift in attitude for a force that had been repeatedly caught flat-footed by protesters' fast-changing tactics. But it has also turned the city's mood against the tactics as television channels broadcast images that many decided were unnecessarily brutal.
Video of a female protester writhing on the ground after being injured in the face sparked outrage this week, including a protest that shut down the city's airport Monday and Tuesday. Doctors and nurses, incensed by the level of police force, staged sit-ins in hospitals, many wearing an eye patch in solidarity with the woman, who suffered an as-yet-unspecified eye injury.
""The violence isn't right, and we're here to say, 'No,'"" said Jonathan Fang, a cardiologist who participated in a hospital sit-in. Around him doctors and nurses in blue scrubs and wearing white eye bandages sat cross-legged outside a large public hospital, holding cardboard signs.
The police force itself is divided over the tactics, one senior serving police officer said. While pleased they have greater powers at their disposal, officers worry the harsh government response has set back police relations with the community by several decades.
""It's hard to see the positive,"" the officer said. ""[Mr. Lau] is here to carry the can for the hard approach.""
A Hong Kong police spokesman said Tuesday officers had no choice but to use force to quell violence that broke out across the city in recent weekends. The police didn't make Mr. Lau available to comment.
The stepped-up intensity results from a police force given new latitude to engage protesters after Mr. Lau's return, longtime police observers said. The veteran officer ran operations when police fired tear gas at a peaceful mass sit-in of pro-democracy protesters in 2014. Mr. Lau was also in command two years later when a protest by street hawkers devolved into a riot, leading to clashes.
A clean-cut, bespectacled man, Mr. Lau has kept a low public profile as protests escalated in recent days. Internally, however, police have been briefed in hourslong meetings about a new zero-tolerance approach to the protests, including a green light to contain and arrest demonstrators that replaces the previous goal of dispersing them, the senior officer said.
""The return of Mr. Lau made clear the intention of escalating police violence in order to suppress the protests,"" said Albert Ho, a longtime Hong Kong human-rights lawyer.
Hong Kong's local government is making almost no effort at a political resolution to the unrest now in its 10th week. Its strategy rests almost solely on hopes law enforcement can restore control, observers and analysts say.
At a news conference Tuesday, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam told reporters it wasn't her job to give orders to the police, whose job it is to safeguard order.

EXCHANGE --- Hollywood's Hard Lessons For the NBA in China,"The first time James Harden apologized to China, it had nothing to do with Hong Kong protests, Beijing's pressure on the NBA or upholding the pillars of democracy. It was all because of an unfortunate scooter incident.
One of the world's most powerful economies rolled out the red carpet for one of the NBA's best players when the Houston Rockets superstar visited China this past summer. Mr. Harden wore the flamboyant robes of Peking Opera dress to honor the local culture, and Chinese kids wore beards to honor his marvelous facial hair. It was yet another successful promotional tour hawking Adidas sneakers.
And then he was pulled over by Shanghai police. Mr. Harden was caught riding an electric scooter the wrong way on a local street, a common mistake for an unsuspecting foreigner. He knew what to do next.
""I would like to apologize for violating traffic rules during my scooter ride today,"" Mr. Harden wrote on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter.
He would find himself in a similar position this past week: apologizing to China for an offense that most people in the U.S. would not find offensive.
The NBA's showdown in China isn't simply about how business works in the world's largest autocracy. It's also about how celebrities manage their lucrative global brands, with NBA stars now among the world's most recognizable figures. These players are now absorbing an unofficial Chinese rulebook for public figures that Hollywood celebrities have been studying for the past 20 years.
The NBA was thrust into a geopolitical storm this week with a quickly deleted tweet by Rockets general manager Daryl Morey supporting protests in Hong Kong. The tweet drew the wrath of China's government, and Chinese fans quickly cut ties with one of the country's most popular NBA teams. The NBA's response, which supported freedom of expression but acknowledged the offense it caused, was attacked in the U.S. as an insufficient defense of free speech and in China as an insufficient apology.
The players had their own economic interests in China to worry about. LeBron James, who was stuck in China this week as the crisis unfolded, has a lifetime endorsement deal with Nike that his business partner has suggested is worth more than $1 billion. He's also the producer and star of ""Space Jam 2,"" which is expected to have enormous international commercial appeal when it's released in 2021.
Mr. Harden, who has a $200 million sneaker contract with Adidas, met with the media along with his teammate Russell Westbrook as tensions mounted this week. They suddenly faced a dilemma that would have been tricky even for a trained diplomat. Once again Mr. Harden said he was sorry.
""We apologize,"" he said. ""We love China. We love playing there. For both of us individually, we go there once or twice a year. They show us the most important love. We appreciate them as a fan base, and we love everything they're about.""
The NBA's stumble in China has a dramatic prequel: Hollywood's early foray into the Chinese market came with its own collisions of free speech and authoritarian politics with billions of dollars at stake.
The movie business's big flare-up came in 1997, when two movies about a young Dalai Lama premiered in the U.S., Sony Pictures Entertainment's ""Seven Years in Tibet"" and Walt Disney Co.'s ""Kundun."" The Chinese box office was an afterthought to Hollywood studios at the time, only a handful of movies were imported each year, but China made it clear it did not appreciate Hollywood producing sympathetic portrayals of the Dalai Lama, who has represented a challenge to Chinese sovereignty for decades since the Buddhist leader was forced to flee Tibet in 1959.
The studios found themselves in a similar lose-lose situation as the NBA. If they bowed to China's demands, they risked angering Americans who saw it as a curtailing of free speech. But if they released the movies as planned, they faced the possibility of larger business pursuits in the country going nowhere.
The movies were released within a few months of one another, and Beijing made good on its threat. Sony and Disney movies were rejected from entering the country. The message from Beijing: If you want our money, stay out of our internal affairs.
Both studios eventually caved to China by apologizing profusely. Sony sent a delegation of executives to meet with government officials and smooth things over. Disney CEO Michael Eisner met with Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji the following year. ""We made a stupid mistake,"" Mr. Eisner said, according to a transcript of the meeting. ""The bad news is that the film was made; the good news is that nobody watched it. Here I want to apologize, and in the future we should prevent this sort of thing, which insults our friends, from happening.""
Hollywood's groveling worked. Sony and Disney movies were soon flowing into China again.
The political considerations of doing business in China were quickly baked into Hollywood strategy. Stars promoting new movies in Shanghai and Beijing are now given a list of Do's and Don'ts for taking questions. Answers that show an affinity for the local culture are preferred. Tibet and Tiananmen Square are strictly taboo.
Celebrities have learned the hard way what happens if they slip up. When Angelina Jolie was promoting Disney's ""Maleficent"" in Shanghai in 2014, she was asked who her favorite Chinese director was.
""I am not sure if you consider Ang Lee Chinese, he's Taiwanese, but he does many Chinese-language films with many Chinese artists and actors,"" she said. The mere suggestion of doubt that Taiwan is part of China angered the public, prompting some calls to boycott Ms. Jolie's movies. China did allow Ms. Jolie's then-husband Brad Pitt into the country for the first time since the ""Tibet"" film, but he stayed out of sight. Ms. Jolie told reporters he was learning to make dumplings.
NBA stars are navigating similar dilemmas today. The best players have deals with shoe companies worth hundreds of millions of dollars, in part because China is the biggest source of growth in the sneaker industry. By taking a stance against Beijing, they can alienate the entire market. The problem is that they have projected themselves as public ambassadors in recent years, sharing their opinions on political issues that hit close to home.
""I can't imagine the pressure the players feel at this point knowing what they can and can't say,"" said Matt Halfhill, the founder of the sneaker news site Nice Kicks.
This generation of NBA players, who were born around the time the league began airing on Chinese state-run television, has been conditioned to view this authoritarian state as an important partner, said Sonny Vaccaro, a longtime sports-marketing executive. NBA commissioner Adam Silver liked to brag that more basketball was being played and watched in China than anywhere else in the world. The three most popular jerseys in China last year belonged to LeBron James (Nike), Stephen Curry (Under Armour) and James Harden (Adidas), while Chinese apparel brands Anta, Li Ning and Peak have their own endorsement deals with NBA players.
Some players, like Mr. James of the Los Angeles Lakers, have Hollywood interests to worry about as well. Mr. James's production company, SpringHill Entertainment, has more than a dozen film and television projects in development. The company just wrapped production on ""Space Jam 2,"" a sequel to the 1996 animated hit starring Michael Jordan and cartoon characters like Bugs Bunny. At AT&T Inc.'s Warner Bros., the movie is considered a likely candidate for distribution in China, according to people familiar with the matter.
Mr. James could jeopardize that effort and stoke China's wrath with one slip of the tongue because the off-screen conduct of celebrities often matters as much to state censors as what's on screen. When Lady Gaga met with the Dalai Lama in 2016, Chinese fans lashed out at the singer on social media, and authorities ordered her music off streaming services.
The NBA set its sights on China's potential at a time when the country's middle class -- about the size of the entire U.S. population -- was moving to cities, using the internet to learn about Western movie stars and athletes and dramatically opening itself to the world.
But no business takes off in China without the tacit support of the government. Beijing authorities issued a decree in 2014 designed to boost the country's sports and exercise industries, with the goal that 500 million Chinese citizens would be playing sports by 2025. And there were few sports more important to this plan than basketball.
""Carry forward the Olympic spirit and the spirit of Chinese sports, and practice the core values of socialism,"" the decree stated.
It might seem like wishful thinking to order more than a billion people to work out more, but such legislation often serves as a greenlight to businesses to invest in those sectors. The flood of Chinese money into Hollywood around 2013 was prompted in part when the government included arts and overseas investment as priorities in official plans. The sports guidelines reduced the corporate income tax for sports companies, loosened regulation around sports development and encouraged the purchase of broadcast rights for games.
True success in China comes when a commercial craze overlaps with a government mandate, and the NBA's move into China was routinely cited by other industries as the smoothest of any Western brand -- at least until this week.
After his apology and declaration of love for China, Mr. Harden is still a draw on Shanghai's main shopping avenue, where a looping video of him was the featured display in Adidas's flagship store this week. When he was asked Thursday whether he felt comfortable speaking on political events in the future, a spokeswoman for the Rockets answered as he remained silent.
""Basketball questions only,"" she said.
The NBA canceled the remaining media sessions for players and coaches in China the next day.

World News: Hong Kong Near 'Breakdown',"HONG KONG -- Antigovernment protesters wreaked havoc on the city for a second straight day, with train services disrupted, schools closed and roads blocked a day after one of the bloodiest episodes of unrest in more than five months of demonstrations.
Protesters and police clashed across Hong Kong on Tuesday, including at universities and train stations, and in the city's financial district.
The violence intensified into the night, particularly at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where police fired tear gas, water cannon and nonlethal rounds at protesters, mostly students, who countered by throwing petrol bombs.
Videos circulating on social media showed a scene that was reminiscent of a battlefield, with fires and thick clouds of smoke hovering above the campus. Reports suggested more than 60 people were injured at the university. Shortly after 10 p.m., police said that they would retreat from the scene.
The action showed neither side appears willing to back down. Protesters for the past few days have embraced causing citywide disruptions while Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has emphasized that increased violence won't prompt the government to yield to protesters' demands.
""Over the past two days, our society has been pushed to the brink of a total breakdown,"" a senior Hong Kong police official said at a news conference Tuesday. The police said they had arrested 287 people, ages 12 to 82, on Monday.
Earlier Tuesday, police also fired tear gas and nonlethal rounds at City University of Hong Kong, including near the student dormitories, after protesters built barricades in the area. Dozens of riot police were also at another college, the University of Hong Kong, where protesters threw bricks and chairs from a pedestrian bridge, causing traffic jams and hitting vehicles.
Matthew Evans, a science faculty member at HKU, said he is worried about the presence of police on campus. He said protesters throwing rocks wouldn't solve problems either.
""What is happening now is not sustainable,"" he said. ""What happens is that the police come, there is a fight, people get arrested. And then tomorrow it starts all over again. Maybe not here, somewhere else. There's not an end. It needs to end somehow.""
A day earlier, police shot a protester, the third injured by police gunfire since the demonstrations began in June. He was in serious condition Tuesday afternoon, upgraded from critical, according to the Hospital Authority. The protester, identified by friends as Patrick Chow, was arrested on accusations of unlawful assembly, according to a person familiar with the proceedings.
A man who was set on fire on Monday after arguing with demonstrators remained in critical condition on Tuesday afternoon. The police said they are classifying the case as attempted murder.
The U.S. State Department said it was watching the situation in Hong Kong ""with grave concern"" and urged the city's government to build a dialogue with the public to address the underlying concerns and the protesters to respond to those efforts.
The protests, initially sparked by an extradition bill, have morphed into a broader antigovernment movement. Many demonstrators are focusing their anger on alleged police brutality.

Pro-China Trolls Put Pressure On NBA,"LeBron James wasn't the only Twitter user who thought Daryl Morey's tweet supporting Hong Kong's protesters was misinformed. There was an army of pro-China troll accounts that happened to agree.
A review of nearly 170,000 tweets, plus analysis from expert information warfare researchers, show that Mr. Morey was the target of what appears to be a coordinated campaign after his tweet on Oct. 4 set off an international furor and threatened the NBA's future in the world's most populous country.
In the 12 hours immediately after Mr. Morey's tweet, the Houston Rockets general manager's account was flooded with comments from pro-Chinese-government accounts that mentioned him more than 16,000 times, according to an analysis by Ben Nimmo, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab.
""It looks like there were humans at the keyboard for many of these posts,"" Mr. Nimmo said. ""This wasn't primarily a bot swarm. It was a troll mob.""
The Wall Street Journal's analysis was based on 168,907 tweets at Mr. Morey between Oct. 4 and Oct. 10 captured by Clemson University researchers Darren Linvill and Patrick Warren.
It shows that 22% came from accounts with 0 followers at some point last week and 50% were from accounts with fewer than 13 followers. There were 4,855 total users in all who had never tweeted until they replied to Mr. Morey, and 3,677 accounts didn't exist until his tweet.
""I'm not saying this is a state-affiliated operation,"" Mr. Linvill said. ""But I've only seen so many brand-new accounts used at one time when it was a state-affiliated operation.""
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn't respond to a request for comment.
Troll mobs can involve orchestrated activity by a group of people who run accounts -- and often many accounts. Sometimes they also operate armies of coordinated accounts to supplement their messaging.
At the peak of the troll activity in response to Mr. Morey's tweet, which supported the protesters demonstrating against China's crackdown on the semiautonomous city of Hong Kong, the notifications on Mr. Morey's phone appeared at a rate of nearly two per second. More than 4,700 of the replies that swarmed his account included the phrase ""NMSL,"" which is a Chinese acronym meaning ""your mother is dead."" Some of those tweets were accompanied by heart emojis.
Mr. Morey deleted his tweet in less than an hour after it had become clear that he'd stoked China's wrath. But nearly 36 hours later, the powerful autocracy unleashed a delayed wave of economic pressure directed at the Rockets and the NBA. The trolls intensified their efforts.
China's state-run institutions suspended ties with the Rockets on Oct. 6, when Mr. Morey returned to Twitter to say he didn't intend to cause offense. That is also when the replies to Mr. Morey spiked. There were nearly four times as many tweets in the five hours after Mr. Morey's response than in the five hours after his original tweet.
The height of the activity came when most of the U.S. was sleeping and China was bustling. The six hours between 10 p.m. ET on Oct. 6 and 4 a.m. ET produced 30,695 tweets mentioning Mr. Morey, or 18% of the total.
Twitter is banned in China, but people can access the service using a virtual private network, or VPN, which encrypts and reroutes internet traffic. In the past, some accounts have accessed the platform from specific unblocked IP addresses originating in China, Twitter has said.
When it comes to information warfare, China tends to be defensive and engage on issues relating to sovereignty, according to the researchers, while a country like Russia is more aggressive and inflames online discussions of polarizing topics such as NFL quarterbacks kneeling during the national anthem. ""They don't care about Colin Kaepernick,"" Mr. Linvill said. ""They just want you to talk about Colin Kaepernick.""
The objective in this troll attack was likely to manipulate the conversation about the Hong Kong protests, the Clemson researchers said. Of the accounts targeting Mr. Morey tweeting for the first time, a high percentage espoused pro-China, anti-Hong Kong propaganda, which defied the pro-Hong Kong rhetoric found in the majority of accounts they analyzed. That suggests it was a concerted effort to make the discourse appear balanced -- even if the organic discussion was lopsided against Beijing's interests.
Twitter first identified China as a source of a disinformation campaign in August, when the company suspended accounts the company believed to be part of a Chinese effort to undermine antigovernment protests in Hong Kong. In that instance, Twitter took down 936 accounts linked to a ""significant state-backed information operation"" originating in China.
The company has taken action against some of the most egregious violations of Twitter rules since Mr. Morey's first tweet. One account called ""Support the division of the United States,"" which followed zero users and had zero followers, tweeted at Mr. Morey an image of the World Trade Center crumbling on Sept. 11, 2001. The account has since been suspended.
""Coordinated activity and other forms of platform manipulation have no place on our service,"" a spokesman for Twitter said.
There is no U.S. sports league that has reaped the benefits of social media as much as the NBA. Now it is feeling the consequences.
The league is still dealing with the fallout of last week's crisis. U.S. politicians criticized the league's response to the situation as it escalated. And none other than LeBron James called Mr. Morey's tweet ""misinformed.""
Mr. Morey, a prolific tweeter when he hasn't enraged a foreign superpower, hasn't tweeted since.

Protests Keep Pressure on Beijing --- Hong Kong rallies continue after unpopular extradition bill is suspended,"HONG KONG -- An attempt by Hong Kong's leader to push a Beijing-backed extradition bill galvanized unprecedented resistance to tighter mainland control, presenting Chinese President Xi Jinping with the most high-profile challenge yet to his authority.
On Sunday, a huge crowd of protesters flooded central Hong Kong, capping a week of demonstrations and at times violent confrontations between protesters and police. Organizers estimated the crowd at nearly two million people and said it was the biggest rally Hong Kong has seen since China reclaimed sovereignty of the city from Britain in 1997, though police put the figures substantially lower.
The day before, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam had indefinitely suspended the bill, and on Sunday she apologized for mishandling it. The bill would have allowed extraditions to mainland China for trial in its more opaque justice system. The abrupt about-face wasn't enough to satisfy the black-clad protesters, who shut down major city streets, demanding Mrs. Lam permanently shelve the plan and resign.
Beijing is seeking to project an image of strength and stability as it grapples with an economic slowdown and a bitter trade conflict with the U.S. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that President Donald Trump might raise the Hong Kong issue with President Xi at the G-20 meeting later this month.
China has drawn international outcry over its Muslim crackdown in Xinjiang and criticism of its 'One Belt, One Road' development program as a ""debt trap"". It is also under attack from U.S. officials who accuse China's telecommunications giant Huawei of being a tool of the government.
Mrs. Lam's ""willingness to step backwards suggests that Beijing never wanted this problem, that it hurts their bigger issues"" such as U.S. trade negotiations and relations with Taiwan, said David Zweig, Director of Transnational China Consulting Limited.
Upheaval in Hong Kong -- long a key to China's trade and business with the West -- could seriously set back its long-term goal of fully incorporating the city without setting off civil unrest, and potentially risk inspiring similar actions in mainland China. President Xi's goal of reintegrating Taiwan into the mainland has also suffered a setback.
Mrs. Lam, a 39-year civil servant, has said she initiated the bill herself after receiving emotional letters from a woman whose daughter was murdered in Taiwan. The suspect fled to Hong Kong, which doesn't have an extradition treaty with Taiwan.
Mrs. Lam was also trying to fulfill a long-held wish from her political bosses in Beijing, who had for years wanted an extradition arrangement with Hong Kong. The city's Western-style justice system is firewalled from China's.
In combining the two issues, Mrs. Lam underestimated how deep-rooted distrust was of Beijing among ordinary people, and even businessmen who she usually counted on as allies. While Hong Kong has periodically tussled with Beijing over the boundaries of its political and legal autonomy over the years, this time was different.
Facing the most widespread public backlash in 22 years of Chinese rule, Mrs. Lam traveled across the border to Shenzhen on Friday to meet with mainland Chinese officials. She returned with a plan to try to restore order, while saving face.
Suspending the bill, rather than withdrawing it, allows China's government to characterize the protests in Hong Kong as a result of miscommunication and foreign incitement, rather than misguided policy-making. China's Foreign Ministry and state media have repeatedly accused the U.S. and other Western governments of meddling in Hong Kong affairs.
The bill rejuvenated dissent in a society that was divided and demoralized after a failed mass street occupation demanding greater democracy from Beijing in 2014.
""This case shows that Hong Kong society has developed strong defenses against direct attacks on its existing freedoms by Beijing, and Beijing has not found a way to take existing rights away without risking large scale turmoil and bloodshed,"" said Ho-fung Hung, a professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins University.
George Magnus, author of the book ""Red Flags: Why Xi's China Is in Jeopardy"" and a research associate at Oxford University's China Centre, said that perhaps Beijing didn't want to go to the G-20 summit later this month with a major social and political eruption in Hong Kong.
""They have handed temporary propaganda and political kudos to the dissenters,"" he said. Still, ""you'd have to be naively optimistic to think this is the endgame.""
Beijing had anointed Mrs. Lam, 62, to build bridges with the public, after her unpopular predecessor was tarnished by his role in quashing the 2014 protests. Mrs. Lam, who was deputy back then, had previously run social welfare in the city and was seen to be a more sympathetic character to the public. When taking office, she pledged to heal social divisions.
People who work closely with her describe her as forceful and stubborn, a workaholic who sleeps only a few hours a night, determined to push through her agenda. Traveling around the city in a black sedan with only the region's bauhinia flower emblem as the license plate, she is known as a dedicated civil servant with a stern and can-do manner, while some have said that she's been accustomed to following her own instincts.
The extradition issue became a priority after a crime that occurred more than a year ago, when a Hong Kong man traveled to Taiwan with his pregnant girlfriend and allegedly strangled her there. Dumping her body in a pink suitcase in bushes, he fled back to Hong Kong, where authorities were at a loss on what to do. They couldn't send him back to Taiwan to face trial because there is no extradition agreement between the two jurisdictions.
After receiving five letters from the victim's mother, Mrs. Lam has said felt she had to take action. Early in the year, she sat down at a weekly meeting at her harborfront offices, and told her advisers she wanted to change the law to enable the man's extradition as soon as July.
As Mrs. Lam tells it, time was of the essence. The accused murderer was held by Hong Kong authorities on money laundering charges for allegedly using his slain girlfriend's credit card, and it was important to push the bill through before his release, officials have said.
Citing that, Mrs. Lam's administration made a series of decisions that further inflamed people: she skipped the usual public consultation, fast-tracked the legislation bypassing a lawmaker scrutiny committee and repeatedly brushed aside criticism of the bill.
People in Beijing briefed on the matter say that while Chinese officials embraced the idea of closer extradition cooperation, judicial and law-enforcement authorities hadn't regarded it as a priority. Chinese authorities have in the past circumvented Hong Kong's judicial processes in detaining booksellers and a businessman from the territory -- moves indicating that mainland officials felt they could act in Beijing's interests without serious impediment, the people say.
In February, after the amendments to the bill were introduced, the public was given 20 days to respond, much less than is typical.
By early March, the government had received 4,500 responses, including objections from normally loyal business groups. Some local businessmen were privately concerned that their past mainland activities, such as gift-giving, tax evasion or outright bribery when such activities were common, may land them in trouble. The government cut a number of economic crimes from the list to pacify them.
Still, pro-democracy legislators seized on the law, which they saw as China breaking its promise to give Hong Kong legal autonomy until 2047.
On May 9, when Mrs. Lam gave a speech explaining the bill to lawmakers, opposition members interrupted her. A pro-democracy leader, Claudia Mo, slammed her hands on the table and proclaimed, ""Liar! You're a liar!"" before being kicked out of the meeting.
An extradition clause was deliberately left out of a constitutional agreement governing Hong Kong because the legal systems were deemed too far apart, according to Martin Lee, a lawyer involved in negotiations of the handover treaty between China and the U.K.
China has a secretive, conviction-loaded justice system that differs in almost every way from Hong Kong's common law system, developed on the British model. Chinese officials also have a history of using its courts as a tool against political dissidents, as well as for mistreating suspects and denying access to lawyers. In Hong Kong, suspects are presumed innocent and entitled to trials that meet international standards of fairness.
Mr. Lee, the lawyer, traveled to Washington, D.C. to raise the alarm. Mr. Lee met Mr. Pompeo.
Soon, U.S. congressmen and British politicians issued more warnings that the bill was a threat to Hong Kong's status. In a June 5 meeting with the heads of international business groups who aired grievances over the bill, Mrs. Lam told them that they didn't understand the law and what it meant, according to a person present.
By the end of April, a march against the bill attracted 130,000 people, organizers said, the most in recent years and signaling a tipping point in public sentiment. Mrs. Lam interpreted the modest turnout as a sign she could press ahead, a person familiar with her thinking said.
An umbrella opposition group called a mass march for June 9; thousands used social media and more secure channels such as Telegram to mobilize. Protesters waved placards: ""It'll be Game Over for Hong Kong!"" and ""We've Been Betrayed.""
Mrs. Lam was undaunted. The mostly pro-Beijing legislature had set the bill on a fast track to start debate on Wednesday, June 12, aiming to wrap up a vote by June 20.
With protesters swarming government offices Wednesday, legislators postponed the debate and police later moved in, raining down tear gas and firing rubber bullets.
Mrs. Lam issued a statement by video calling for calm. Privately, she was up late, in touch with her advisers through the night, associates say.
Mrs. Lam canceled public appearances, including a long-scheduled interview at a Wall Street Journal tech conference in Hong Kong. By Friday, almost all pro-government voices all had the same message: there was a need to calm things down. By Saturday afternoon, Mrs. Lam said she'd suspend the bill indefinitely.
Still, she didn't back down completely, insisting the extradition bill was needed to stop the city becoming a safe haven for fugitives. She blamed public outrage on the government failing to explain it.
Mrs. Lam ended the week with none of her goals achieved, her relations with Hong Kong's people shattered and an anxious Beijing looking over her shoulder. Colleagues say the bill won't return until at least later next year, possibly never.
The alleged murderer could walk free as soon as this fall.

NBA Furor Rages on Official's Tweet on Hong Kong Protests,"The National Basketball Association scrambled late Sunday to contain an escalating crisis in China after a Houston Rockets executive's tweets supporting pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong sparked an international furor.
The league's carefully plotted strategic emphasis on China was jolted off course on Friday night when Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted an image with the words ""Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,"" in reference to the mass rallies against China's authoritarian government on the streets of the semiautonomous city. The Rockets are scheduled to play an exhibition outside Tokyo on Tuesday.
Mr. Morey quickly deleted the tweet, but the damage was done. Chinese sponsors pulled their money from the franchise, Chinese broadcast partners said they wouldn't air Rockets games and the Chinese Basketball Association suspended its ties with one of the NBA's best teams.
Mr. Morey tweeted again on Sunday night to explain that his views don't represent the team's or the league's. The NBA soon addressed the fallout for the first time, but the league quickly found itself under attack by American politicians on the left and right for its statement, which attempted to reaffirm the league's commitment to free speech but said it was ""regrettable"" that Mr. Morey's tweet had offended Chinese fans and partners.
""The values of the league support individuals' educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them,"" NBA spokesman Mike Bass said. ""We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together.""
It wasn't immediately clear how the Chinese government would respond.
The ferocious response to Mr. Morey's tweet and the NBA's response coincided with the league's top executives descending on China for preseason games in Shanghai and Shenzhen this week. LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers are scheduled to play the Brooklyn Nets, a team owned by Joseph Tsai, the billionaire co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. Mr. Tsai wrote on Facebook: ""The hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair.""
NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and the league's top brass were dealing with the crisis in Japan before they travel to China.
The rapidly unfolding series of events over the weekend pits democratic ideals against the influence of foreign money in a high-profile example of the difficulties American companies encounter when dealing with businesses in authoritarian China. It is already the most sensitive political situation that Mr. Silver has faced in his five years as commissioner.
The early wave of response in the U.S. brought criticism from across the political spectrum. Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) accused the NBA of ""shamefully retreating"" and said on Twitter that ""human rights shouldn't be for sale"" and ""the NBA shouldn't be assisting Chinese communist censorship."" Julian Castro, a Texan running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said ""China is using economic power to silence critics"" and that the U.S. must ""not allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government.""
The most forwarded comment on China's Weibo social-media platform in response to the NBA's statement featured an emoji of a chicken, meant as a profane euphemism, while a small number of users were calling for cancellation of the China games this week.
The unfolding crisis quickly challenged the NBA's yearslong effort to position itself as the most progressive of the major American sports leagues by encouraging free speech and spreading basketball around the world.
""I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,"" Mr. Morey wrote in his public response on Sunday. ""I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives. I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them wasn't my intention.""
There are billions of dollars at stake for the NBA. The league has long viewed China as the engine of future international growth and spent years courting the country's massive audience. It often boasts about the country's basketball population of 300 million players, and nearly 500 million people in China watched the NBA on Tencent's streaming platforms last season. The deciding game of last year's finals set a record for the largest streaming audience for an NBA game in China.
China has reciprocated by going crazy for basketball. The 12-hour time difference between the East Coast means fans can watch early NBA games on their phones during their morning commutes and stream West Coast games over lunch.
But the international basketball tournament overlapped with a period of unrest in Hong Kong. The protests erupted in June in an effort to press the city's government to formally withdraw an extradition bill that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face trial under its murky legal system. This was the 18th straight weekend of mass rallies, and there has been growing pressure for ordinary citizens and powerful companies to articulate whether they support the protests or Beijing.
NBA players and coaches have become comfortable in recent years voicing their political opinions about President Trump and issues like police brutality, systemic racism and gun violence, and the league has embraced its reputation for being socially conscious. But a potential showdown with a foreign government over the right to free speech with enormous financial consequences is far beyond the political complexities the NBA is used to navigating.
Mr. Morey is one of the league's most successful executives. He came to the NBA by way of a management-consulting firm and business school, and he has helped incite the data revolution that has swept professional sports as the public face of the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, the annual industry convention of sports quants. Mr. Morey was voted by his peers as the NBA's executive of the year in 2018 after building the Rockets into a perennial title contender.

World News: Demonstrators Clash With Police as Violence Mounts,"Hong Kong police deployed water cannons for the first time Sunday in a show of force as pro-democracy protests turned violent following nearly two weeks of relative calm.
Antigovernment demonstrators clashed with police in the New Territories on Sunday, hurling bricks and Molotov cocktails a day after police unleashed tear gas on protesters and some demonstrators threw firebombs at police. The 12th consecutive weekend of protests included some of the fiercest skirmishes yet between protesters and police.
Across town, in the central business district, the family members of some members of the police force gathered to criticize the government's handling of the situation and how police have been treated.
Two police trucks with water cannons were put in place Sunday evening -- and the water cannons were briefly turned on, though their streams fell slightly short of the protesters themselves. At the scene in Tsuen Wan, a New Territories neighborhood about 10 miles from central Hong Kong, protesters crouched behind makeshift barricades and threw firebombs and bricks at police.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam met with a range of leaders over the weekend, but none from groups that organized the biggest peaceful marches this summer that drew out millions in total, suggesting a resolution remains elusive.
At one frantic moment during Sunday's clashes, a police officer fired a gunshot into the sky during a skirmish with protesters. Video from the scene showed a group of protesters charging a number of policemen and beating them with rods and umbrellas. Police said one of the officers fell in the attack, leading six of his colleagues to pull their guns and one to fire the warning shot.
""Pointing the gun at the sky was the best option under a situation with no other choice,"" Senior Superintendent Yolanda Yu Hoi-kwan told reporters early Monday. Ms. Yu said that officers' lives were under threat and that the officer's decision to fire up upward was to prevent injuries to bystanders, journalists or protesters.
Ms. Yu said that 15 officers had been injured Sunday and that the radical demonstrators ""say they are protesters, but their actions have far left the bounds of acceptable or rational behavior.""
The Hong Kong police department said 65 arrests were made over the weekend, of people whose ages range from 12 to 52.
The latest developments have magnified the divide within the protest movement over whether peace or violence is a more effective strategy to get their demands addressed. The protests, first inspired by a bill that would have legalized extradition to mainland China from Hong Kong, have mushroomed into an antigovernment movement that is concerned by Beijing's increasing encroachment upon the semiautonomous city.
Protesters have focused their ire on Hong Kong's leader, Mrs. Lam, who many say hasn't done enough to address their demands, which include a permanent withdrawal of the extradition bill, full universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into police conduct.
Mrs. Lam met with more than a dozen politicians and academics in Hong Kong on Saturday, many of whom pressured her to make concessions to the protesters. But the group didn't include members of the Civil Human Rights Front, which has organized the biggest demonstrations. She posted on social media Saturday saying her administration wanted to start a dialogue with people regardless of class, color or age.
Protesters braved heavy rain on Sunday, gathering first at the Kwai Chung Sports Ground in the New Territories.
Li, a 25-year-old protester who works in marketing, said she didn't think government officials appeared genuine about resolving the issue. ""Their action is not the same as their words,"" Ms. Li said.

Activision Blizzard Is Getting Its Game Back,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
It has been a rough year for Activision Blizzard. But in the videogame world, fates can often turn on a dime.
A month ago, the videogame publisher was reeling from a controversy that embroiled it in the Hong Kong protests and, thus, in China's inscrutable domestic politics.
And that was just the latest blow to the company's Blizzard Entertainment unit, home to lucrative PC game franchises such as ""World of Warcraft"" and ""Diablo."" Activision's share price crashed last fall after it became clear Blizzard had no major releases planned for the year ahead.
Despite picking up more than 10% over the past three months, the stock is still down about one-third from its high just over a year ago.
But things are finally looking up for the company. Activision's latest ""Call of Duty"" release, dubbed ""Modern Warfare,"" went on sale two weeks ago and racked up more than $600 million in sales in its opening weekend, which the company says is a record for the franchise in the current generation of game consoles.
Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen, estimates the game will sell between 25 million and 27 million units this quarter.
Activision also launched the first true mobile version of the popular shooter franchise a few weeks before that, and it, too, was a hit. ""Call of Duty Mobile"" scored more than 100 million downloads initially, and the game is still among the top 10 grossing games on the iPhone more than a month after its launch, according to App Annie data.
Investors now have some visibility into the Blizzard pipeline. At its recent BlizzCon conference, the company revealed plans to launch full sequels to its ""Diablo"" and ""Overwatch"" games, as well as new expansion content for other franchises, such as ""World of Warcraft"" and ""Hearthstone."" Release dates for the sequels haven't been announced, but Wall Street is projecting sharp improvement in the Blizzard unit's financial performance, with adjusted net revenue expected to rise 21% in 2020 compared with a projected 28% drop this year.
That admittedly leaves a lot on the main Activision business in the meantime. Staples including ""Call of Duty"" and the mobile ""Candy Crush"" franchise tend to generate pretty reliable returns, but the company has long needed to diversify its offerings more -- especially following the loss of the underperforming ""Destiny"" franchise earlier this year.
Activision said in its third-quarter call Thursday that it plans to invest more in marketing and user acquisition in the current period, in part to build on the momentum behind its two strong ""Call of Duty"" games.
That will weigh on near-term profit, but it is the right move for a company finally coming in from the storm.

Videogame Giant Punishes Player,"Activision Blizzard Inc. suspended an esports competitor from one of its tournaments for backing antigovernment protesters in Hong Kong as tensions intensify between Beijing and the National Basketball Association over a similar expression of support.
Activision Blizzard, one of the world's biggest videogame companies, on Tuesday said in a blog post that ""Hearthstone"" competitor Ng Wai Chung, known as ""Blitzchung"" in the game, violated its rules that bar players from actions it considers offensive to a public group or that could damage the company's image.
The gamer, in a live online interview after winning a match on Sunday, said ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time,"" a slogan commonly associated with the protests. He wore a gas mask and goggles while he spoke. Hong Kong last week banned protesters from wearing masks.
Activision Blizzard said the player, who had no immediate comment, won't be allowed to compete in the second season of the digital card game's Grandmasters competition and will be banned from playing any of the game's company-run competitions for one year. He also lost the $7,000 awarded for making it into the tournament's second season.
A spokeswoman for California-based Activision Blizzard declined further comment.
""Hearthstone"" is one of the most popular franchises from the company's Blizzard Entertainment unit.
China is a big market for esports, though the segment globally still represents only a fraction of the videogame industry's roughly $150 billion in expected sales this year. Activision Blizzard's decision to suspend the esports competitor also comes when the company is seeking Beijing's approval to release a new ""Call of Duty"" game in the country.
The company's move against the ""Hearthstone"" player brings risks of its own. After the punishment was announced, the hashtag #boycottblizzard began trending on Twitter.

Business News: Gucci's Troubles Cool Off Growth --- Hong Kong turmoil and blackface scandal lead to slowest sales pace in over three years,"PARIS -- Sales growth at Gucci slowed to its lowest level in more than three years, as protests in Hong Kong and the aftermath of the brand's blackface scandal took their toll on the Italian fashion house.
The results, however, surpassed analysts' expectations, in a sign that Gucci began to stabilize operations, particularly in the U.S.
Gucci sales totaled 2.4 billion euros ($2.67 billion) for the third quarter, up 11% compared with a year earlier after adjusting for exchange rates, said Gucci's corporate parent, Kering SA, on Thursday.
That was Gucci's lowest growth rate since the second quarter of 2016, before the company enjoyed a stunning run of growth as it became one of the hottest brands in fashion.
Analysts were expecting sales to rise 8%.
Gucci's sales in North America fell 2%, after a 2% decline the previous quarter.
The region has been one of the brand's weakest since the blackface scandal erupted in February.
Critics said a black Gucci sweater that covered the lower part of the face with a cutout for the mouth surrounded by bright red lips resembled blackface.
Gucci apologized, but the backlash on social media against the brand from prominent African-Americans, who have been some of the company's most ardent fans, appeared to hurt its cachet.
To restore growth in the U.S., Jean-Marc Duplaix, Kering's chief financial officer, said the brand is rolling out new marketing activities, such as window displays on the ground floor of Saks Fifth Avenue in New York and store events ""to promote personalized engagement around newness.""
Those activities, which began in September, are too recent to have an impact on the quarter's results, he said.
Since appointing Alessandro Michele as creative director in 2015, Gucci has been on a tear.
Sales have more than doubled, hitting 8.3 billion euros last year.
It is now the third largest luxury brand by revenue after Louis Vuitton and Chanel.
Mr. Michele's eclectic designs, which mix sports-team logos and antique references, have won the brand a wide following, from hip-hop-savvy Americans to Chinese millennials.
For several years, Gucci generated more buzz on social media than any other luxury brand -- until the blackface scandal led Gucci to pull back its marketing activities and let time heal some of the damage to its image.
""It should rather bear fruits in the coming months,"" Mr. Duplaix said.
Sales in Hong Kong, a major destination for luxury shopping, fell 35% in the quarter, but Kering was able to make up some of the lost sales in other markets.
In particular, well-heeled Chinese, who are among the main shoppers in Hong Kong, spent more at home in mainland China or in other overseas markets such as Europe or Japan.
Kering, which also owns Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga, said that overall revenue increased 12% to 3.9 billion euros.

"World News: Hong Kong Clashes Escalate, Raise Alarm --- Anger at police, erosion of city's autonomy draw thousands of people into the streets","HONG KONG -- Police and demonstrators clashed in Hong Kong this weekend in some of the fiercest confrontations to rock the semiautonomous Chinese city, fueling apprehension that a summer of protests against the encroachment of Beijing is veering into dangerous new territory.
Late Sunday, a normally bustling commercial district was fogged over in tear gas as police with shields and gas masks fought to contain thousands of protesters, many clad in black and wearing yellow hard hats.
The day before, similar clashes unfolded in an outlying district of Hong Kong where a week earlier a group of thugs with sticks and rods beat up subway passengers, some of whom were returning from a mass march that day.
The sustained clashes at opposite ends of the territory marked the first time since protests began in June that such intense confrontations took place on back-to-back days. Adding to a sense of disorder, the demonstrations gained momentum even as police resorted to more aggressive tactics to tamp them down. That included making more arrests, deploying more tear gas, charging with riot sticks and firing nonlethal projectiles into crowds now adept at erecting barricades from dismantled fencing. Hong Kong police announced Monday that they had made at least 49 arrests Sunday.
Meanwhile, Hong Kong demonstrators are now experimenting with more dangerous tactics like setting small fires in occupied roadways.
""For Hong Kong this is very serious, among the worst we have seen,"" said Kin-ming Liu, a longtime Hong Kong journalist and opinion writer. ""It looks very bad and I honestly don't know how it will play out.""
Compounding the apprehension gripping this city is the widespread perception that its Beijing-backed leadership is unable to provide a political resolution to the unrest, which began two months ago in opposition to a planned law that would make it easier for Beijing to extradite Hong Kong residents for trial in mainland China.
With hundreds of thousands of marchers on the streets in June, the city's Chief Executive Carrie Lam put the controversial extradition law on hold. But demonstrators, who want it scrapped entirely, were unsatisfied with what they saw as a half measure.
In the weeks since, the intensity of the protests has grown, adding to calls for Mrs. Lam to resign. Mrs. Lam has called for an end to the violence and has said she has no plans to step down.
The embattled leader, who hadn't been seen in public since last Monday, attended the graduation ceremony of the Military Summer Camp for Hong Kong Youth on Sunday, according to a government press release.
""Young people are the driving force of the development of Hong Kong,"" Mrs. Lam said in the speech, while thanking the Hong Kong garrison of China's People's Liberation Army for its support of the camp.
The Chinese central government's office responsible for Hong Kong and Macau said it would hold a news conference Monday to address the protests, which have stretched into their eighth weekend.
Companies also appear to be suffering. In a survey published Monday in Asia, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong found that more international businesses are feeling pessimistic about short-term prospects for the territory. Respondents cited increased violence and political brinkmanship as catalysts fueling the perception that Hong Kong is a riskier place to do business. The survey, which polled sectors in financial services, logistics and technology, found disrupted supply chains and consumption have caused a short-term hit to some companies' revenue.
The protesters' rallying cries have become broader -- including chants for a freer Hong Kong after Beijing chipped away at the rights and freedoms cherished by local citizens, making potential resolution more elusive. The city's government has in the past few years outlawed a political party that advocated independence, ousted legislators, and prosecutedopposition activists.
Ray Chan, 28 years old, said the local government's inability to find a resolution spurred him to take to the streets on Sunday night in Hong Kong. ""We're out here trying to force the action,"" he said.
Nearby, tear gas wafted in the air as a mix of protesters, residents and tourists huddled in doorways and scrambled along a major thoroughfare, seeking safety. Some ran into a subway station to avoid the chaos, others held their shirts to their mouths against the gas.
Tango Chou, a 24-year-old from Switzerland who arrived in Hong Kong Monday morning for vacation, said he was shocked that a protest ""can escalate so quickly in a place where you'd think you'd have a level of safety, security and trust between the people and the police,"" he said.
Police later charged with batons, clubbing and detaining a number of protesters.
Vesley Ho, 20, said the use of force won't stop him and his friends from standing up for Hong Kong. ""It's just getting worse,"" he said. ""All we can do is defend ourselves, against the government, against the police.""
The demonstrations that began in June took a particularly violent turn last week when up to a hundred men wielding metal and wooden rods set upon passengers in a subway station in the Yuen Long district, injuring dozens. Their targets appeared to be protesters returning from a march, but everyday passengers, including a pregnant woman, were severely beaten.
Critics have accused pro-Beijing politicians of enlisting the thugs from among Hong Kong's centuries-old ""Triad"" mafia underworld in an act of desperation. These accusations gained credence after police arrested men with suspected gang links.
""What's happening is the Triad gangsters are acting as a second-tier law enforcement for the government to try to suppress the protests and spread fear in Hong Kong,"" said Nathan Law, an influential pro-democracy activist.
One sign of the anxiety in Hong Kong is that locals are openly discussing whether People's Liberation Army soldiers garrisoned in Hong Kong could be called out to restore order.
In recent days, Chinese officials have issued reminders that the Chinese military could legally be called upon by Hong Kong's leadership. While analysts say it is extremely unlikely unless street clashes deteriorate significantly, the statements have added to local unease.

Beijing Meddles With Hong Kong at Own Peril --- Extradition issue could jeopardize profitable setup,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Hong Kong could pay a big price for taking even a small step closer to Beijing.
The semiautonomous territory's largest protest march since its handover to China in 1997 -- more than a million people flocked to the streets on Sunday, according to organizers -- has yet to sway its government from pressing ahead with a law that would allow citizens to be extradited to mainland China. Leaders indicated Monday that debates on the legislation, which will allow Beijing to take people across the border to stand trial in the mainland, would continue in the city's legislature on Wednesday. Further protests are expected.
The government has argued it is merely plugging a loophole in its laws, which currently don't allow extradition between Hong Kong and mainland China. But this firewall is precisely what has made the ""One Country, Two Systems"" approach, under which Hong Kong keeps a separate legal system and independent judiciary, workable. Muddying the water between the two jurisdictions will cast doubts on Beijing's commitment to the arrangement.
There may not be drastic overnight changes to Hong Kong's civil liberties, but the mere possibility that residents or visitors could be extradited to the mainland's opaque judicial system is likely to haunt investors and business folk in the city.
In reality, they already have reasons to worry. There are plenty of examples of Beijing ignoring Hong Kong's rule of law when it sees fit. A Hong Kong bookseller was apparently seized by Chinese agents in the city and taken to the mainland in 2015. A Chinese billionaire disappeared in the city two years later. The Hong Kong government, which is accountable to the Chinese government, hasn't showed itself to be capable of standing up to Beijing in these instances. There is no reason to believe it will do so now.
A U.S. State Department spokeswoman said Monday that the proposed law could affect the special status of Hong Kong, which enjoys distinct treatment from the rest of China under the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. Removing its special status is unlikely, as this could hurt the interests of many American companies in the city. But the gradual erosion of Hong Kong's independent rule of law could one day make the move inevitable.
As its official status as a ""special administrative region"" makes clear, Hong Kong owes its success under Chinese rule to a finely balanced legal compromise -- one backed by more than two decades of history. Beijing meddles with a highly profitable formula at its own cost.

"World News: Trump Rejects Globalism in U.N. Speech --- President articulates America First outlook, urges other nations to favor their own citizens","UNITED NATIONS -- President Trump called on other countries to respect American sovereignty and recognize the right of the U.S. to protect itself from threats ranging from challenges to its safety and security to unfair trade practices by China and others.
In an address Tuesday at the United Nations, Mr. Trump articulated the America First outlook that he has used to define his presidency, urging other countries to place priority on their own citizens to ensure global peace and prosperity.
""The future does not belong to globalists,"" he said. ""The future belongs to patriots.""
Mr. Trump endorsed free and fair trade even as he defended his hawkish use of tariffs as a way to get countries around the world -- including some close allies -- to comply with his demands.
He assured the U.N. General Assembly meeting that the use of force was his last resort and pointed to efforts to engage with countries such as North Korea and Iran that have long been at odds with the U.S.
""Many of America's greatest friends today were once its greatest foes,"" he said. ""The United States does not seek conflict with any other nation. We desire peace, cooperation, and mutual gain with all. But I will never fail to defend America's interests.""
The speech came as Mr. Trump confronts several foreign-policy challenges, including a thorny trade dispute with China and an escalating dispute with Iran.
A longtime critic of global alliances, Mr. Trump at the U.N. this year is seeking to build a new global coalition of countries to negotiate a new agreement with Iran that goes beyond nuclear matters.
He has avoided intervening with military action following an attack on Saudi Arabia's oil industry earlier this month. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran for that attack. France, Germany and the U.K. on Monday joined the U.S. in blaming Iran.
""All nations have a duty to act,"" he said. ""As long as Iran's menacing behavior continues, sanctions will not be lifted. They will be tightened.""
Mr. Trump's remarks on China were among his strongest to date. He called on Beijing to ""honor its binding treaty to protect Hong Kong's freedom, legal system and democratic ways of life,"" following months of pro-democracy protests that have frequently led to violent clashes.
On the economic front, he said China had abused its membership in the World Trade Organization by using it to carry out an unfair trade agenda. He defended his trade war with China, calling upon the global community to band together to pressure China to adopt fair and reciprocal trade practices.
China ""has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping, forced technology transfers and the theft of intellectual property, and also trade secrets, on a grand scale,"" he said. ""For years these abuses were tolerated, ignored or even encouraged.""
He expressed optimism that trade talks with China would ""restore balance"" in the relationship.
Mr. Trump spoke at length about border security, a divisive domestic issue that he framed Tuesday as an important global question. He hailed Mexico for its efforts to stem migration flows to the U.S. and pointed to the need for economic development in many Central American countries to create incentives for people to stay home.
""These nations cannot reach their potential if a generation of youth abandon their homes in search of a life elsewhere,"" he said.
He also offered his support for the people of Venezuela living under the rule of President Nicolas Maduro, whom he described as a ""Cuban puppet."" He cited the country's deterioration as evidence of the dangers of socialism and communism.
The 35-minute speech covered a broad range of topics. The president called upon nations to stop criminalizing homosexuality and called on leaders to better screen foreign technology and investments and to protect data and security.
He also blasted the growing power of social-media platforms, and excoriated media and academic institutions that he said ""push flat-out assaults on our histories, traditions and values.""
""A free society cannot allow social media giants to silence the voices of the people and a free people must never, ever be enlisted in the cause of silencing, coercing, canceling or blacklisting their own neighbors,"" he said.
The president also held a number of meetings with world leaders. He met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi following his speech. Mr. Trump said he expected a new trade deal with India ""very soon.""
The two countries are seeking a miniature deal that would likely restore India's eligibility for a tariff-discount program that the Trump administration pushed New Delhi out of earlier this year. In exchange, India is expected to open up its markets to more American exports, such as agricultural products.

Hong Kong Politics Test Business,"Businesses, from global titan Nike Inc. to a local bakery, are finding that taking sides or even appearing to do so in Hong Kong protests against Beijing's growing reach can cut both ways for their fortunes.
Companies in China halted sales of a new Nike sneaker after its designer expressed support on social media for the biggest rallies in Hong Kong's history. A cake maker in Hong Kong, meanwhile, reported a big bump in sales when she began making protest-themed pastry to boost the morale of ralliers.
""It was just for fun, and I want to make them happy,"" said Naomi Suen, who runs the Wah Yee Tang bakery.
As Hong Kong residents take to the streets by the millions to protest legislation that would have allowed extradition to China along with other grievances, some companies have had to quickly recalibrate marketing decisions.
At the rallies, protesters often brandish Pocari Sweat, an energy drink from Japan. The company that makes the drink, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., earned favor with them after pulling its ads from Television Broadcasts Ltd., the dominant Hong Kong broadcaster, which protesters accuse of being pro-Beijing.
A Hong Kong-based social-media post by the drink's maker hinted at the time at sympathies for the protests. But Otsuka's corporate headquarters in Tokyo hastened to disagree. ""The decision to withdraw commercials from TVB was made based on marketing strategy and wasn't aimed at sending any political message,"" a company spokeswoman said in a phone interview.
In mainland China, some social-media users called for a boycott of the Japanese drink. In Hong Kong, protesters continue to provide Pocari free marketing, in one case by making the drink the unofficial mascot of a nighttime mass run to show support for the movement.
Otsuka's predicament is similar to the quandary Nike found itself in weeks earlier. Nike's Japanese partner, Undercover, provoked an outcry on Chinese social media after posting a photo of Hong Kong protesters -- since deleted -- with the words ""no extradition to China."" Undercover and Nike were poised at the time to launch a new sneaker in markets including China.
Days later, Chinese retailers including sportswear giant Pou Sheng International Ltd., which owns China's popular YYSports brand, said on social media that they received an ""urgent notice"" from Nike to halt sales of the Undercover sneakers. Nike and YYSports didn't respond to requests for comment.
Nike has also been embroiled in political disputes in the U.S. The company recently withdrew a line of shoes featuring an early version of the American flag after NFL star-turned-activist Colin Kaepernick objected to the design.
China has a range of sensitivities that global businesses must learn to negotiate if they want to succeed in world's second largest economy. Last year, U.S. hotel giant Marriott International Inc. had to briefly shut its website in China after circulating an online guest survey that listed Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet and Macau -- all claimed by China -- as separate countries. Marriott said it was a mistake.

World News: U.S. Tells Travelers To Exercise Caution,"The U.S. raised the level of its advisory for citizens traveling to Hong Kong, asking them to exercise increased caution and citing protests that have already bitten into tourism.
The U.S. moved its advisory to the second-lowest level, which it also maintains for mainland China, citing legal issues there.
The State Department said in a travel notice that some protests have turned confrontational or resulted in clashes. ""The protests and confrontations have spilled over into neighborhoods other than those where the police have permitted marches or rallies,"" it said.
A spokesman for the city's government said, ""Hong Kong remains a welcoming city for tourists and travelers from around the world.""
The U.S. is among 22 countries that have issued travel advisories for Hong Kong, said Edward Yau, the city's economic-development secretary.
Others include Australia, Ireland, Japan and the U.K. Tourism arrivals to Hong Kong were down 31% in early August compared with a year earlier, Mr. Yau said.
In recent weeks, the protests have become more frequent and unpredictable. Schedules discerned from protest chat groups are circulated among ordinary residents so that they know how to plan travel around protest sites.
Tourism-reliant businesses are worried, though. Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., the territory's flag carrier, said in its first-half earnings report that the protests reduced inbound passenger traffic in July and have hurt bookings.
Saudi tourist Najla Aziz's first impression of Hong Kong was a black-clad crowd marching on Saturday in Tsim Sha Shui, a shopping and nightlife district. Because of a blocked road, she had to walk a few blocks with her luggage, as her taxi driver couldn't get to the hotel's doorstep.

World News: Hong Kong Activists Press Police on Subway Attack,"HONG KONG -- Thousands of protesters gathered outside a subway station Friday evening where police beat people inside a train carriage last weekend, the first significant demonstration since the city's leader began offering conciliatory measures earlier in the week.
Protesters hurled abuse at police and demanded the release of surveillance footage from the episode on Aug. 31, in which riot police stormed the Prince Edward subway station following a mass demonstration that the police had ruled illegal.
The latest protests signal that concessions from the city's government this week won't fully quell street protests, following months of demonstrations and fierce clashes between protesters and riot officers.
On Wednesday, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced the full withdrawal of a bill -- which would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China for trial -- that sparked the initial protests. Mrs. Lam refused to meet another of the protesters' demands, which now number five, including an independent inquiry into how police have handled the protests. The city's leader said that a continuing investigation into complaints by a pre-existing police investigations body would be adequate.
On Friday evening, demonstrators gathered with trademark umbrellas, a few dozen wearing gas masks and helmets, in front of the subway station in the northern Kowloon area. They faced off with police, who unfurled signs threatening to fire tear gas, in a standoff that has become commonplace at many demonstrations.
Several demanded police release surveillance footage and said there were claims circulating online that some demonstrators had gone missing following the subway-station clashes on Aug. 31. Some had set up a makeshift memorial with flowers and lights near one subway entrance. The government has said there were no deaths.
The city's subway stations have increasingly become battlegrounds during this summer's demonstrations.
Shortly before 9:30 p.m. on Friday, police fired rounds of tear gas canisters to disperse the protesters at the subway station. Dozens of riot police, some followed by police vehicles, then made their way down streets leading from the station, banging shields as they went.
Further protests were planned for the weekend, including one that could again disrupt traffic to the city's airport.

Hong Kong Turmoil Hits City's Titans --- The companies most exposed to the local economy can no longer avoid its political drama,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Young protesters clashed with riot police at Hong Kong's airport Tuesday, causing travelers' delays and cancellations for a second straight day. The city's major companies can't escape the political drama either, finding themselves pinned between their own staff, the protesters and Beijing.
The city's tycoons face a thorny situation: Property is a linchpin of the local economy and demand for it could be hurt if investors are spooked by the protests. The city's economy is lurching toward its first recession since the financial crisis, and retail and tourism are suffering.
To make things worse, the heightened tensions mean companies risk either offending China, which could seriously affect their ability to operate, or Hong Kong staff and customers -- which could damage sales and morale.
The clearest example has been Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. The flag carrier's shares have tumbled more than 7% in just two trading days, hitting a 10-year low.
That isn't only due to current or prospective disruption at the airport. On Friday, China's aviation authority ordered the company to remove all employees involved in the protests from flights to the mainland, prompting Chief Executive Rupert Hogg to send an email staff saying the airline ""must and will comply"" with the authorities in Beijing.
Chinese bank ICBC issued a ""strong sell"" rating for Cathay Pacific Tuesday, saying the protests ""will cause irreversible damage"" to its valuation premium.
Cathay aside, some of the hardest-hit companies in the past two months of protests have been Hong Kong-focused companies with large real-estate businesses in the city, including New World Development Co., MTR Corp., Swire Pacific Ltd. and Wharf REIC Ltd. Both Wharf and Swire malls have been caught up in protests, while Swire also is the largest shareholder in Cathay.
MTR, which runs the city's subway system including the train to the airport, makes much of its money from developing land around and above its stations. Tear gas was fired in the Kwai Fong MTR station over the weekend. The company's shares are down 6.5% so far this week.
Investors have started to draw keen distinctions between these companies and the many Hong Kong-listed stocks that do little business in the city. The Hang Seng China 50, representing mainland Chinese stocks listed in the city, is down 0.3% over the past two days. Its biggest components are Chinese banks and other state-owned behemoths, which aren't much moved by turmoil in Hong Kong.
By contrast, the more domestic Hang Seng HK 35 index -- which is packed with Hong Kong property developers, utilities and local banks -- has dropped by 3.6% in the same period.
Calling a bottom in Hong Kong's political morass would be risky. No solution to the running battles between protesters and police is in sight. At the moment, shares of Hong Kong's domestic companies are pricing in disruption and inconvenience rather than catastrophe. Things look likely to get worse before they get better.

World News: Hong Kong Girds for Additional Clashes,"HONG KONG -- The arrests of Hong Kong activists, including some of the most prominent figures of the pro-democracy movement, and the ban of a mass rally set the stage for a pivotal weekend showdown between protesters and the city's authorities, as the confrontation showed no signs of abating.
In a series of arrests Friday, police rounded up at least eight opposition figures, including Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow, who are among the best-known faces from the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests. The arrests -- combined with the decision to block a peaceful Saturday rally planned by organizers behind the biggest turnouts in three months of protests -- marked some of the most aggressive moves by authorities to clamp down on the pro-democracy movement, and they risk adding momentum as social unrest enters its 13th weekend.
Throughout the summer, the suppression of dissent has invigorated rather than quelled mass opposition against the government. Online messages from protesters suggested many would congregate on Saturday. Any assembly will now be considered illegal and can be met by police clearance operations.
The unrest was initially sparked by widespread objection to a bill that would have allowed extradition of criminal suspects to China. The demonstrations, which have turned into increasingly violent clashes with police in recent weeks, have broadened into the biggest political turmoil to hit the city since the former British colony was returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Mr. Wong and Ms. Chow, who are both 22 years old and prominent members of the youth political group Demosisto, were released on bail by a court after being charged with offenses related to unlawful assembly for their roles in a June 21 demonstration outside police headquarters.
""We will continue our fight no matter how they arrest and prosecute us,"" Mr. Wong said outside the courtroom. ""We shall not surrender.""
On Friday morning, an appeals tribunal upheld the police ban on a mass rally planned by the Civil Human Rights Front, which has organized three marches this summer that drew between one million and two million people, according to its estimates. Organizers had planned to rally in the city's central business district and head toward the Chinese government's liaison office, a sensitive symbol of China's presence in Hong Kong where protesters in July defaced the national emblem with paint.
Police said they were blocking the march because of concerns about violence after protesters threw Molotov cocktails and set fires in recent weeks, but the ban went further than previous restrictions. Police had prohibited a march organized by the group on Aug. 18 but allowed a rally to go forward. The group estimated 1.7 million showed up for the rally, and the march went forward despite the ban, blocking roads on the way to Hong Kong government headquarters.
Saturday's event was officially canceled, but users on a messaging app popular among protesters, said they would gather even though any assembly would be unlawful.
On Thursday, China's military brought fresh troops into the People's Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong as a part of a regular rotation, according to government-run Xinhua News Agency. The army has done similar rotations since 1998, the year after the city was returned to Chinese rule. State media reports have often noted that the size of the garrison remained unchanged, but reports this week didn't include mention of whether there had been any changes in the number of troops stationed there -- estimated to be between 6,000 and 10,000.
Other opposition activists arrested on Friday included Andy Chan, founder of the banned pro-independence Hong Kong National Party, who was detained at the airport late Thursday on allegations of rioting. Also arrested were lawmakers Au Nok-hin and Jeremy Tam, who have frequently been on the front lines of this summer's protests mediating between more radical protesters and police.
""The Hong Kong activists were apparently arrested for supporting freedoms of assembly and expression -- which are rights, not crimes,"" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. ""These are authoritarian tactics that the Chinese government has long deployed in the mainland, but they didn't used to happen in Hong Kong.""
A senior police official rejected the notion that the arrests were part of a coordinated sweep of movement leaders. He described the arrests as part of the natural course of investigations under way since the protests began.

EXCHANGE --- On Business: Corporate Diplomacy: A Primer,"Executives are under pressure to speak up on social issues they once avoided -- like LGBTQ rights or climate change -- because employees, customers and investors have begun to demand it.
The decision by Dick's Sporting Goods Inc.'s CEO Ed Stack to pull assault-style weapons from shelves last year in the wake of mass shootings is held up as putting principles over profit. Rights advocates commended PayPal Holding Inc. CEO Dan Schulman's cancellation of a North Carolina headquarters during the battle over the state's transgender-bathroom law.
But basketball executive Daryl Morey's recent social-media post supporting Hong Kong's pro-democracy demonstrators shows the potential costs of a corporate conscience.
The trouble began moments after Mr. Morey, the Houston Rockets' general manager, hit the ""tweet"" button. Chinese fans, sponsors, broadcasters and lawmakers viewed a National Basketball Association executive's support of the Hong Kong protests as an assault on their sovereignty.
Mr. Morey deleted the offending tweet, and subsequently tweeted that he hadn't meant to be offensive. But the damage was done.
China's 300 million basketball fans are a highly valuable NBA assets. Chinese broadcasters, sponsors and team owners have joined the NBA family in recent years.
It's fair to ask how an acclaimed GM like Mr. Morey could step into the hornet's nest that everyone doing business in China knows the Hong Kong protests to be. It's equally fair to ask why the NBA lacked a clear playbook for engaging with China.
""When you wade into these politically sensitive topics, particularly in an environment you don't understand, you're inviting a firestorm,"" said Witold Henisz, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School told me this week.
Mr. Henisz, author of a book titled ""Corporate Diplomacy,"" says firms can lose hundreds of millions of dollars in market cap, revenue, legal damages or profit due to political missteps. Projects needing foreign government approval, local community support or consumer acceptance can be derailed by the slightest miscalculation.
Political complexities can be most pronounced in international markets. McDonald's Corp. spent years and millions of dollars unsuccessfully navigating a labyrinth of Soviet bureaucracy and communist sensitivities before winning approval to open its first restaurant in Moscow in 1988.
PepsiCo Inc. beat McDonald's (and rival Coca-Cola Co.) to the Soviet Union by mastering corporate diplomacy. It made considerable inroads after an executive convinced Richard Nixon to hand a can of Pepsi to Nikita Khruschev, the Soviet leader, during a 1959 photo op. The company risked a backlash back home amid a frenzy of anticommunist sentiment, but winning Mr. Khruschev's heart proved a bet worth making.
In China, the house rules are particularly daunting. Executives have complained for years that to grow and have access to 1.4 billion Chinese, they need to put up with local partners stealing intellectual property. Companies have also had to practice self-censorship.
Last year, Marriott International Inc. fired Roy Jones, a 49-year-old social-media specialist, for liking a tweet from a Tibetan separatist group that the Chinese would find offensive. At least a dozen Western brands, including Inditex SA's Zara apparel chain, Daimler AG and Delta Air Lines Inc., have drawn Beijing's ire for similar mistakes.
Tech companies have had to make tough decisions when confronted with China's censorship laws. In 2014, when business-networking site LinkedIn blanked out posts related to the 25th anniversary of the government's deadly crackdown on Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests, rights groups criticized it for going too far to please Beijing.
Mr. Henisz said it's typical for organizations to take measures to not be seen as critical of cultures where they aim to make money.
But this is getting harder in an era where everyone has a video camera in their pocket linked to a global social-media megaphone, he said. It's also tougher when everyone is looking to catch companies being hypocritical or insensitive.

Eye Patch Becomes A Symbol Of Freedom,"Hong Kong -- Disturbing images flickered across a tall white barrier outside Hong Kong's Police Headquarters Monday night. A man whose face was covered by a mask projected video recordings of the previous night's confrontations between police and demonstrators, which left more than 50 hospitalized. Nearby, other protesters led chants accusing law enforcement of lawless behavior. Sunday's police brutality had left them disgusted but not deterred, and one of the most gruesome injuries proved the most galvanizing.
It happened in the Tsim Sha Tsui district. Now-viral photos show a young woman bleeding profusely from her right eye. Protesters say police fired either a beanbag or rubber bullet that penetrated the woman's safety goggles when it smashed into her head. Officials insist there's no evidence cops were responsible. Queen Elizabeth Hospital, where she's being treated, won't relay interview requests to patients. But the South China Morning Post reported that she may lose her eyeball, which was ruptured. On the LIHKG online forum, someone claiming to be her sister said the woman had suffered many broken facial bones and would likely be disfigured.
Her injury shocked Hong Kongers, who aren't naive about police brutality. Since protests began two months ago, police have fired more than 1,800 rounds of tear gas and 160 rubber bullets at pro-democracy demonstrators. Protesters responded to this escalating violence with escalating demands. In addition to full withdrawal of a bill allowing extradition to the mainland and the resignation of Chief Executive Carrie Lam, they now want an investigation into police brutality, the release and exoneration of hundreds who have been arrested during the protests, official clarification that demonstrators weren't ""rioting,"" and direct election of the chief executive and lawmakers.
Protesters say Sunday's police violence was unprecedented. That night I traveled with protesters to the Kwai Fong metro station, where some 100 had gathered to plan a march to the nearby police station. Soon after I left, police fired tear gas inside the metro station, the first time they'd deployed it indoors. Video shows police beating protesters as they tried to board an escalator at another metro station and firing pepper balls from a close range, ""almost execution style,"" Hong Kong legislator Dennis Kwok told me Monday afternoon.
Police likely hoped their use of force Sunday would intimidate protesters into staying home this week, but it had the opposite effect. Thousands protested at the Hong Kong International Airport Monday. Many wore eye patches, held pictures of the injured woman, and chanted ""an eye for an eye."" The airport authority was forced to cancel more than 130 flights as it shut down outbound travel.
Also on Monday more than 200 medical workers held a brief strike, and many of them donned eye patches, too. Outside police headquarters that night, protesters taped posters to the large blue and white barricades. One demanded: ""Bring the Brutes to Justice. Bring Freedom to Hong Kong."" Another was a simple drawing of a somber-looking young woman with a bloody bandage over her eye.

"Protests Boil Over In Hong Kong --- Demonstrators occupy the city's legislature, breaking windows and defacing the chamber","HONG KONG -- Protesters smashed wall-size windows and stormed the city's legislature on Monday, an unprecedented show of force that ratcheted up the worst social turmoil to rock Hong Kong since it returned to Chinese rule 22 years ago.
The mayhem at the government headquarters, which ended in barrages of police tear gas, capped a day in which 550,000 demonstrators marched peacefully through the streets in scorching summer heat, according to organizer estimates.
It was the third mass demonstration in under a month triggered by fears of Beijing's growing influence over the city. A movement that had until now largely stuck to nonviolent means lurched toward anarchy among some of its members.
As mostly young activists broke the windows and defaced the legislative chamber, they described their rampage as a last-ditch effort to force the government to accede in a standoff over the city's future.
The unrest spiraled after Hong Kong's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, sought to pass legislation -- since put on hold -- that would allow suspects to be extradited to China, which has a far more opaque legal system.
The demonstrators have demanded that Mrs. Lam scrap the extradition proposal completely, launch an inquiry into police use of tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse an earlier protest, and resign her office.
A few opposition lawmakers tried unsuccessfully Monday to dissuade the more-aggressive activists from their assault on the legislative building.
Analysts warned that the protesters' approach risked direct intervention from Beijing, which has largely tried to distance itself from the monthlong political turbulence.
""I think it puts Hong Kong in a very dangerous position because the Chinese government will ultimately interfere if it needs to,"" said Steven Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.
Asked about the protest, President Trump said in Washington: ""I hope it gets solved. I was with President Xi of China. We had a great talk, a great discussion, we're talking about doing something and we talked about it briefly, but that's very sad.""
After using makeshift battering rams to break into the building, protesters used their umbrellas -- long a symbol of peaceful resistance here -- to smash exit signs and doors. Some hauled in metal barricades as if preparing for a siege, while others rifled through government papers strewn about with abandon.
""I want freedom,"" said Joe, a recent university graduate who gave only his first name. ""I don't know if this will help or hurt the cause,"" he said of the occupation. ""I just followed the others.""
At a 4 a.m. news conference Tuesday, after police in riot gear had dispersed the protesters occupying the legislative building, Mrs. Lam condemned ""the extreme violence"" of the activists and said ""nothing is more important than the rule of law in Hong Kong.""
Mrs. Lam has stayed largely out of public sight since she suspended the extradition bill June 15, after as many as a million people marched against it and police had used tear gas to disperse a smaller, more hostile protest.
In a speech Monday before the legislature was stormed, Mrs. Lam vowed conciliation and said she would ""actively reach out to young people of different backgrounds.""
Protest leaders weren't mollified. ""She has not shown any sincerity to respond or to communicate so far,"" the Civil Human Rights Front, which organized the three mass rallies, said in a statement.
Early Monday afternoon, swarms of mostly young activists dressed in black and sporting goggles and masks gathered at the government headquarters. They stacked barricades and poles onto a cart, and used it to ram into the building's windows.
Pro-democracy lawmakers raced to the front lines to try to stop them.
""I don't want to see the dire consequences if they crashed their way in, not just to themselves but to all protesters who could be labeled as rioters,"" said Wu Chi-wai, chairman of the city's Democratic Party. ""But they don't want us to stop them.""
By evening, the protesters had battered through. Hundreds streamed into the legislature, spray-painting the walls with messages calling the government a disgrace.
The actions at government headquarters left some in doubt about their common cause. ""The peaceful approach, maybe it's not working, but it's better than using violence,"" said Elvis Ng, a 25-year-old who participated in the march. ""We should not give the government excuses.""
Others said that the nonviolent approach had gotten the protesters to a dead end, and more decisive action -- like the storming of the legislature -- was needed to show the government the protesters were serious.
Still, there were few signs this week that the government intended to budge beyond recent concessions, and Mrs. Lam didn't indicate during her Tuesday news conference that she would formally withdraw the extradition bill.

World News: Beijing Chills Hong Kong Dissent,"HONG KONG -- Every June 4 evening, tens of thousands of people light candles in one of the city's landmark public parks to commemorate those killed in the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown and condemn the perpetrators, China's ruling Communist Party.
Hong Kong is the only place on Chinese soil where such massive demonstrations, which feature chants and banners denouncing the central government in Beijing, are tolerated. As demonstrators prepare to mark the 30th anniversary this coming week, one question on people's minds is: For how much longer?
The city has for decades prided itself on a culture of dissent and discourse, but many fear Beijing's increasingly heavy influence is starting to stifle those freedoms.
Shouts of ""Down with the CCP!"" and ""Time for a democratic China!"" have been heard in previous years at the vigil, where speakers have demanded China's ruling party acknowledge the massacre and introduce the democracy that students in Tiananmen demanded.
Some in the city fear proposed new laws along with the increased targeting of opposition voices threatens to curtail free speech at such events.
""For those who have been deeply engaged and committed to the cause, we will never mind suffering,"" said Albert Ho, the chairman of a nonprofit that organizes the vigil, who says he would never be scared to speak out. ""However, the implications for the general public are more gray, and the freedoms we treasure so much in Hong Kong are at risk.""
As part of a handover agreement with China, the former British colony was guaranteed a status quo arrangement until 2047. But China's growing economic and political clout over the city has increased fears about eroding freedoms decades before that deal expires.
Among the legal moves spooking activists is a proposed extradition law that is likely to be passed in coming weeks, despite a backlash that has revived the floundering pro-democracy movement. The law would allow the transfer of suspects to jurisdictions Hong Kong doesn't have agreements with -- including China, which has a more opaque judicial system.
The bill, which the city's leader has said should allow people to be extradited for crimes, has alarmed business groups, diplomats and activists.
Another law on the table would criminalize disrespect of China's national anthem, while the government has promised to one day introduce controversial national-security legislation -- known as Article 23 -- that would make what authorities deem seditious remarks and actions against Beijing a crime.
Hong Kong's security bureau said the extradition amendment targets fugitives who have committed serious crimes, and that none of these offenses relates to the acts of assembly, press, speech or publication.
It said those freedoms and rights are safeguarded by Hong Kong's laws and its mini-constitution, which the government is determined to protect.
But protesters argue Beijing could use trumped-up charges to target people whose politics offend the government, as has happened in the past. In recent years, Hong Kong booksellers have disappeared, only to emerge in police custody in the mainland.
Protests have continued frequently since a 79-day demonstration in 2014 by the so-called Umbrella Movement that paralyzed the city's main roads. And Hong Kong remains a haven where citizens feel free to criticize the city's leaders and Beijing leaders.
Still, there are indications that press freedoms are being squeezed. Authorities effectively expelled a British journalist from the city after he hosted a press-club talk by a local pro-democracy activist.
Memes and videos of the massacre and the recent extradition proposals flourish on social media like Facebook and Instagram, which are blocked on the mainland but used commonly in Hong Kong.
Attendance at the candlelight vigil has waxed and waned over the years, but this week's vigil is expected to be one of the biggest because the proposed extradition law has reminded people of reasons for resistance, said Suzanne Pepper, a political academic at Chinese University of Hong Kong.
The Tiananmen massacre resonates strongly with some old-guard leaders of Hong Kong's democracy movement. Many of the vigil's organizers were mobilized as lifelong activists after troops gunned down students in Beijing on the orders of China's leaders.
A week before the crackdown, 1.5 million people poured on to Hong Kong's streets in solidarity with the students on the mainland; later, the city became a gateway through which fleeing Chinese protesters were smuggled to the safety of asylum abroad.

EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: Hong Kong's Currency Is Still Rock Solid --- A system put in place in 1983 should once again weather the turmoil the city is facing,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
When the future of Hong Kong was hanging in the balance during Sino-British handover talks, the city's currency lost around a third of its value against the dollar in just 12 months. The Hong Kong government then decided in 1983 to peg its currency to the dollar to restore confidence. The exchange-rate system put in place then should once again weather the turmoil the city is facing.
Could the protests that have embroiled Hong Kong for more than 100 days bring down the 36-year peg? The worries are understandable: Fixed-exchange-rate regimes fail all the time.
But Hong Kong's currency-board system is far more robust than an ordinary peg. Every single Hong Kong dollar in circulation is fully backed by liquid dollar-denominated foreign reserves. In fact, Hong Kong's $433 billion of foreign reserves is more than twice its monetary base, which also includes excess reserves in the banking system and short-term bills issued by the city's de facto central bank.
Unlike many governments with failed pegs, Hong Kong has been very disciplined in sticking to its rules: It cannot create unbacked money, and has to allow its monetary base to fluctuate with capital flows. Hong Kong's money supply growth has largely been in line with the growth of its foreign reserves.
Even against a broader measure of money supply, Hong Kong's reserves still look ample: Reserves stand at nearly half of Hong Kong's local-currency M3, which includes all the Hong Kong dollar deposits in the city. It would take an unprecedented exodus of capital to push the reserves to dangerous levels.
The drawback of the peg is that it can create booms and busts in local asset prices as Hong Kong has essentially handed over its monetary policy making to the Federal Reserve. The city's famously expensive property market is at least partly attributable to the currency arrangement, as local authorities can't tighten monetary policy on their own to rein in asset bubbles.
On the other hand, when capital flows out of Hong Kong the currency-board arrangement means interest rates should automatically rise, which may in turn drive property or stock prices much lower. This was the cost of defending the peg during the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98.
But these costs must be weighed against the benefits. Having such a dependably stable currency has vastly helped Hong Kong in its role as an intermediary between China and the rest of the world, first as a trading port and more recently as a financial center. Abandoning the peg now, just as other questions swirl over the city's future, would put all this at risk. That is why it won't happen for the foreseeable future.

Cargo Weighs on Aviation --- Weakness in international trade is hurting airlines and plane manufacturers,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
For all the fears of a global economic slowdown, putting people on a plane is still a moneymaking proposition. But putting goods on a plane might not be.
Demand for global airfreight dropped 3.3% in the year through August, the International Air Transport Association said last week. Global airfreight volumes have been falling for 10 consecutive months year over year, the longest losing streak since the 2008 financial crisis. China's structural economic slowdown and its tariff spat with the U.S. are the likely culprits.
With few signs of a rebound in the latest manufacturing data, the airfreight industry's weakness is a headwind that airlines and plane makers -- particularly Boeing -- will likely need to keep battling.
Just like in the container-shipping industry, faltering demand hasn't been enough to stop the expansion in freight capacity, which rose 1.9% this year through August. This speaks to a fundamental problem in the air-cargo business: Airlines fly more jets to meet demand from passengers, but this also automatically expands their freight space, depriving them of pricing power. World-wide general cargo yields were down 7.1% over the same period, according to market-data firm WorldACD.
On Friday, Europe's airfreight leader Lufthansa said that unit cargo sales dropped 3.6% in September. A day earlier, Delta Air Lines said that cargo revenue had fallen 17% in the third quarter.
U.S. carriers have so far been harder hit even than Asian ones, despite the disruption at the Hong Kong International Airport caused by recent protests. In the three months through August, North American airlines' U.S. dollar revenue from air-cargo flows between China and the U.S. fell 26% relative to the same period of 2018, compared with 17% for Chinese airlines, WorldACD said. Airlines in other regions lost only 12%.
The impact is particularly visible at U.S. cargo-only airline Atlas Air. Its shares plummeted in August and are now 60% lower than a year ago, compared with a fall of about 10% for Cathay Pacific Airways.
In time, the current surplus of freight space could also hit the manufacturers that make planes specifically designed for freight.
A key example is Boeing's flagship 777 jet, which has long relied on cargo buyers: They made up 33% of orders in 2018 and 65% so far in 2019. The company has said it is leaning on freighter deliveries to fill production gaps in 2020, because faulty General Electric engines are pushing out the production schedule of the new model, the 777X.
Having to cut wide-body production rates in the future would be bad news for both Boeing and its European rival Airbus, which spend a lot of money designing planes and need to build a lot of them to turn a profit. But the Chicago-based manufacturer would be especially affected because it dominates the market for bigger jets, and already has cut production rates on the grounded 737 MAX narrow-body model. Freighter demand from the likes of FedEx and UPS also is keeping its aging 767 in production.
Air cargo isn't usually a make-or-break market for the aviation industry. Right now, though, it is proving to be a very inconvenient ballast.

EXCHANGE --- Markets News: Markets Are Rising Despite Uncertainties,"The world seems more tumultuous than it has in years. Congress is weighing impeachment, the U.K. is on the verge of a momentous vote regarding its role in Europe, and the U.S. and China are still mired in a trade war.
Yet, the S&P 500 is within about 2% of its all-time high. What's going on with Wall Street?
For many money managers, the answer has a lot to do with the Federal Reserve. The central bank has already lowered interest rates twice this year and is widely expected to do so at least once more in 2019.
Bets that the Fed will step in if markets become too volatile or economic data continues to decline are helping many investors shrug off what they say are increasingly dire signals. Their rationale: If interest rates are lower, borrowing costs will drop, potentially giving the economic expansion more room to run even if trade policy and foreign affairs seem murky.
Many investors are also choosing not to try to trade geopolitical events because they say it is hard to quantify how events from the Hong Kong protests to the rise of nationalism in Europe will affect asset prices.
""We may have gotten to a point where investors ignore fundamentals because central banks will always step in with more stimulus and easy money when credit spreads widen or stocks fall,"" said Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.
The S&P 500 closed down just 0.5% on Sept. 27 after a report that the White House was weighing limiting investment in China. It was down 0.8% on Sept. 24 when calls for President Trump's impeachment gained momentum. Oil prices shot higher after an attack on a Saudi Arabian oil facility last month but soon recovered.
Markets also barely budged Wednesday when U.S. retail sales data for September came in weaker than expected -- though investor expectations of a rate cut rose by nearly 15 percentage points on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange that day.
Overall, the S&P 500 has moved an average of 0.8% each day going back to its July high, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The index is up 19% for 2019 but less than 5% from January 2018.
Sandy Villere, portfolio manager at the $2 billion Villere Balanced Fund, said he believes the Fed's support will limit the stock market's declines to around 10%. He's hoarding cash to bargain-hunt during dips. ""When you see those chinks in the armor, you feel the Fed will be there even longer,"" he said.
Investors may have already priced in many geopolitical risks, said Chris Verrone, a partner at Strategas. For instance, last fall's selloff sent the S&P 500 down nearly 20% in less than three months, making the market's double-digit percentage gains in 2019 look like a game of catch-up.
""The market, I think, is saying all this bad news is already priced in,"" Mr. Verrone said.
Meanwhile, many long-term asset managers say they aren't trying to make swift bets on geopolitical events.
Back when the Brexit referendum and U.S. presidential election loomed in 2016, GAM Investments traded options in a bid to benefit from rising market volatility. ""It didn't work,"" said Larry Hatheway, head of investment solutions at the Swiss asset manager. Now, the firm only owns stocks that it thinks will perform well regardless of how or when the U.K. leaves the European Union, he said.

U.S. News: Pompeo Steps Up Beijing Criticism on Australia Visit,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo escalated his criticism of China during a visit to Australia on Sunday, drawing a direct link between what he called one-sided trade deals and China's ability to strengthen its military.
Mr. Pompeo ,speaking in the commercial capital, Sydney, said, ""We were asleep at the switch"" as China began to require technology transfers and launch military exercises in the disputed South China Sea to increase its influence.
""Those are the kind of things that I think everyone needs to have their eyes wide open with respect to,"" Mr. Pompeo said. ""The United States certainly does.""
Australia is Mr. Pompeo's second stop on an eight-day tour aimed at asserting the U.S. role as an Indo-Pacific power.
In Thailand late last week, Mr. Pompeo similarly called out China's economic practices as unfair but didn't name the country until later in his prepared remarks. On Sunday, he appeared to take stronger aim at China during a question-and-answer session on stage at the State Library of New South Wales in downtown Sydney.
""I'll hear folks talk about trade and economic issues as separate from national security,"" Mr. Pompeo said. ""Let's make no mistake about it, China's capacity, the People's Liberation Army's capacity to do exactly what they're doing is a direct result of trade relationships that they built.""
Australia, a staunch American ally that fought with the U.S. in two world wars, faces a difficult diplomatic balancing act with China, which is its biggest two-way trade partner but also poses a growing security threat.
The trade spat between the U.S. and China intensified last week when President Trump threatened to place fresh tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, sparking a threat from China to retaliate. Recent data showed trade tensions have taken a toll, with China no longer the U.S.'s top trading partner.
""We have in the United States [a] deep economic relationship with China, we think there's real opportunity there,"" Mr. Pompeo said. ""But we have to be very, very careful.""
Protests by pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, a former British colony that is now a special administrative region of China, have prompted concerns that China could intervene militarily in the territory. And in the South China Sea, Beijing has enforced its claims to the disputed waters by building artificial islands and equipping them with infrastructure that could be used for military purposes.

Political Economics: What Hong Kong's Protesters Know About Business,"One of the odder tics in discussions of Hong Kong's 10-week political trauma is the notion that the protests rocking the territory are bad for business. Something nearer the opposite is true: These protests are one last chance to preserve the city's economic reputation, at enormous cost -- and risk -- to Hong Kongers, who understand exactly what's at stake.
There is confusion about what this mass popular mobilization means for the economy because the protests are disruptive by design. This week's airport shutdown called attention to a longer-running decline in travel to Hong Kong in recent weeks. Meetings have been canceled, conferences postponed.
How can this be good for a tiny territory whose main business is doing other's people's business -- serving as a hub and conduit for trade and finance across a region? And this isn't the only blow to Hong Kong's reputation. No firm relishes putting its employees in danger simply by asking them to commute to and from work; no one enjoys sending frequent security updates to staff. Growing numbers of companies have to do both in their Hong Kong offices.
This is leading to murmurs about whether Hong Kong remains a viable place to do business. Some leaders in the expat business community warn of ""significant"" damage to the territory's reputation from the upheaval. Another common theme is that when it comes to business attitudes, the protests are as bad as the Chinese intrusions into Hong Kong's legal system that triggered them.
But let's be clear about the real dangers to Hong Kong's economy, because Hong Kongers sure are. It isn't anything so passing as a protest.
What's bad for business in Hong Kong is a form of regulatory capture born not so much of outright corruption as of political inadequacy. One of the territory's most important roles is to serve as a porthole between the mainland Chinese economy and global capital markets. Yet Hong Kong's regulators face notorious difficulties imposing the rule of their law on mainland companies listed on the territory's stock exchange. The danger to Hong Kong's reputation for consistent, business-friendly rules has grown more acute as Chinese President Xi Jinping has tightened his political grip on the state-owned companies listed in Hong Kong.
What's bad for Hong Kong's reputation is the perception that it's a preferred parking place for the wealth of Chinese apparatchiks who have no obvious reason to be wealthy. That includes real estate in the territory worth tens of millions of dollars, allegedly owned at one time or another by relatives or associates of senior Chinese officials, and lucrative business deals between Hong Kong companies and relatives of other senior officials from the mainland.
What's bad for Hong Kong's economy is the extent to which Beijing's preferred method of control to date has been to vest political authority in a relatively small set of professional guilds. Half the members of the territory's legislature are appointed by ""functional constituencies,"" comprised of special-interest groups or trade associations for professions such as law, architecture and insurance -- a method devised to thwart pro-democracy voters. This has fed a creeping corporatism at the expense of Hong Kong's reputation for economic freedom.
Despite these lapses, Hong Kong has more than earned its place at the top of league tables of the world's freest economies. That freedom is sometimes controversial among Hong Kongers, some of whom might prefer a more interventionist social-welfare state funded by higher taxes or tighter regulations of this or that domestic concern. Hong Kongers, however, also understand the importance of relative freedom and rule of law as counterbalances to the indignities Beijing inflicts on them.
This is why so many Hong Kongers see the danger posed by the extradition bill that started this fracas. That proposal, intended to make it easier to ship individuals from Hong Kong into the maw of China's opaque Communist Party ""justice system,"" would gut the rule of law that underpins the territory's prosperity. It would accelerate the barely tolerable, crawling mainland-ization of the territory's economy into a gallop.
Who could reasonably think acquiescence to this would protect Hong Kong's hard-won reputation as a business hub?
Hong Kong's protests could yet turn tragic if Mr. Xi sends in China's tanks despite all the warnings that doing so would hurt both his own global standing and China's economy. But even if they don't ultimately succeed, Hong Kongers have reminded the world of two important facts.
One is that freedom still tugs at the hearts of millions of ordinary people. The other is that despite the convictions of bien-pensant business leaders, China-infatuated authors and populist-fearing politicians, sometimes the crowd really does know better what's in its own economic interest.

U.S. News: Trump Cautions China on Hong Kong Reaction,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump warned Chinese President Xi Jinping against reacting violently to protests in Hong Kong, saying that could threaten a trade deal, speaking hours after administration officials confirmed a new round of talks.
""It would be much harder for me to sign a deal if he did something violent in Hong Kong,"" the president told reporters Sunday evening in New Jersey before boarding a flight back to Washington. ""I'd like to see that worked out in a humanitarian fashion.""
The president's comments came as top advisers sought to put to rest fears that the two countries are on the brink of a prolonged trade war.
Over the weekend, administration officials said they would give Huawei Technologies Co. more time to work with U.S. customers and said the White House was laying the groundwork for a new round of trade talks with Chinese officials in Washington.
Those moves, combined with last Tuesday's delay in tariffs on $156 billion of Chinese goods, suggest an effort by the White House to dial back trade hostilities following a week of market swings. A 10% tariff on another $111 billion of imported goods will go into effect Sept. 1 as planned.
But Mr. Trump's comments indicate he is in no hurry to make a deal that might calm volatile markets and allay fears of a brewing recession. Mr. Trump appeared to back off from reports that the administration would grant a 90-day extension to the license that has allowed Huawei to do some business with the U.S. despite national-security concerns that landed the Chinese telecom company on an export blacklist in May.
""I'm making a decision tomorrow,"" he said. ""Ultimately we don't want to do business with Huawei, for national security reasons.""
Earlier Sunday, White House economic adviser Lawrence Kudlow said granting the company an extension would give American companies doing business with the Chinese telecommunications firm more time to make adjustments.
Mr. Trump declined to say whether he had spoken with Mr. Xi over the weekend and didn't lay out a timeline for when they might speak again. ""I can speak to him any time,"" he said.
Mr. Trump dismissed fears of a recession, pointing to the strong labor market and robust consumer spending.
""We are doing better than any country or even area in the world,"" he said.
Despite the president's optimism, concerns are mounting that a prolonged trade war and slowing global growth could inflict damage on the U.S. economy.
Although retail spending remained strong in July, U.S. consumer sentiment is slipping, falling to a seven-year low in August, according to an index published by the University of Michigan.
The outlook for businesses is more concerning. Corporate profits were down 2.2% in the first quarter versus the previous year and investment fell at a 0.6% annual rate in the second quarter, according to the Commerce Department. Elsewhere in the world, Germany's economy contracted for the second straight quarter and China reported lower than expected figures for factory production, consumption and property investment.
Mr. Trump suggested China was bearing the brunt of the pain from the tariffs, which would compel the country's leaders to strike a deal.
""China is doing very, very poorly,"" he said. ""We're going to end up doing a very good deal and I think China, by the way, needs a deal much more than we do.""

Budweiser's Asia Unit Raises $5 Billion in IPO,"The Asia business of the world's largest brewer raised about $5 billion in its second attempt at a Hong Kong initial public offering, just months after it called off a much bigger share sale.
Anheuser-Busch InBev SA's Asian unit, Budweiser Brewing Co. APAC, priced its IPO at 27 Hong Kong dollars a share (US$3.45), people familiar with the matter said Tuesday. That was at the low end of an indicative price range.
The deal gives Budweiser APAC a market capitalization of more than $45 billion, making it at a stroke one of the world's largest listed brewers, with a market value far in excess of Japan's Asahi Group Holdings Ltd., Denmark's Carlsberg A/S or local rival China Resources Beer (Holdings) Co. The shares start trading Sept. 30.
In mid-July, Budweiser APAC called off an earlier IPO attempt -- with which it sought to raise nearly $10 billion -- because of a lukewarm investor response. It then sold its Australian unit and returned to the market as a smaller and faster-growing company that derives most of its sales from China, South Korea, India and Vietnam.
Its $5 billion share sale still ranks as Hong Kong's largest IPO this year and is the second-largest offering world-wide in 2019 after ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc.'s $8.1 billion debut in New York, according to Dealogic.
AB InBev went ahead with its IPO despite difficult market conditions. As of Monday's close in Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index was down 8% over the past three months as the city reeled from a summer of sometimes violent protests and a trade war.
New share sales in Hong Kong are gradually picking up. On Tuesday, Chinese sportswear retailer Topsports International Holdings Ltd. launched an IPO of as much as $1.2 billion, according to a term sheet seen by The Wall Street Journal. Last week, a Chinese biotechnology company, Shanghai Henlius Biotech Inc., raised $409 million in an IPO that also priced at the bottom of an indicative range.
The Budweiser APAC share sale could enable the Asian business to pursue regional deals and will help parent AB InBev reduce its huge debt pile, which was accumulated through years of aggressive deal making. AB InBev brews one in four of the world's beers and owns hundreds of brands, including Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona.
Unlike its July attempt, Budweiser APAC this time brought in a cornerstone investor, Singaporean sovereign-wealth fund GIC Pte. Ltd., which agreed to buy $1 billion of its shares. High-profile backers are common features in Hong Kong IPOs.
Andrew Zhou, senior investment manager in the asset- management division of Evergrande Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd., said his funds in July subscribed to Budweiser's IPO but decided not to join this time around. He said the stock's valuation looked unappealing, given the business's modest growth outlook and uncertainties stemming from U.S.-China trade friction.
Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Euan McLeish estimated Budweiser APAC has a price-to-earnings multiple of 37.6 times for 2020, slightly less than the valuation of China's biggest brewer, China Resources Beer, whose stock has already had a run higher this year. Budweiser APAC shares are also more expensive than smaller Chinese rival Tsingtao Brewery Co. and their price-to-earnings multiple is nearly double that of parent AB InBev's stock.
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and China International Capital Corp. served as joint global coordinators for the offering.

Hong Kong Protest Clashes Broaden and Intensify,"HONG KONG -- Protest clashes became more violent and widespread and calls for a citywide strike shut down parts of Hong Kong on Monday, escalating a crisis after the city's top official declined to make concessions.
Police and gangs of men wielding bamboo sticks and other weapons engaged in pitched battles with protesters around the city. The protests, unlike most in nearly two months of unrest, started on a weekday morning, an effort by protesters to bring working life in the busy financial hub to a standstill to draw attention to their cause.
Demonstrations on Monday, extending a ninth weekend of unrest, spread to at least 10 neighborhoods. More than 200 flights into and out of the city were canceled throughout the day as workers, including air-traffic control staff, joined the strike. Commuters were stranded by delays to subway services because of protesters blocking train doors.
By late afternoon, police began facing off with thousands of protesters around the city, firing rounds of tear gas. Police said they arrested at least 82 people.
The protests started in June over an extradition bill, since suspended, that would have allowed suspects to be sent to China for trial. Protesters have since become increasingly aggressive and expanded their demands, underpinned by a belief among some that they are fighting to preserve the rights and freedoms enjoyed by people in the semiautonomous Chinese city.
Protesters on Monday revived calls for Carrie Lam, the city's chief executive, toresign.
Some of the protests were nimble, with people moving en masse, leading riot police around the city. Some protesters showed up outside police stations and threw objects at the buildings, in some cases starting fires. Outside the police station in the Sha Tin district, police had to throw buckets of water from the building on a large fire.
Following calls from the Chinese media for people to support police, gangs of men were seen beating up protesters in some districts. The Global Times, a state-run tabloid, circulated a video dated Aug. 5 of people in black shirts getting beaten in a Hong Kong subway station. The video was captioned: ""The Hong Kong people have finally spoken out! The people in black shirts are getting beaten!""
""Restore Hong Kong. The revolution of our time,"" protesters chanted in a demonstration on Monday at a temple in Wong Tai Sin, a working-class neighborhood that was the site of weekend clashes in which enraged residents went into the streets in flip-flops and shorts to drive out police.
Thousands gathered at the protest, overflowing into a nearby mall. Many took shade under umbrellas and held yellow signs reading, ""No extradition to China.""
Some protesters threw umbrellas at police, who then used tear gas to disperse the crowds near the temple.
Speaking in a news conference on Monday in her first public comments in two weeks on the political turmoil, Mrs. Lam condemned the violent protests and said the government would be resolute in maintaining law and order. She didn't give in to any demands, setting the stage for more clashes.
Judy Tseng, 35, who lives in the Wong Tai Sin neighborhood, said she hadn't attended any of the previous rallies in the past nine weeks but that she was so angered by Mrs. Lam's comments that she skipped work to support the citywide strike.
Mrs. Lam is ""full of lies and shameless,"" said Ms. Tseng, who works for an insurance company. ""We are not what she said -- opposing 'one country, two systems.' What we are really against is her incompetent government.""
""One country, two systems"" is the arrangement under which China allows Hong Kong more freedoms than the mainland.
Beijing's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office scheduled a news conference Tuesday to make a statement about the unrest.

Stocks Advance With Focus on Fed,"U.S. stocks edged higher ahead of central-bank policy meetings around the world as investors continue to bet the Federal Reserve will slash interest rates this year.
Investors have ramped up expectations of interest-rate cuts in recent weeks. They will be watching the Fed meeting concluding Wednesday for clues on how central bankers will proceed, which will have wide-ranging implications across stock, bond and currency markets. The Bank of Japan and Bank of England also meet this week.
The slim stock-market advance built on two weeks of gains by major U.S. stock indexes. U.S. stocks rallied in June after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank would act if needed to sustain U.S. economic expansion in the face of escalating geopolitical and trade tensions.
Now, expectations that the Fed could reinforce that message this week helped lift markets, analysts said. Many investors expect the central bank to keep interest rates unchanged this month but cut them later this year, as soon as July, data from CME Group show.
""Investors are thinking that the Fed's going to come out with some dovish language Wednesday,"" said Tracie McMillion, head of global asset allocation at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""That would give markets maybe an additional boost.""
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 48.37 points, or 0.6% to 7845.02. The S&P 500 rose 2.69 points, or 0.1%, to 2889.67. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 22.92 points, or 0.1%, to 26112.53.
Investors turned to companies that offer the prospect of higher growth. Shares of Facebook jumped by $7.68, or 4.2%, to $189.01. Netflix rose by $10.89, or 3.2%, to $350.62. They also bought shares of vegetarian-food company Beyond Meat, sending its stock up $18.48, or 12%, to a high of $169.96.
However, Ms. McMillion said news from central bankers globally could spur volatility in stock markets. Additionally, several analysts warned that the Fed has a difficult task crafting its message to market watchers.
""Our view on U.S. equities is more cautious. We're keeping a close eye on the data, which has been deteriorating,"" said Greg Boutle, U.S. head of equity and derivative strategy at BNP Paribas.
Fresh data showed that a measure of U.S. home-builder confidence slipped in June, a sign of languishing sentiment in an important sector of the economy. Meanwhile, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey's general-business-conditions index registered its largest monthly decline on record. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said 30% of respondents reported business conditions that had worsened from a month earlier.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell for the fifth consecutive day as bond prices rose, the latest indication of how difficult it has been for investors to size up the path of monetary policy and ramifications of trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Investors tend to turn to relatively safer assets like government bonds when stocks are falling. But both stock and bond prices rose in lockstep to start the week, continuing a recent trend. The 10-year yield fell to 2.086% from 2.093% Friday.
Investors have also been watching for signs of how the U.S. trade battle with China will ripple through the domestic economy. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative will be overseeing public hearings this week on the Trump administration's proposal to raise a levy on $300 billion of Chinese exports, including consumer goods such as mobile phones and laptops.
In Europe, investors will focus on the European Central Bank's annual forum in Portugal. While not an official monetary-policy meeting, the ECB has previously used the forum to signal a shift in approach.
At midday Tuesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei Stock Average was down 0.3%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.4% on Monday as authorities indefinitely suspended debating an extradition bill that sparked a wave of protests. Early Tuesday, the benchmark was up a further 0.9%.

"S&P Overcomes Cisco, Kraft Falls","The S&P 500 eked out a gain to close at a record following a tepid trading session.
The broad index rose in the final hour of trading as shares of real-estate companies and material firms notched gains along with communication and consumer-discretionary stocks.
That helped overcome a steep decline in shares of Cisco Systems, which weighed on the stock market throughout Thursday's session and kept the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite in the red.
Analysts blamed the tepid trading session on signs of doubt around the U.S.'s ability to clinch the first part of a trade truce with China this year. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the U.S. and China continue to haggle over agriculture purchases, giving investors little enthusiasm to buy riskier assets broadly.
While stocks were listless throughout most of the session, assets considered to be safe stores of value notched bigger moves. Gold rose 0.6%, while the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell for a third straight day. Prices rise as yields fall.
""Investors need to see something that they're comfortable with on the trade front,"" said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners. Until then, ""It's a 'hold your breath' type of market,"" he added.
Investors will continue to monitor the U.S.-China trade situation, analysts said, as well as economic figures due Friday on retail sales and industrial production.
The S&P 500 rose 2.59 points, or less than 0.1%, to 3096.63. The Dow industrials fell 1.63 points, or less than 0.1%, to 27781.96, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 3.08 points, or less than 0.1%, to 8479.02.
All three indexes were hampered by Cisco's $3.55, or 7.3%, pullback to $44.91, its biggest drawdown in three months, after the company said late Wednesday that it expects to book its first quarterly revenue decline in more than two years. The networking company, considered a proxy for corporate high-tech hardware demand, blamed lighter customer spending for the lackluster outlook.
""We're painfully aware of the situation"" with Cisco, Mr. Bailey said. Despite Cisco's bellwether status, the company's problems appear to be restricted to itself, he added.
Technology stocks in the S&P 500 fell 0.1%, as shares of several other communications- equipment companies declined along with some semiconductor stocks.
Kraft Heinz slid $1.94, or 5.9%, to $30.96 after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the food company.
Real-estate and material stocks rallied 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively, by the session's end, helping the S&P 500 overcome Cisco's weakness. Shares of communication, consumer discretionary and industrial companies also rose, giving the broad index some support.
The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.4%, led by declines in auto makers. Asian stocks were mixed, with the Shanghai Composite up 0.2%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.9% as antigovernment protests snarled the city. Early Friday, Japan's Nikkei was up 0.7%, the Hang Seng was up 0.4% and the Shanghai benchmark was up 0.2%.

Dow Reaches A Record on Boeing News,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a gain in quiet trading, notching its ninth record close of the year.
With the bulk of third-quarter earnings out, investor attention has turned back to the U.S.-China trade talks.
After some optimism around the prospects of a ""phase one"" trade deal last week, analysts like Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, have flagged concerns that investors could be disappointed by the scope of an agreement.
""The fundamental trade tension between the U.S. and China is unlikely to go away in a hurry, and I think the problem with calling it a phase one trade deal is that it then implies there will be a phase two trade deal,"" Mr. Bell said.
The blue-chip average rose 10.25 points, or less than 0.1%, to 27961.49, erasing earlier losses. The S&P 500 fell 6.07 points, or 0.2%, to 3087.01 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 11.04 points, or 0.1%, to 8464.28.
Corporate news drove stock swings. The U.S. bond market was closed in observance of Veterans Day.
T-Mobile shares slipped $1.32, or 1.6%, to $79.62 after The Wall Street Journal reported that WeWork is in talks with the company's chief executive, John Legere, to take over leadership of the office-sharing startup.
Boeing jumped $15.96, or 4.6%, to $366.96 after the aerospace company said it expects to resume deliveries of its 737 MAX next month.
Gains in the stock added more than 100 points to the Dow industrials.
Earlier, Hong Kong's Hang Seng benchmark closed down 2.6%, the fourth-biggest drop of the year, after police fired gunshots at protesters and demonstrations across the city forced schools and offices to close early. Early Tuesday, the benchmark was down 0.3%.
""It's very concerning today,"" said Weiqi Zhu, a fund manager at Gao Zheng Asset Management, adding that political uncertainty was putting off investment in Hong Kong. ""The violence is up to another stage now.""
The continuing protests have set off similar selloffs this year, including in August when demonstrators paralyzed the airport, one of the world's busiest travel hubs.
The Hang Seng Index is one of the weakest major stock-market performers this year, up 4%, compared with double-digit gains elsewhere in Asia, the U.S. and Europe.
In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite fell 1.8% on Monday. Consumer inflation data out over the weekend showed prices soared in October to the highest level in more than seven years, fueled by a continued surge in pork prices. Early in day Tuesday, the index was down 0.5%.
Analysts said the data reduced the chances of further monetary easing in China, at least in the coming months.
The Stoxx Europe 600 fell less than 0.1%. Mining stocks, which are often sensitive to changes in Chinese macroeconomic policy, were among the weaker performers, with Glencore losing 3.5% and BHP down 2%.
In currencies, the British pound rose 0.6% against the dollar after Nigel Farage's Brexit Party said it won't contest Conservative-held seats in the December election. The move could make it easier for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to obtain a majority in the election.

World News: Hong Kong Mask Ban Triggers Clashes --- Government invokes emergency measures to end protests; subway shut down,"HONG KONG -- Street battles raged across Hong Kong and the city's subway operator suspended its entire network late Friday as the government's move to invoke emergency measures and ban people from wearing masks at protests triggered a backlash.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam invoked the British colonial-era law for the first time in 52 years, saying it was a deterrent to social unrest that posed a serious public danger. The ban on people wearing masks at public gatherings and unlawful assemblies would be punishable by as much as one year in prison.
After the law was announced, lawlessness returned in many districts around the city as clashes broke out between police and protesters. Demonstrators set fires outside subway entrances and vandalized Chinese banks, while police fired volleys of tear gas in several areas.
The city's subway operator, MTR Corp., in explaining the shutdown, cited destruction and arson in multiple stations and said some of its staff had been injured.
A 14-year-old boy was shot in the leg by police in the northern district of Yuen Long, local media reported. Police later said an officer who was out of uniform and attacked by protesters fired a gunshot in self-defense in Yuen Long. A spokeswoman said she didn't have any information on whether the shot hit anyone.
Many protesters wore masks at Friday's protests, as they have done during the past four months to avoid being identified, with some also wanting to protect themselves from tear gas fired by riot police amid widespread and violent clashes.
The movement is targeting the city's government and police force as well as Beijing, which protesters say is exerting more influence in the semiautonomous Chinese city.
Just before midnight when the ban was to come into force, a High Court judge rejected an attempt by a pair of pro-democracy activists to delay its imposition, saying the government had the right to impose such rules and citing the backdrop of violence and escalating disorder.
The full emergency law gives the government sweeping powers that include allowing authorities to impose curfews, censor media, and take control of ports and all transport, although the ban on masks was the only measure imposed Friday. Opponents said the use of emergency executive powers bypasses the legislature and could lead to greater restrictions on people's freedoms.
""What she's done is alarming and dangerous -- she's pouring fuel on the fire,"" said Emily Lau, a former chairwoman of the Democratic Party. ""Once you open up Pandora's box, where does it end?""
News of the mask ban spurred street demonstrations at lunchtime Friday. After the announcement, thousands more poured onto streets across the city, many dressed in office or ordinary clothing, chanting ""Hong Kong people, resist!"" A march to oppose the law was called for Saturday afternoon.
""This entire movement started off because of a law Hong Kong people didn't agree with, and now Mrs. Lam is using an even harsher law to answer to those disagreements in society,"" said a civil servant surnamed Lam.
Mrs. Lam has been under increased pressure to contain the protests, which are hammering tourism and retail sales and sending Hong Kong's economy hurtling toward recession. The Hang Seng HK35 index, made up of stocks particularly exposed to the local economy, closed around 1.4% lower.
The chief executive said that even though she was using emergency laws, Hong Kong wasn't in a state of emergency. She said she believed the new measure would create a deterrent effect against masked violent protesters and will assist police with law enforcement.
""We need to save Hong Kong's present and its future,"" said Mrs. Lam. ""Making this decision was not an easy decision. But with the current situation, it was a necessary one.""
Under the law, those who wear masks at public gatherings with more than 50 people and marches with over 30 people face up to 12 months in jail and a fine of more than $3,000. As well, anyone who refuses to take off a mask at the request of police in a public area faces a fine of around $1,300 and up to six months in jail. The regulation applies to masks made of any material -- including paint -- that cover a person's face.
Exceptions would be made for people using masks for professional, religious or health reasons, according to the regulations.
The city's beleaguered police force, along with pro-Beijing groups, had called for officials to use the law so they could better tackle protests.
Mrs. Lam last month pledged to withdraw an unpopular extradition law that triggered mass street protests in early June. The move failed to quell unrest as protesters continued to pursue further demands, including a judge-led independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, pardons for those arrested at rallies and greater democratic freedoms.

World News: Young People Demonstrate Power in Numbers,"A historic demonstration sent what organizers said were nearly two million people pouring into Hong Kong's streets on Sunday.
They came to show their opposition to a proposed law that would extend the reach of China's judiciary into Hong Kong among other demands, capping a week of protests that have convulsed this city of around 7.4 million.
But the masses of black-clad people obscured hundreds of thousands of individual stories. Many who marched Sunday took to the streets for the first time last week and an overwhelming number of them were young. Here are some of their stories.
In 2003, auto trader Chapman Chung followed his mother to his first Hong Kong protest. Last week, he persuaded her to march again, shoulder to shoulder with as many as a million people.
""It's our movement,"" he said. ""It's our time.""
In the past few days, Mr. Chung helped coordinate supplies for the protests on WhatsApp and Telegram. During Sunday's march, he carried a cardboard sign urging people to vote in local elections. After a local legislator withdrew his support for the extradition bill, Mr. Chung said, ""it reminded me we have that power.""
Mr. Chung said he has business in China and some of his friends on the mainland support the extradition bill. He said that to a degree, things have improved in China -- socially, politically and, of course, economically -- but he still worries about his freedoms being curbed.
""If you trust the Chinese government, this amendment is logically sound,"" he said. ""But deep down, we still don't.""
University lecturer Minnie Li was briefly hospitalized after staging a hunger strike for 90 hours last week in protest of the extradition bill.
Ms. Li, who hails from mainland China but is now a Hong Kong permanent resident, said she became disillusioned with the Communist Party after learning the truth about the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Police questioned her parents after she participated in the 2014 pro-democracy protests, a topic that was censored on the mainland.
Of the hundreds of thousands of mainland Chinese living in Hong Kong, Ms. Li was one of a few hundred who stepped out to support the protest publicly, an act that might bring retaliation back in China. She said she wants Hong Kong to see that some new immigrants aren't indifferent to politics.
Tom Fung, a Chinese language and history major, said he has a lot of feelings about the extradition debate.
""I feel lost and helpless about the future of Hong Kong,"" the college student said. ""I used to have wishful thinking about Hong Kong independence. But it is an undeniable fact that independence is impossible because China is firmly in control of Hong Kong's lifeline,"" including its energy and water supplies.
Mr. Fung, whose family members support the government and oppose the anti-extradition protests, recalled how he learned about the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing from his history teacher.
""Are they really real?"" he recalls thinking about those graphic images of tanks rolling over people. He thought they looked like scenes from a horror movie after reading a draft of a book written by his history teacher on the Tiananmen Square incident. ""I can't imagine a time when my children and my grandchildren live in Hong Kong -- they can't use Facebook. They can't speak up. They can't freely express themselves on the internet."" he said. ""They could only live in a haze, and that makes me feel astray.""
Jess Leung said she took to the streets to protest against the extradition bill for one simple reason: ""We can't stay out of the way anymore.""
She came out again on June 16 after she joined the first mass rally a week earlier. She was also at the June 12 clashes where police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators.
The protest on June 9 drew more than one million people, ""but the government still ignores our voices,"" Ms. Leung, a student, said. ""So it is a must to revolt.""
Ms. Leung studies Chinese history but hasn't been able to get a complete picture from her textbooks. That has given her a chance to take a closer look at the issues at stake today. She is worried that ""it would be harder for the younger generation to know what's going on"" in China, she said. ""It's brainwashing education.""
""I don't want Hong Kong to become a lawless place."" Ms. Leung said. She acknowledged that Hong Kong is part of China after the 1997 handover, though she believes it's necessary to keep the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement, which guarantees a high level of autonomy for the city until it expires in 2047. ""Without freedom, there is no difference from being in jail."" she said.

China Needs to Keep Status Quo In Hong Kong --- An intervention by Beijing would risk choking off foreign capital and long-term economic growth,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
""One country, two systems"" -- the awkward formula under which freewheeling Hong Kong has survived in China's statist economy -- has always been viewed with deep ambivalence in the ultra-capitalist territory and Beijing alike. Yet maintaining the arrangement is paramount to the success of both.
Relations between Beijing and the semiautonomous city now face their biggest test since the U.K. handed back the territory in 1997, as protests sparked by legislation that would have permitted extraditions to the mainland mushroom into a wider movement. Many fear that Beijing could ultimately intervene directly.
Still, direct intervention would be hugely risky for Beijing -- not just politically, but also for China's global economic ambitions, financial stability and ability to attract foreign capital and expertise.
On pure size, Hong Kong carries far less heft relative to the mainland than in the late 1990s. Its output was 3% as large as the mainland's in 2018, against nearly one-fifth in 1997.
But the city remains central to China's economy. It is its main interface with global capital markets, the conduit for most foreign direct investment in China and a big source of assets sitting on Chinese banks' and property developers' balance sheets. Sudden disruption to all this would have unpredictable -- perhaps unmanageable -- effects on China's own rickety financial system.
Moreover, China's own reluctance to push forward with reforms has only raised the value of Hong Kong as a buffer between the mainland and global capital markets. Following the Shanghai stock-market crash and Chinese currency crisis of 2015, China has progressively tightened its grip on capital flows into and out of the country. The ""connects"" between Hong Kong financial markets and mainland markets are the easiest pathway for foreign investors to buy Chinese assets, and the offshore yuan market centered in Hong Kong offers Beijing additional ways to discourage currency speculators.
While Hong Kong is legally part of China, the People's Republic guaranteed it a ""high degree of autonomy"" until 2047 as a condition of the 1997 handover. Hong Kong has its own Western-style legal system, currency and trade agreements. The U.S. and other major powers treat it as a separate legal jurisdiction. Should the U.S. reconsider that status, as legislators have threatened in the event of aggressive action by Chinese authorities, Hong Kong could become subject to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, technology-export controls or visa changes.
The hit to Chinese trade would be manageable. But the financial impact of a loss of confidence could be severe. Chinese investment inflows into Hong Kong over the past two decades have been gargantuan. Should capital flight tank the property market -- or undermine the Hong Kong dollar's longtime peg to the greenback -- Chinese property developers and banks would likely sustain serious damage. The impact could be magnified if the yuan simultaneously comes under pressure or international political pressure curtails Chinese companies' ability to refinance dollar debt. Even assuming the immediate financial turbulence could be contained, any change in the status quo would cause severe long-term damage.
Investors like funneling cash into China through Hong Kong because the city's legal and regulatory system -- combined with the substantial Hong Kong footprint of wealthy Chinese and Chinese companies -- means investors have real recourse in the event of disputes. If investors conclude Hong Kong is no longer a reliable base for jumping into China, foreign investment into the nation as a whole may take a substantial, permanent hit. On Friday credit-ratings company Fitch, citing deteriorating international perceptions of governance and the rule of law, downgraded Hong Kong for the first time since 1995.
One reason China bounced back after the trauma of the massacre of student protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989 is that foreign leaders still assumed Beijing was committed to ""reform and opening."" Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping had strong credentials as a reformer, despite his role in the crackdown, and liberalization kicked off again in 1992 with his ""southern tour.""
These days, China carries much greater economic weight but shows little sign of embracing further liberalization. So far, European and other Asian nations haven't presented a united front with the U.S. on trade relations, but a tragedy in Hong Kong might change their calculus.
Hong Kongers have the most to lose if matters deteriorate, but Beijing's dependence on the city runs far deeper than it might appear.

World News: Hong Kong Protesters Defy China Warning --- Police use aggressive tactics as some demonstrators fan out around the city,"HONG KONG -- Police made dozens of arrests late Sunday amid bloody clashes with protesters across the city, cracking down hard on antigovernment demonstrators who defied warnings from Beijing and took to the streets for a 10th consecutive weekend.
In a shift of tactics, police in riot gear charged groups in several districts. In one subway station, they fired tear gas and used batons to beat fleeing protesters, and pinned several to the ground; in another station, squads grabbed protesters from the streets; elsewhere, barrages of tear gas and rubber bullets were fired in a clash outside a police station.
Thousands of angry citizens, many dressed in shorts and flip flops, poured onto the streets of two districts where police made arrests, chanting ""mafia"" at police officers. Some were inflamed after video footage circulating on social media showed police officers had ambushed some demonstrators after posing undercover as protesters. Other videos showed police shooting protesters with rubber bullets from a few feet away.
The few hours of violence came after Beijing officials last week said they strongly supported the actions of Hong Kong police, and asked patriotic citizens in the city to stand up against protesters as well. The city's government warned that the unrest threatened to tip the trading hub into a recession for the first time since the global financial crisis.
On Friday, the city's police force brought back a retired senior officer who had handled street protests in 2014 and 2016 to oversee operations. A day later, hundreds of pro-Beijing figures -- including several business tycoons -- signed an open letter on the front page of the pro-Beijing Ta Kung Pao newspaper supporting the Hong Kong government and police efforts to halt the unrest.
The escalating crackdown is unlikely to calm tensions that have rocked the city, with each previous round of tough tactics bringing widespread public condemnation. While there are growing calls for calm, many in the city of seven million sympathize with protesters. Late Sunday, several hundred residents helped two protesters escape from a supermarket where they hid during one police raid in a shopping mall.
The huge crowds of hundreds of thousands of demonstrators at the start of the summer have given way to smaller groups of mobile protests using more aggressive tactics, such as lighting fires on roads and hurling objects toward police.
The fluid nature of the protests has presented a challenge for authorities, with demonstrators stretching police resources by using the subway to hop between districts. Late Sunday afternoon, thousands descended on tourist destinations and residential neighborhoods alike, building metal barricades and some throwing bricks and what police identified as smoke bombs.
Police said an officer was hospitalized with burns to his legs after being hit by a Molotov cocktail hurled by a protester.
The scenes contrasted with several other protests over the weekend, including a three-day peaceful sit-in at the airport, and marches on Saturday attended by elderly people and families who chanted against the government.
The protests reflect an outpouring of public anger at Hong Kong's government, sparked by an extradition bill that would allow those in the city to be tried under mainland China's opaque legal system. The Hong Kong government eventually shelved the bill, declaring it dead, but hasn't formally withdrawn it.
On Sunday, officers in some cases shot tear gas from police stations at demonstrators gathered nearby, then charged out to make arrests.
""Before, the police would try to disperse us, now they are rounding us up,"" said one protester, a teacher who would only give his name as Desmond.
In the Wan Chai area of Hong Kong island, lined with open-front bars and near the main police headquarters, there was little out of the ordinary at 5 p.m. Sunday, with patrons enjoying drinks. An hour later, protesters arrived and began building barricades and waving laser pointers at police. Soon, riot police fired multiple volleys of tear gas. Bars closed and hotels lowered their shutters, keeping guests inside. By 8:30 p.m., things were back to normal.
Across the harbor, a group of protesters threw bricks at a police station in the tourist hub of Tsim Sha Tsui. Live footage showed at least one fiery projectile that appeared to be a Molotov cocktail. One woman sustained a head wound and was taken to a hospital.
Hong Kong police said they have made nearly 600 arrests and fired more than 1,800 rounds of tear gas and at least 160 rubber bullets since the protests began two months before.
Kitty Chan, who has run a flower business in the Wan Chai market for four decades, said the usually busy street was almost empty because of the confrontation between protesters and the police, one block away from her stall.
""It has affected my business to some extent without a doubt,"" said Ms. Chan, adding that while she had empathy for both sides, she has had enough of the expanding demonstrations. ""I just hope everybody could use less violence.""

Bud Brewer IPO Should Go Down Smoothly,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
The world's largest brewer is taking another shot at an initial public offering of its Asian business. It should taste better this time.
Budweiser Brewing, the division of Anheuser-Busch InBev responsible for much of East and Southern Asia, has filed to list in Hong Kong again. The company canceled a similar project two months ago, citing reasons including market conditions. The previous plan to raise up to $9.8 billion would have been this year's largest IPO.
The Hong Kong market hasn't been doing great recently as protests continue. China's beer stocks, however, have bucked the trend: China Resources Beer, the country's largest brewer, is up 18% since Budweiser Brewing scrapped its IPO.
More important, AB InBev has learned lessons from the flop. The deal size is smaller, around $5 billion, partly because the company sold its Australian business to Japanese rival Asahi for $11.3 billion a week after it scrapped the IPO.
And the deal will include cornerstone investors, which were absent last time. Such backers commit to invest a certain amount with a lockup period, wherever the deal is priced. They are common in Hong Kong IPOs and should help the company to anchor demand.
The sale of the Australian business also should help Budweiser Brewing to get the high multiple it wanted. Last time, the company tried to pitch the IPO as a growth story when about half of its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization came from mature markets, including Australia. Now, nearly three-quarters of adjusted Ebitda comes from growth markets -- mainly China but also India and Vietnam. AB InBev is much more profitable than its rivals in China because it focuses on premium brands.
This should allow Budweiser Brewing to sell the IPO at a multiple closer to that of China Resources Beer, which has an enterprise value equal to 21 times forward Ebitda. Diversified brewers generally trade well below that. AB InBev, for example, fetches about 12 times.
Budweiser Brewing's IPO shouldn't leave AB InBev with any bitterness this time around.

"For China's Xi Jinping, Hong Kong Crisis Is Personal --- He stresses Beijing's authority over city, where his father has a legacy","BEIJING -- Four months before Xi Jinping became China's leader in late 2012, he issued a Communist Party edict on Hong Kong that reverberates today.
As head of a party committee overseeing the former British colony, Mr. Xi ordered officials to wage combat against what he saw as a growing separatist movement, according to a retired senior official responsible for Hong Kong affairs. ""We must dare to struggle and be good at fighting,"" the retired official said in describing Mr. Xi's approach.
Only a few Hong Kongers advocated independence back then, and they're still a tiny minority today. The kind of protests that have racked the city this year seemed unthinkable.
Mr. Xi's edict, though, was symptomatic of his intolerance of dissent and an imperious approach to government, which many political insiders and analysts say is now jeopardizing his most treasured ambition -- aunified Chinese nation.
While unifying China has preoccupied its leaders for centuries, Mr. Xi has made closer integration with Hong Kong and unity with Taiwan -- a self-governed island Beijing sees as its territory -- defining priorities of his leadership and key tenets of his ""China Dream"" of national rejuvenation. His edict was one of several steps Mr. Xi has taken to tighten Beijing's grip on Hong Kong, an effort that intensified after he became China'sleader.
Underpinning the approach were Mr. Xi's desires to forge a more centralized leadership andto build on the legacy of his late father, who decades earlier played a key role inreintegrating Hong Kong with the mainland.
Chinese officials publicly blame the turmoil in Hong Kong on foreign meddling and economic frustration. Privately, some admit they failed to appreciate public anger over the sense of gradual erosion, under Mr. Xi, of the city's relative political freedom.
""Everybody speaks the way that they think the top would like to hear,"" said Michael Tien, a pro-Beijing member of Hong Kong's legislature and China's national parliament who joined an August meeting with mainland officials to discuss the unrest. ""When the top hears the things that they would like to hear, they will further believe in the things that they believe in.""
Asked if young Hong Kongers' desire to express themselves politically was compatible with Mr. Xi's vision, Mr. Tien said: ""No. So that's a problem.""
The crisis looks certain to take the sheen off celebrations on Oct. 1 to mark the 70th anniversary of the Communist victory in 1949, which are aimed at showcasing progress toward the China Dream.
The unrest has undermined Hong Kong's role as a politically stable international financial center and conduit for capital in and out of China. It has damaged the ""one country, two systems"" formula that allowed the city to retain many freedoms after Chinese rule was restored in 1997.
That formula is also one Beijing touts as a model for unifying Taiwan with the mainland. Hong Kong's disarray has made such an arrangement less likely than ever in Taiwan, which has developed into a vibrant democracy over the past three decades.
The protests have boosted the electoral prospects of Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen, a vocal supporter of the Hong Kong protesters. Even her main rival, Han Kuo-yu of the Nationalist Party, which has favored closer ties with Beijing, has pledged never to allow ""one country, two systems"" in Taiwan.
Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office said the island's government played a ""disgraceful"" role, ""fanning the flames, and adding fuel to the fire"" to boost Ms. Tsai. China's cabinet information office and the agency responsible for Hong Kong affairs didn't respond to requests for comment.
While China has enhanced its international clout under Mr. Xi, many of his signature policies have faced difficulties. A global infrastructure building spree has run into resistance at home and abroad. His program to forcibly intern more than a million Chinese Muslims has become an international human-rights controversy. Little progress has been made on another signature project, the construction of a vast new city south of Beijing.
The Hong Kong crisis is fueling criticism within China's political, business and academic elite of Mr. Xi's autocratic leadership style, which prizes loyalty and discipline over initiative and policy debate.
There are no signs of an organized challenge to Mr. Xi's leadership within the elite, or of Hong Kong's protests spreading to the mainland.
In a recent meeting with a foreign leader, Mr. Xi indicated that Beijing prefers to allow the Hong Kong government to take the lead in resolving the crisis instead of intervening directly, according to people familiar with the matter. Yet those people say he is unwilling to let Hong Kong's leadership reach a political accommodation with the protesters that involves any significant concession.
Some party insiders and observers see shades of the regime's founder in Mr. Xi's instinct to show strength rather than seek dialogue and compromise.
""We can witness just today his belief that if you encounter problems, you have to escalate. And that is clear Mao,"" said Klaus Muhlhahn, professor of Chinese history at the Free University of Berlin.
Unifying China has been an obsession for many of its leaders since the first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, did so in 221 B.C. Hong Kong is a vital piece in the Communist Party's narrative of Chinese history, which portrays the 1839-1842 Opium War, after which the defeated Qing government ceded Hong Kong Island to Britain, as a key moment of national shame. The party has sought to bring Taiwan under its control ever since Mao's forces drove Chiang Kai-shek and his Nationalist government there seven decades ago.
For Mr. Xi, Hong Kong is personal. Xi Zhongxun, his father, was a prominent revolutionary who, as a top party official in the southern province of Guangdong from 1978 to 1980, confronted an exodus of mainlanders fleeing to Hong Kong as economic refugees.
Fearing that could undermine the party, he cultivated ties with Hong Kong officials and businessmen and tried to narrow the economic gap, including by setting up mainland China's first ""special economic zone"" and encouraging investment from Hong Kong.
""Xi Zhongxun became the face of the People's Republic to Hong Kong after the nightmare of the Cultural Revolution,"" said Joseph Torigian, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""We know that Xi Jinping cares a lot about his father's legacy.""
Xi Jinping visited Hong Kong several times to drum up investment for the mainland. On a trip in 2005, he praised it as a globally competitive commercial center.
By the early 2000s, however, Beijing was beginning to see the city less as worthy of emulation and more as a wellspring of trouble.
In 2003, protests in Hong Kong against a bill outlawing actions deemed subversive to Beijing forced the city's government to withdraw the legislation. Beijing officials feared Hong Kongers had been imbued with Western political values during British rule.
Still, in the years leading up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, opinion polls showed Hong Kongers developing more confidence in the ""one country, two systems"" idea. Beijing decided in late 2007 Hong Kong residents could start electing their leader in a decade's time.
Mr. Xi drew a warm welcome on a Hong Kong visit in July 2008, by which time he was a member of China's top leadership body -- the Politburo Standing Committee -- and the head of the party's coordination group for Hong Kong and Macau policy. But he ruffled feathers by urging the city's executive, legislature and judiciary to cooperate with each other, an early sign of Beijing's more interventionist approach.
Mr. Xi oversaw a drive to educate Hong Kongers about China's achievements. In 2010, the city's government said schools would introduce a new subject: Moral and National Education. Many young Hong Kong residents and their parents denounced the effort as brainwashing. Opinion polls showed that a growing number of the city's people began to identify as Hong Kongers rather than Chinese.
Mr. Xi sensed the rise of a separatist movement, according to Chen Zuo'er, a former deputy director of the Chinese government's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office. In July 2012 Mr. Xi ""issued the party center's first combat order to purge Hong Kong independence elements,"" Mr. Chen said, according to a transcript of a speech he gave in 2017.
Later, a second surge of unrest forced Hong Kong's government to shelve the Moral and National Education plan.
Mr. Xi became China's leader in November 2012. He soon started to upend the Communist Party's collective leadership system, eventually taking personal charge of all major decision-making.
In a marked shift from his predecessors, Mr. Xi stressed that Beijing exercised ""overall governance authority"" over Hong Kong. A June 2014 government white paper warned against ""confused or lopsided"" perceptions of Hong Kong's status and said its partial autonomy came ""solely from the authorization by the central leadership.""
Beijing offered a plan to let Hong Kongers vote on their next chief executive -- so long as candidates were screened by the central leadership. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets in fall 2014 to reject that plan.
Mr. Xi now saw himself as being locked in a struggle for control of Hong Kong that he described as ""long-term, complex and at times sharp,"" according to the 2017 speech by Mr. Chen, the retired official.
""The trees want tranquility but the winds won't stop,"" he quoted Mr. Xi as saying.
Hong Kong's authorities adopted a hard line against leaders of the 2014 protests. Chinese security agents abducted or detained five Hong Kong booksellers and held them in the mainland for investigation. Most have since been released but remain monitored.
By the time Mr. Xi visited Hong Kong in mid-2017, it looked as though his strategy was working. ""Hong Kong has joined the remarkable journey toward the great renewal of the Chinese nation,"" he proclaimed. Then came a warning: Challenging Beijing's power, Mr. Xi said, ""is an act that crosses the red line.""
""As President Xi says, one country is one country,"" said Ip Kwok-him, a nonofficial member of Hong Kong's Executive Council and deputy to China's parliament. ""It's no longer about accommodating Hong Kong's needs.""
For almost two years afterward, Hong Kong's democracy movement languished. Then, after the city's government this February proposed a bill allowing extradition of criminal suspects to the mainland, opposition began to swell.
While some political figures in Hong Kong accuse its government of emulating Mr. Xi's intolerance of dissent, others blame Beijing's representatives in the city for overreaching in an attempt to please the Chinese leader.
""President Xi of course has a more serious manner when looking at the Hong Kong issues,"" said Ma Fung-kwok, a pro-Beijing member of Hong Kong's legislature and China's national parliament. ""He has been quite demanding on many aspects, so you can see that the liaison office here is more proactive.""
Maybe Beijing's representatives in Hong Kong ""are pushing too hard,"" Mr. Ma said.
Mr. Xi has largely stayed silent on the Hong Kong protests. In a Sept. 3 speech at Beijing's Central Party School, he identified Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan affairs as among the major challenges to his China Dream.
A critical question now is whether he would use force to protect his vision of a unified China.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam told business leaders last month that Beijing didn't have plans for a military crackdown, according to a leaked recording published by Reuters.
With thousands of paramilitary police still massed on the border, others aren't so sure. ""I do know that it is a last resort,"" said Mr. Tien, the pro-Beijing Hong Kong legislator. ""In the end, it's up to the decision of one person.""

Hong Kong Throngs As Beijing Retreats,"Hong Kong -- Nathan Law, 25, was the youngest person ever elected to Hong Kong Legislative Council. For his pro-democracy activism, he's faced jail, tear gas and rubber bullets. He's certainly on Beijing's enemies list. In an interview he confided his deepest fear. ""To be very honest,"" he told me Thursday, ""I'm most afraid Hong Kong people will not care anymore."" It's increasingly clear that Chinese President Xi Jinping wants to subsume the small city-state, and there didn't seem to be much Hong Kong people could do to stop it. Mr. Law said he was afraid ""about Hong Kong people becoming cynical, full of apathy, or they just won't care.""
Yet on Sunday, a crowd estimated at nearly two million -- roughly a quarter of the city's population -- marched from Victoria Park to the Legislative Council building to take a stand for Hong Kong's autonomy. They stretched as far I could see in either direction, spilling into parallel streets. It was the third mass protest in eight days. After the first two, the resolve of China and Hong Kong's pro-Beijing officials appeared to waver.
Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam had been pushing legislation that would authorize the city to extradite criminal suspects to the mainland -- ""the legalized kidnapping of HK people to China,"" as one protester's poster described it. Foreigners would also be in peril.
But amid the public backlash, Ms. Lam announced Saturday that she would indefinitely suspend the legislation. On Sunday she issued a statement that ""the chief executive apologizes to the public"" for ""causing disappointment and grief among the people."" She said there is ""no timetable"" for picking the bill back up.
The suspension is significant. Hong Kong's political system is rigged to ensure pro-Beijing lawmakers hold a legislative majority. In practice the chief executive answers to Beijing, not to voters. Ms. Lam's announcement means that Hong Kong protesters forced Beijing and the chief executive to retreat.
The question is whether the victory will stick. ""We don't like the word 'temporary,'"" pro-democracy legislator Claudia Mo said. ""It's just delaying the pain."" Ms. Lam ""said 'suspend,' meaning to put it to a pause,"" said Edward Chin, a hedge-fund manager who has rallied support for pro-democracy activists among Hong Kong finance workers. ""A pause is not good enough.""
Protesters' demands have expanded along with their numbers. Mr. Law said one goal now is to force Ms. Lam's resignation. At several points on Sunday protesters shouted in unison for her to step down. Sunday's marchers also demanded accountability for police violence Wednesday, when officers fired more than 150 canisters of tear gas -- more than they used during the 79 days of the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement in 2014. They also fired beanbags and rubber bullets into the crowd. More than 70 were injured.
""What happened Wednesday is really what brought so many people to the streets -- parents and the politically inactive majority -- to stand up for the young people,"" said Esther Chung, 52, a secondary-school teacher. Moon Kwok, a social worker who says she's not normally political, agreed: ""This time is different. We saw the younger generation fighting for their lives, for their freedom. We had to do something about it.""
Sunday's protesters went out of their way to demonstrate their peaceful intentions. Several signs proclaimed that they were ""not rioters."" They assiduously picked up their trash. The densest crowds miraculously parted to let ambulances pass. On Saturday a man had fallen and died after hanging up a protest banner near Pacific Place, a tragedy invoked frequently throughout the day. Demonstrators carried lilies and baby's breath and heaped the flowers at a makeshift memorial.
By Sunday night the mood felt less tense, more hopeful, perhaps even cautiously celebratory. Hong Kong's protesters still have plenty to fear. But the past week has seen an extraordinary ""revival of activism,"" Mr. Law observes. ""It means what I fear the most is not true.""

World News: Risk of Recession Grows for Asia Commercial Hub,"HONG KONG -- Pro-democracy unrest sweeping Hong Kong is threatening to tip the trading hub into recession for the first time since the global financial crisis a decade ago, as uncertainty grips an economy already buffeted by the U.S.-China trade war.
With a summer of protests showing no sign of abating, crucial industries such as tourism and retail sales are suffering as visitors postpone trips and stores close amid violent conflicts. More ominously, anxiety about Hong Kong's future risks crimping long-term investment decisions, experts say.
As a result, several research houses that had forecast slight growth for the $363 billion economy in the third quarter now expect a quarter-on-quarter contraction, the second such decline in a row and a technical definition of recession. For the full year, Hong Kong's outlook has fallen by around half to 1% growth, new estimates show.
The economic damage may be permanent, observers say. Hong Kong has weathered political crises before. But this one has raised the specter of military intervention by mainland China, a move most believe would end Hong Kong's status as a free-market linkage point between China and the West. While the chances remain remote, the fact that it is even a possibility could deter investment for years to come.
""Right now, it looks like we're in an endless tunnel of turmoil. But even if there's a solution tomorrow, you've already seeded the idea that there could be further uncertainty down the road, and that will deter business decisions by foreign investors,"" said Tommy Wu, senior Asia economist at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong.
In recent days, Mr. Wu revised his quarter-on-quarter growth figure for the July-September period to minus 0.3%.
""We're a Hong Kong business, and like all businesses that are based here, we're feeling the impact of local political unrest,"" John Slosar, chairman of Hong Kong's flagship airline Cathay Pacific Ltd., told reporters this week. He said the protests have cut inbound traffic in July and put a dent in future reservations.
""We are very concerned about the impact of the current situation on the economy and reputation of the city,"" said Clement Kwok, chief executive of Hongkong & Shanghai Hotels, which runs the iconic Peninsula Hong Kong in a popular harborside shopping district. The hotel had a double-digit fall in occupancy in July, its worst performance since the city was hit by severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in 2003.
The weakening economy is sure to add pressure on the city's Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who is facing calls for her resignation. She is blamed for sparking the protests by pushing a law to speed extradition of Hong Kong residents for trial in mainland China, enraging locals in the semiautonomous region of China. Hong Kong is grounded in values like rule of law and freedom of expression that aren't protected in the mainland.
More than two months later, some observers say Mrs. Lam missed chances to defuse the protest movement and has instead exacerbated it by refusing to acknowledge anyprotester demands, such as permanent retraction of the extradition law.
The protesters, mostly young people who see themselves as fighters for democracy in a life-or-death struggle for their futures, are unlikely to be deterred by economic concerns.
In July, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong said the crisis had hurt member businesses and instilled anxiety about the future. In a poll, a majority of members called on Hong Kong leaders to drop the controversial extradition bill that sparked the protests and meet other protester demands.
""We are now in the worst-case scenario, where the government chooses to toughen its stance on protesters,"" said Kevin Lai, a Hong Kong-based economist at Daiwa Capital Markets. Mr. Lai now forecasts the economy will shrink to minus 0.8% in the third quarter from the previous quarter, and he said a recession was inevitable.
On Friday Mrs. Lam, who retains support from Beijing, said the economic impact had been worse than the 2003 SARS epidemic and blamed it on violent protesters. She vowed to take measures to boost the economy and protect Hong Kong's image.
""This economic downturn is very fast, some people have described it as a coming tsunami,"" Mrs. Lam said.
At a separate news conference, Finance Secretary Paul Chan said: ""If the weakness continues in the third quarter of this year, we'll technically enter into a recession.""
Officials from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority have sought to send out reassuring signals regarding possible risks such as capital flight and short selling against the local currency, citing high capital requirements and massive reserves.
The MSCI Hong Kong index has fallen around 9% since the protests began in June.

Global Risks Send Investors on Haven Search,"The U.K. Parliament's decision to postpone a final vote on the country's exit from the European Union marks the latest geopolitical development likely to swing financial markets, highlighting the extreme levels of uncertainty that some investors worry isn't being properly accounted for with U.S. stocks near all-time highs.
The U.S.-China trade war, Britain leaving the EU and impeachment proceedings in the U.S. are just some of the major political obstacles facing investors. Adding to the uncertainty are the Turkish military operation in Syria, attacks on Saudi oil production and social unrest spanning from Hong Kong to Barcelona.
In response, some investors are boosting holdings of cash and other assets that tend to hold their value when markets turn rocky. Others are recommending strategies that could protect against a swift downturn.
Investments that prioritize safety from volatility could become even more popular after Saturday's vote by the U.K. Parliament, which potentially further extends a three-year-plus period of deep uncertainty. The vote forced the government to ask formally for another Brexit delay, although Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged EU leaders not to grant an extension, and his government said there was still time to leave, as planned, at the end of the month.
To capture just how much recent flare-ups around the world compare with previous levels of political upheaval, professors at Northwestern University, Stanford University and the University of Chicago created a variety of indexes that measure levels of global uncertainty.
One index, which captures a range of political and economic uncertainties, rose in August to its highest level on record in data that go back to 1997. It was even more extreme than after previous events such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, the European debt crisis and the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The most recent reading in September was the fourth highest on record.
""I think political uncertainty is clearly far higher than it has been for a long time,"" said Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford and one of the creators of the uncertainty indexes.
He said a ""toxic combination"" of low growth and rising income inequality has contributed to more extreme political uncertainty.
A separate index that focuses only on uncertainty in global trade policy has surged to around 100 so far this year. From 1996 through 2018, its average level was about 2.
""The number of political risks that could seriously move markets [is] as high as we have seen,"" said Erik Knutzen, multiclass chief investment officer at Neuberger Berman, who has recently increased his holdings of cash.
At the same time, he said U.S. stocks are still likely to gain over the long haul -- partly because the Fed still has much more room to cut interest rates than other major central banks have.
Mr. Knutzen has recently raised his exposure to U.S. small-capitalization companies to above his fund's benchmark levels and raised his exposure to U.S. large-caps to equal the benchmark.
""It's a view that the U.S. is the best-positioned economy of all the developed world economies,"" he said. ""It's not exactly scintillating growth, but it's much better than what we expect from Europe and Japan.""
While politics and trade have prompted swings in recent months, investors also remain focused on other key drivers of markets. Those include earnings for companies in the S&P 500, which are projected to post the biggest drop since 2016 in the third quarter, dulling some expectations for stock-market returns.
About 150 S&P companies will report results and conduct earnings calls in each of the next two weeks.
Bellwether companies including Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Procter & Gamble Co. and Boeing Co. are among the companies that are slated to report their results this week.
Large, multinational companies have been heavily affected by softening global growth and trade uncertainty, and rising correlations across asset classes have fueled fears that a reversal in momentum could drag down a range of investments at the same time. That trend played out late in 2018, another period when sentiment was fragile and news about trade policy and interest rates punished stocks around the world.
""In some ways, there's literally nowhere to hide today,"" said Michael Parker, director of research and head of strategy for Asia-Pacific at Bernstein Research in Hong Kong.
Instead of getting caught up in the gyrating political headlines, he said his firm recently devised a quantitative strategy that uses a variety of macroeconomic indicators to forecast market returns.
The model suggests a favorable scenario for stocks in Asia excluding Japan despite the political uncertainty, he said.
""While it would be professionally inadvisable to tell anyone to turn off the news, there's other stuff going on that doesn't always show up in the headlines,"" Mr. Parker said.
One such political concern is the monthslong protests in Hong Kong.
Weiqi Zhu, who runs an equity fund at Gao Zheng Asset Management, said he sold all of his positions in local Hong Kong companies over the summer, including property developers and retailers, because of concern over how the antigovernment demonstrations and the heightened geopolitical risk with China will weigh specifically on those companies' business models.
""The social unrest in the long run is going to impact these companies a lot,"" said Mr. Zhu, who has also been holding higher-than-usual levels of cash.
Many investors have turned to haven investments and hedges involving futures and options in case volatility returns.
Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers, said she favors gold and the Japanese yen given the ever-changing geopolitical backdrop.
""You've had to be ready to adjust your positioning more quickly than before,"" she said. ""We've tried not to trade every single development when the underlying economic backdrop is relatively supportive.""

Tiffany Receives Offer From LVMH,"Tiffany & Co. has received a takeover approach from LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which is seeking to add the iconic U.S. jeweler to its portfolio of upscale brands.
The French company sent Tiffany officials a letter in the past couple of weeks outlining an all-cash takeover bid of about $120 a share, according to people familiar with the matter. That would value Tiffany at close to $14.5 billion.
The companies aren't in talks but Tiffany is expected to work quickly on a response, some of the people said. Even though the bid represents a premium of 30% or more to where Tiffany traded when the offer was made, according to one of the people, LVMH is expected to have to pay up even more if it wants to clinch the deal.
Shares of New York-based Tiffany closed Friday at $98.55, giving it a market value of nearly $12 billion.
The stock reached nearly $140 a share during the summer of 2018.
LVMH has a market value of 193 billion euros ($214 billion). On Saturday, Bloomberg reported on LVMH's interest in Tiffany.
Buying Tiffany would increase Paris-based LVMH's exposure to jewelry, one of the fastest-growing businesses in the luxury sector.
In 2018, the global jewelry market grew 7% and was worth about 18 billion euros, according to Bain & Co. Tiffany, with more than 300 stores globally, is one of the world's largest jewelers, along with Cartier and LVMH-owned Bulgari, but it has been unable to keep pace with European rivals.
Tiffany, which has about $4 billion in annual revenue, has struggled with lackluster sales growth for years.
The 182-year-old brand has been trying to rebuild its business after ousting its chief executive two years ago amid pressure from an activist investor. The stock, which had slumped near $60 in 2016, has been hovering around $100 for much of the past year.
Under CEO Alessandro Bogliolo, the jeweler has pushed an expansion into China, with plans to open flagship stores in several major cities. The chain, which relies heavily on tourist spending in the U.S. market, also has been renovating its flagship New York store on Fifth Avenue.
Tiffany also has tried to broaden its appeal with marketing that includes more minorities and same-sex couples, added new products for younger shoppers and introduced a jewelry line for men.
But in recent quarters sales have slipped both in the U.S. and Asia. Excluding currency swings, comparable sales have declined from a year earlier for two straight quarters. In August, executives cautioned that the protests in Hong Kong and a macroeconomic slowdown could damp profits for the rest of the year.
Luxury-goods companies have been pressured by fears of an economic slowdown in China, where shoppers account for about one-third of luxury-goods purchases world-wide. Escalating trade tensions also have played a part in waning consumer confidence in China.
Tiffany would be one of the biggest acquisitions yet by Bernard Arnault, LVMH's chief executive and controlling shareholder. Mr. Arnault paid 12 billion euros in 2017 to unite the storied fashion house Christian Dior with LVMH.
LVMH, which has about $50 billion in annual revenue, also relies on Chinese shoppers for a chunk of its sales. But the conglomerate is so large and has so many brands -- from Louis Vuitton to Dom Perignon -- that it has fared better than Tiffany in recent years. Revenue jumped in its latest quarter, showing little impact from the Hong Kong protests or the U.S.-China trade tensions.
LVMH could use its deep pockets to develop product lines where Tiffany is weak. In addition to Bulgari, LVMH owns luxury watchmakers Hublot and TAG Heuer.
""Tiffany has yet to express its full potential -- for example in design jewelry and watches,"" said Bernstein & Co. analyst Luca Solca.
The deal would significantly expand LVMH's presence in the U.S., giving it more exposure to U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and reducing foreign-exchange risk, Mr. Solca said.
Tiffany's Mr. Bogliolo is familiar with LVMH; he spent 16 years at Bulgari before LVMH took control of the company in 2011 and then served as North American operating chief at LVMH's Sephora unit for a little more than a year. Before joining Tiffany, he was CEO of Italian apparel company Diesel SpA.

"World News: Hong Kong Bars Activist From Run --- Election official cites Wong's political views, in a move that risks reinvigorating protests","HONG KONG -- Authorities barred prominent democracy activist Joshua Wong from running in local elections scheduled for November, citing his political views, a move that risks inflaming an opposition protest movement that has seen momentum in the streets wane in recent weeks.
The electoral officer who rejected the 23-year-old's candidacy for a district council seat said her conclusion was based on Mr. Wong's previous statements that independence from China could be an option for the city, a view at odds with the Basic Law, the city's mini-constitution.
Mr. Wong, who has said publicly he doesn't support independence, accused authorities of taking orders from Beijing -- official media has branded him a separatist in the past -- regarding his candidacy.
In recent years, Hong Kong has increasingly barred candidates from taking part in elections. Authorities often cite concerns that candidates support separatism or don't support China's sovereignty over the city through the ""one country, two systems"" policy.
Mr. Wong was the only candidate to be blocked from the elections. There are many other pro-democracy campaigners among those contesting the 452 seats up for votes.
The disqualifying of candidates, many of them young, has exacerbated fears of shrinking freedoms at the root of recent unrest in the city. Young people on the front lines of the monthslong protests have complained that they have been driven to violence in part because their representative voices have been shut out of public office.
Banning Mr. Wong -- a student leader of protests in 2014 who has visited Washington to press Congress to support Hong Kong's democracy movement -- runs another risk. Any backlash could derail the Nov. 24 elections, as the government has threatened to call off the voting if there is violence.
In the decision detailing the reasons for invalidating Mr. Wong's candidacy, electoral officer Laura Aron said she had considered Mr. Wong's public statements since 2016 and his replies to electoral officers' questions. She said she found that his stance on independence and self-determination has been consistent and that he and the youth political group he co-founded take the position that Hong Kong independence is an option.
In a separate statement, government officials said support for Hong Kong self-determination was inconsistent with the law.
Mr. Wong, speaking to reporters after the decision, said he had clearly stated that he doesn't support independence. He added that the officer was listening to the Communist Party's official People's Daily newspaper and its accusations about his positions.
He urged voters to support Kelvin Lam, a pro-democracy candidate who entered the race in his constituency. He also said the decision would encourage more Hong Kongers to take to the streets.
""The decision to ban me from running for office is clearly politically driven,"" he added later. ""Everyone would know that the true reason is my identity, Joshua Wong, is the crime in their mind.""
The district council seats up for election make up almost all of the city's 18 local councils. Pro-democracy candidates are challenging establishment members for a large number of them, hoping that widespread antigovernment sentiment will deliver big gains.
District councilors act as representatives for their constituencies on matters such as government programs and public facilities.

Bud Brewer Tries Asian IPO Again,"The world's largest brewer is taking a second shot at listing its Asian business, seeking to raise as much as $7.6 billion in Hong Kong, even as the city reels from a summer of protests and from trade tensions between the U.S. and China.
The regional unit of brewing behemoth Anheuser-Busch InBev SA said on Tuesday it would begin taking orders the following day for its Hong Kong initial public offering, ahead of a planned listing on Sept. 30.
The unit, Budweiser Brewing Co. APAC, plans to raise a baseline 34 billion to 37.9 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$4.35 billion to US$4.85 billion) by selling new shares, at a market value of US$45.6 billion to US$50.7 billion. If demand is strong, AB InBev could boost the deal's size to as much as US$7.6 billion.
In July, AB InBev shelved an earlier attempt to list the business, after seeking to raise nearly US$10 billion, at a valuation of as much as US$63.7 billion. It said market conditions were partly to blame, but some prospective investors and analysts pointed to its high valuation aspirations.
It is now marketing a smaller, faster-growing business that is more focused on China and other emerging markets, after selling its Australian unit -- which had been part of the original listing plan -- to Japan's Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. for US$11.3 billion.
""We are even more of a growth company than two months ago, when we were first here,"" Budweiser APAC Chief Executive Jan Craps told a news conference. ""We believe now is the right moment to do the IPO.""
The revised stock sale would be the world's second-largest IPO this year, after ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies' $8.1 billion market debut in New York, according to Dealogic.
Unlike the last attempt, this time Budweiser APAC has secured a US$1 billion pledge from Singaporean sovereign-wealth fund GIC Pte. Ltd. to act as a cornerstone investor.
Many Hong Kong listings use cornerstone investors, which invest wherever the deal prices, to help entice other prospective buyers.
Vincent Wen, an investment manager at KCG Securities Asia, said the addition of a prominent cornerstone could help ensure that this sale goes more smoothly.
Social unrest, the U.S.-China trade dispute and slowing Chinese growth are threatening to tip Hong Kong's economy into recession. Sometimes-violent protests have disrupted flights and road transport, denting the city's image as a safe location and an international financial hub.
The benchmark Hang Seng stock index fell in late July and August but has since rebounded somewhat, leaving it down just 1.6% for the three months to Tuesday's close.
""We can't deny it's a volatile and challenging environment today, but we believe Hong Kong is still the best financial center in Asia for us to do the listing,"" Mr. Craps said.
Many issuers are testing investors' appetite in both the equity and bond markets in Hong Kong, such as China's Shanghai Henlius Biotech Inc.
The Budweiser APAC deal's price range equates to 33.8 to 37.5 times the earnings that management estimates the business could make next year, according to a summary of terms seen by The Wall Street Journal.
That is broadly in line with Hong Kong-listed Chinese brewers China Resources Beer Holdings Co. and Tsingtao Brewery Co. They trade at nearly 40 and roughly 30 times forecast 2020 earnings, respectively, Refinitiv data show, after sharp gains this year.
AB InBev brews one in four of the world's beers and owns hundreds of brands, including Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona. But the deal making saddled the brewer with debts, which it aims to shrink to about US$80 billion.
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and China International Capital Corp. are joint global coordinators for the offering.

"Declarations: Beijing, Brexit and Pushing It Too Far","This is on the danger of pushing it too far. It is a delicate business knowing what the moment will allow. You can be right in intent and wrong on execution, and if you're wrong on that it may not matter you were right in intent. A great woman in business and the arts once told me the most dangerous place to be is significantly ahead of the curve. People will dismiss you as too far out. Better to be just a little ahead of the curve, which allows people to wonder if you might be a visionary. She in fact was a visionary, and careful not to seem too many steps ahead.
A great challenge in politics and diplomacy is to see in real time the line between the opening that should be pursued and the trap that must be avoided. And, once you've made that calculation, not to push things too far. It can be delicate. You have to be like a safecracker who files down his fingers so he'll feel every click.
China pushed Hong Kong too far the past few years, bullying it, trying to pull it into a closer, more smothering political embrace. Hong Kong pushed back. Are the demonstrators now pushing it too far? I hope not but fear they may be. They've already won -- humiliating the chief executive, who this week backed down on the issue that sparked the rebellion, and embarrassing China, which found itself with a World Opinion Catastrophe on its hands. The demonstrators made a statement, successfully -- not easy to do in this world. They asserted certain implicit boundaries for Chinese behavior. They gave it a warning: push Hong Kong around and the price will be unrest and humiliation.
The protesters have sustained their demonstrations and vow they will continue. They demand firmer autonomy and more democracy. China, angry at the disruptions, some violent, and shutdowns, had already moved forces closer. Will Beijing again push things too far? Will it intervene militarily? Is a collision with world-wide implications coming?
I hope the demonstrators know what they're doing and aren't pushing it too far.
The Democratic presidential candidates are pushing it too far. No left-wing idea is too much. Nothing, no sense of political reality, is hemming them in. They are like progressive Barry Goldwaters: Moderation in pursuit of justice is no virtue. The president meanwhile is so crazily taken with his own power that he redraws hurricane maps.
Everyone is pushing it too far. My way of explaining this to myself is that everyone now making decisions grew up in the past 60 years, a time of historic wealth creation, human growth, relative stability. And they can't help it, they think this is normal. They think life is nice! They've lost a tragic sense about history. They often accuse those who disagree with them of being on ""the wrong side of history,"" as if it has a side, as if it flows ever upward.
It's odd but in this cynical age they've grown too trusting of good fortune.
They assume no one will, through accident, miscalculation or madness, launch a nuclear missile. They assume these robots we're inventing, the artificial intelligence, will ultimately be benign -- the authorities will make sure they don't make life monstrous. And so the busy geniuses in their genius campuses, all born in stability, mostly born in a postpatriotic and post-Christian West in which old loyalties not only lessened but came to be seen as wicked, are doing their thing, largely unregulated and in secret.
Don't you think it will all turn out well and only benefit mankind?
No. You think they'll push it too far.
One thing I miss is the Professional Worriers who populated previous generations in government. They were a special type in foreign affairs, men who were by nature concerned that some international move or eruption would result in ""heightened tensions"" and ""instability"" and who counseled ""prudence."" They were usually veteran diplomats. They were extremely boring. They were always cautioning. They were worth their weight in gold. They didn't trust history -- they'd seen it go bad before World War II, in Korea and Vietnam. So they were careful. They never wanted to push it too far.
I end with Britain and the Brexit saga, which turned chaotic this week in Parliament with a series of defeats for the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, and defections and expulsions on the Conservative side, including the resignation of Mr. Johnson's brother.
What a lot of wreckage.
A real crisis isn't about ""someone will lose and someone will win""; it's about ""something will be changed -- a reality that reigned in the past won't be reigning anymore.""
Brexit is a real crisis.
The cultural composition of the Conservative Party is being changed. Out are the great and stately -- Winston Churchill's grandson Nicholas Soames and former Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke. In are the crazy-haired and bodacious, technocrats and internet gurus. Out is austerity, in is high spending. All this echoes changes in American conservative thinking and style.
When Boris Johnson was elected I wondered: Is he the brute and brilliant force who can resolve this thing? Is he the only animal big enough to fight European leaders who will do anything to stop the jailbreak?
This week the only question was: At this extraordinary moment is Boris playing some grand and subtle strategy only he can see? Or is he flying by the seat of his pants, making it up as he goes along. Is he operating on anything that might be called a plan?
The question reached one of his most committed parliamentary supporters, who replied: ""Bismarck never had a plan, he always improvised."" Meaning, I think: Mr. Johnson doesn't have a plan, sometimes you can't make one.
His objective isn't wrong. A great nation cannot be at its own throat forever. Britain has endured destructive uncertainty for more than three years. Enough: It must be one thing or another, in Europe or not. The voters chose not. Exactly how Britain leaves it must be legislated.
Leadership in such a moment needs not only wit, presence and charisma, which Mr. Johnson has. It requires judgment, trustworthiness -- that people have confidence in your thinking, your word. It is in those areas that Mr. Johnson fails.
Almost everything he did this week looked like pushing it too far.
A month ago he seemed the solution. He looks now the problem.
At this point Mr. Johnson should remember that politics is a game of addition, not subtraction, and limit the wreckage of the past week by taking back into the party those he threw out.
Sooner or later he'll get the election he's asking for, and it will likely put him against Labour's Jeremy Corbyn, whose ideology amounts to a daily pushing-it-too-far. Mr. Johnson would be the favorite. Britain is always stronger than it thinks: It has a thriving economy and tough, capable economic players. And as it showed when Mr. Soames's grandfather was in charge, it knows how to fight for its life. It can take Brexit. What it can't take is Mr. Corbyn and Brexit.
So ends my paean to moderation -- to not assuming things will go well, to a kind of watchfulness toward history. To not pushing it too far.

World News: Money Helps Explain Why China Values Hong Kong,"HONG KONG -- Since China resumed control of Hong Kong in 1997, the city has served as a conduit for trillions of dollars in fundraising, trade and investment.
Having a separate system -- sealed off, yet under Beijing's thumb -- caused a raft of social and political concerns that gave rise to this year's protests, now in their fifth month. But the city also enabled China's rise.
Today, Hong Kong makes up a much smaller part of China's overall economy than it did 22 years ago. Its role as a gateway, though, remains undiminished, meaning China faces a substantial financial cost for any crackdown.
George Magnus, an economist and the author of ""Red Flags: Why Xi's China Is in Jeopardy,"" said Hong Kong stands out from its mainland rivals for its rule of law, competent regulators, low taxes, free movement of capital and use of English.
Neither Shanghai nor China's free-trade zones ""can really compete with what Hong Kong is and does,"" he said.
Since 1997, mainland Chinese companies have raised $335 billion by floating in Hong Kong, tapping a broader range of shareholders than they could onshore.
Over the years, the pool of capital available at home has gotten much larger. But since the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to its U.S. equivalent, and the city has no capital controls, a listing there can generate hard currency for foreign takeovers and investments. It would be harder to use a Shanghai stock sale for the same goal.
For technology firms and others, New York has been another favored listing destination, but worsening U.S.-China relations could make this more problematic. Hong Kong offers a convenient way to tap many investors who are familiar with China.
For global investors, Shanghai and Shenzhen have become more accessible. But investors typically prefer Hong Kong's legal protections, and they have other concerns about mainland markets, including the difficulties of moving money out.
Chinese entities also borrow liberally through Hong Kong, both via bank loans and through bond issues.
Hong Kong is by far the largest offshore center for bond sales by Chinese firms. Companies can borrow for longer than they can onshore and, crucially, can raise funds in hard currency, said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia economist at investment bank Natixis.
When it comes to dollar bonds, big state-backed banks and industrial companies even prefer to sell these in Hong Kong, said Victor Shih, a scholar of China's politics and financial system at the University of California, San Diego. U.S. deals would be overseen by American regulators and would require greater disclosure.
Hong Kong is a preferred location for Chinese and international financiers or businesspeople to conduct transactions because it has a Western-style legal and regulatory system that is seen as fair and nonpolitical.
For now, that is a big competitive advantage over Shanghai or Shenzhen. Hong Kong's now-scrapped extradition bill, which sparked this year's protests, had raised fears that the two legal systems would grow closer together.
Foreign companies and state investors have long used Hong Kong as a staging post for investing in companies or building facilities in mainland China. As it grows richer, China is also deploying larger sums abroad through foreign direct investment, which rose from $2.6 billion in 1997 to $143 billion last year, according to data from China's Ministry of Commerce. Much of this outbound FDI goes through Hong Kong.
In some cases, Chinese money is ""round-tripped"" out through Hong Kong and back onshore, perhaps to take advantage of preferential terms for foreign investment.

World News: Hong Kong March Opens Door to Dialogue,"By holding a massive peaceful march after two months of tear-gas-soaked demonstrations, Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement has stepped up pressure on the city's Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam, to enter into dialogue to resolve the crisis.
The stakes are high for Mrs. Lam, who is widely blamed for allowing local opposition to an extradition law she proposed to mushroom into a full-blown antigovernment protest movement capable of putting hundreds of thousands on the streets chanting for everything from her resignation to greater voting rights for citizens.
A failure to find a political resolution could send Hong Kong hurtling back to the social unrest of past weeks with unforeseen consequences, experts say. Mainland China has repeatedly suggested it could deploy its own security forces -- and even its military -- to restore order in the semiautonomous Chinese city if local officials can't manage it themselves.
Adding to the pressure, the turmoil in Hong Kong has attracted growing attention of world leaders. President Trump has warned that U.S.-China trade talks could be affected by the outcome in Hong Kong.
""The only way to bring us back from the brink of crisis is government concessions,"" said Ching Kwan Lee, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Los Angeles.
But deep into a summer of protest, Mrs. Lam, a 62-year-old career civil servant, has seemingly lacked the willingness and even the latitude to hold discussions with opposition figures or grant concessions. In recent weeks, Mrs. Lam has rejected requests for talks, after protesters opposed to a planned extradition bill stormed the city's legislature in July. She has shrugged off calls from her own aides and business leaders to start talks that might lead to a political solution as the protest movement has grown.
Meantime, Mrs. Lam must take her cues from Beijing, where officials have presented a hard-line attitude against Hong Kong's protesters, fearing that countenancing dissent in one part of China risks encouraging it in others. Chinese officials responsible for affairs in Hong Kong for the time being oppose any immediate concessions to protesters, even if Mrs. Lam felt so inclined, people familiar with the matter say.
Mrs. Lam told reporters Tuesday she would start work on dialogue with people from all backgrounds and political platforms, though none were specified.
""We want to reach out to the community,"" Mrs. Lam said, adding that it was harder to do so earlier because the situation was unstable. Referring to the large number of citizens who have marched peacefully, she said: ""We are very sincere about talking to all those people to find a way out for Hong Kong.""
Officials in Beijing and Hong Kong are clinging to hope that the protest movement will wane when students return to schools and universities in the coming weeks, officials and aides say. In this best-case scenario, Hong Kong's leadership could reward the calm with economic measures and dialogue about the city's future, officials said.
Many in Hong Kong, however, see these days as a vital opening. ""Saying there should be a meeting when things have calmed down is useless,"" said veteran democracy fighter Lee Cheuk-yan, general secretary of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions. ""It's when there is a crisis that there should be talks.""
Mrs. Lam is slated to give a policy speech in October, raising expectations that she will announce a series of economic measures designed to boost Hong Kong's middle and working classes, largely left out of the city's long property boom.
As Sunday's march, which drew hundreds of thousands, came to a close, a spokesman for the local government said it would ""begin sincere dialogue with the public, mend social rifts and rebuild social harmony when everything has calmed down.""
Some business leaders expressed optimism that the march could lead to dialogue.
""Yesterday was a good barometer for Hong Kong -- that many people want a more peaceful way forward,"" said Allan Zeman, a businessman who is an economic adviser to Mrs. Lam's administration.
The government's pledge to listen, however, gave few specifics, lowering many expectations for a quick resolution.
""Why is it so hard for the government to open the door to a conversation?"" said Helen Tsui, a 49-year-old woman who marched with her husband.

"World News: Beijing Issues a Warning to Protesters --- Mainland official tells Hong Kong activists to beware, backs city's effort to stifle unrest","BEIJING -- China's top office for Hong Kong affairs signaled Beijing's waning patience with protesters in Hong Kong, warning them not to underestimate the strength of the central government and urging the local police to punish those who break the law.
Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council, reiterated Beijing's support for Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the city's police on Tuesday. Police and gangs of men clashed with protesters throughout the city on Monday, as the activists revived chants calling on Mrs. Lam to resign.
""Those who play with fire will perish by it,"" Mr. Yang said at a news conference. ""Don't ever misjudge the situation and mistake our restraint for weakness."" He said the city had been pushed into a dangerous abyss, echoing comments from Mrs. Lam who warned protesters Monday that they were entering ""very dangerous territory.""
Mr. Yang's remarks and those in state media were harsher than a week earlier when he focused on support for Hong Kong's police and authorities. Since then, protests have expanded and seen more violent clashes with police. On Monday, a strike paralyzed parts of the financial hub.
Mr. Yang's warning came as more than 10,000 mainland police officers held antiriot drills in Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong. Police with riot shields practiced on mock protesters -- firing tear gas, blocking blows from improvised weapons and extinguishing flaming wheelbarrows. The mock protesters held banners reminiscent of mainland labor protests demanding unpaid wages, but they were clad in black T-shirts and yellow hard hats -- the unofficial uniform of the Hong Kong protesters.
The Shenzhen police bureau wrote that the drills were held in preparation for China's 70th anniversary and would aid the country's political security and social stability.
Such a security drill is a signal from Beijing, and sending some police officers from Shenzhen is a feasible scenario if Hong Kong's police force requests it, said Bates Gill, a China specialist at Australia's Macquarie University.
China would be loath to use the People's Liberation Army and would likely prefer to use maneuvers in the ""gray zone,"" he said.
""There's no doubt that some people in Beijing are considering some options short of the PLA,"" Mr. Gill said.
By Tuesday, with the strike over, the city was seemingly back to normal, with flights, trains and traffic operating as usual. Late Tuesday, however, police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds who gathered around a police station in the Sham Shui Po district after a student was arrested earlier in the day.
The unrest in Hong Kong has escalated into a second crisis for Beijing, as it grapples with a trade conflict with the U.S. that has roiled global markets. The two issues have begun to bleed into one another, with some American lawmakers expressing concern over whether Hong Kong is autonomous enough to merit special trade status with the U.S.
Chinese officials have accused the U.S. of encouraging Hong Kong protesters to undermine the nation. State-run tabloid Global Times floated the idea on Monday that multinationals that don't appear to sufficiently support Beijing over the Hong Kong protests should suffer business consequences.
Mr. Yang called on Hong Kong's government and police to be firm, saying the central government would never allow the city to fall into a dangerous situation.
""They need to carry out their respective duties, enforce the law strictly and never be soft on violent violations of the law,"" he said.
A Hong Kong police spokesman said 148 people were arrested on Monday.
A key demand of protesters is the resignation of Mrs. Lam. During a press conference Monday she said she had no intention of stepping down.
Mr. Yang said on Tuesday that Mrs. Lam has Beijing's unswerving support and that any efforts to push her out of office would go nowhere.
Critics of the Hong Kong chief executive have questioned whether she is maintaining the city's autonomous administration or taking directions from Beijing.
""It's clear Beijing is running the show,"" said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy legislator.
A government spokeswoman cited Mrs. Lam's remarks Monday that the situation in Hong Kong was becoming unstable.
In recent days, Chinese state media have called for a harsher crackdown by Hong Kong authorities and said the central government wouldn't stand idly by. State-run China Daily said in an editorial on Sunday that Hong Kong authorities needed to move beyond ""kid-glove tactics.""

"Hong Kong's Banks Confront Lean Times --- Political turmoil, trade war and slow growth mark 'end of era of super profitability'","For years, Hong Kong has been one of the world's most profitable banking markets. That status is now under threat.
The city is a money-spinner for HSBC Holdings PLC, Standard Chartered PLC, Bank of China (Hong Kong) Ltd. and others, such as Bank of East Asia Ltd. and HSBC's local subsidiary, Hang Seng Bank Ltd. It is lucrative in part because Hong Kong is a major financial center, and handles a lot of business for mainland Chinese clients.
Banks' profit per employee last year was higher in Hong Kong than in any other market tracked by Citigroup analysts -- roughly double the U.S. figure.
But now Hong Kong's economy is shrinking, hit by the U.S.-China trade war, slowing Chinese growth and months of antigovernment protests. Earlier this month, the city's chief executive, Carrie Lam, said Hong Kong was in a ""technical recession,"" typically defined as at least two straight quarters of economic contraction.
A weaker economy is likely to mean more loans going sour and less credit demand from households and businesses.
Meanwhile, lending is becoming less profitable, as the city's currency peg with the U.S. dollar forces it to match interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
Lower interest rates typically reduce the margins banks earn, by narrowing the gap between the rates at which they lend and borrow. To make things worse, there is new competition from upstart online banks.
""It's the start of the end of an era of super profitability in Hong Kong,"" said Ronit Ghose, the Dubai-based global head of bank research at Citigroup.
Quarterly results this week -- from HSBC on Monday and Standard Chartered on Wednesday -- will give investors an early indication. The two are both listed on the London Stock Exchange as well as in Hong Kong.
For the third quarter, consensus forecasts compiled by HSBC point to an 11% drop in net profit from a year earlier, to US$3.47 billion. Expected credit losses and other credit-impairment charges are forecast to be up by nearly one-third, to $673 million.
One focus for HSBC watchers will be cost-cutting plans, said Gary Greenwood, a U.K.-based analyst at Shore Capital Group, since the bank has pledged to increase revenue faster than costs this year.
Now comes the virtual competition. The Hong Kong government this year granted eight licenses for online banks, which won't need physical branches.
Felix Lam, a portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said traditional banks' defense of market share could lower fee income and raise the cost of attracting new deposits.
Hang Seng, HSBC and Standard Chartered will feel the most pressure from stiffer competition in the retail market, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note to clients, since about half their Hong Kong earnings come from retail.
Shares of Hong Kong-focused banks have underperformed the broader Hong Kong market this year. HSBC trades at 0.91 times the forecast book value of its assets, according to FactSet, below a 10-year average of 1.05 times. Trading below book value can signal investor concerns about capital strength or future profitability.
Despite the low valuation, analysts and investors don't see the stock as a bargain. Refinitiv tallies analysts' recommendations on a five-point scale: 1 is a strong buy, 3 a hold and 5 a sell. HSBC is currently at 3.3, the most negative since 2002.

Investor Relief May Be Premature in Hong Kong,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam's unpopular extradition bill is a symptom of the city's political problem, not a cause. Investors are in for a shock if protesters aren't satisfied with its withdrawal.
Mrs. Lam has finally resolved to retire the bill that has sparked months of protests in the special administrative region of China. Stocks surged in response to the news, with the Hang Seng Index up nearly 4%, led by property developers. Wharf Real Estate Investment rose nearly 12%.
Hong Kong's financial markets now seem priced for mild disruption at worst -- even amid the clearest signs yet that the political crisis is spilling over into the local economy. A survey of private businesses published Wednesday suggested that the beginnings of a serious recession were under way in August. The IHS Markit Hong Kong PMI survey came in at 40.8, far below the neutral 50 level. The result is consistent with a contraction of roughly 4% to 4.5% in gross domestic product. Purchasing activity was at its lowest level in the 21-year history of the series.
Even before Wednesday's rally, Hong Kong's markets weren't priced for anything like a 4% drop in GDP. The FTSE Local Hong Kong, which comprises stocks that make at least 70% of their sales in the city, has yet to reach even a one-year low.
The 12-month forward price-to-book ratio for Hong Kong's mammoth real-estate developers is 0.68, barely below the 0.72 average the sector has recorded since 2012. Property prices aren't showing signs of stress, with values in July within a fraction of their historic highs.
The PMI series requires caution, having sent exaggerated signals before. Notably, the series logged its worst reading during the 2003 SARS epidemic. GDP ended up falling by 0.6% in the second quarter of that year from the same quarter of 2002 -- nothing like the crash the PMI number suggested.
But the miserable economic sentiment should make investors more cautious, particularly since there is no guarantee Mrs. Lam's pullback will resolve the crisis.
The withdrawal of the bill is no longer the sole demand of the protesters, nor perhaps even their primary focus. It is one of five demands that also include the withdrawal of the ""riot"" designation given to the June 12 protest, an independent commission into police handling of the protests and universal suffrage. Every additional weekend of disruption, escalation and the souring of trust in public institutions has made the situation more difficult to repair.
Of course, Mrs. Lam doesn't need to convince the protesters she has given them everything they want. Dimming their enthusiasm to the point the city can function on a day-to-day basis would be enough to revive the local economy.
Investors are behaving as if she has already done that. Their relief may prove premature.

World News: Hong Kong Protests Defy Control,"Protesters set fires and police deployed tear gas and a water cannon as tens of thousands of demonstrators took part in an illegal march in Hong Kong, showing that a raft of recent government measures hasn't quelled months of unrest in the city.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam in her annual policy address last Wednesday pledged to boost the supply of low-cost homes, offer mortgage assistance for first-time buyers and increase mass-transit fare subsidies, in a bid to sap momentum from the protest movement by improving people's livelihoods. That followed harsher measures such as invoking an emergency law to ban masks at rallies and a decision by subway operator MTR Corp. to end train service earlier than usual in the evenings.
Demonstrators who attended Sunday's march said they weren't satisfied with Mrs. Lam's response to the protests, which were sparked by a proposed extradition law that would have allowed people in Hong Kong to be tried in mainland China's more opaque legal system. Although the government has pledged to withdraw the law, the protests have broadened into a call for democratic overhauls, an independent inquiry into police conduct and amnesty for arrested demonstrators.
Mrs. Lam's speech ""has not really focused on the protest itself,"" a 26-year-old demonstrator who gave his name as Chris said on Sunday. ""The police had fired live rounds. The protesters had smashed many shops. The violence on each side is stimulating the other side.""
Recent protests in the semiautonomous Chinese city have appeared to be smaller than the peaceful mass rallies this year, but they have also turned violent. Some protesters have hurled Molotov cocktails and bricks toward police, smashed stores viewed as pro-Beijing and vandalized subway stations.
Sunday's march started peacefully. But a police station was soon vandalized and fires were seen at the entrance. Police, who were on the station's roof, responded by firing tear gas. Later, a police truck fired a water cannon on a major road and police in riot gear deployed to the streets. A mosque in Kowloon was hit with blue-dyed water from the cannon, which police said was an accident.
Police on Sunday said protesters also threw Molotov cocktails into multiple subway stations and broke into banks. Shops and public utilities were also damaged, police said.
Around 5:40 p.m., police said officers found a paper box with electrical cables in a street. Police then used a robot to detonate the object.
Last week, police refused to approve Sunday's march.
""To Hong Kong people, this already feels like a police state,"" said a 28-year-old demonstrator who gave his name as Ryan. ""That's dangerous. I think the protest is going to continue into 2020. If we fail, there will be more bad regulations getting passed.""
Although Mrs. Lam avoided further concessions to protesters in Wednesday's policy address, she signaled some flexibility on Sunday. On a local TV talk show, she didn't rule out having an independent inquiry into police conduct, one of the protesters' key demands. But she said she would only pursue that option if a report being prepared on the matter by a pre-existing police watchdog fails to quell public anger.

Stocks Start Quarter on Shaky Ground --- Global issues risk hurting indexes at a time when they post biggest gains of year,"The next three months should be the most wonderful time of the year for the stock market. It is when consumers spend the most, companies sell the most and the economy usually grows the most.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 typically notch their biggest gains in the fourth quarter, rising on average 2.77% and 2.47%, respectively, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The indexes are up more times in the fourth quarter than for any other period, climbing 66% and 73% of the time.
Yet it already seems as though hitting those numbers this year is going to be tough.
Stocks have slumped to start October, falling on two of the first three days of the month. The Dow industrials are off 2.3% this month, pushing the index into negative territory for the past 12 months. The index is still up 12% for 2019.
Geopolitical risks alone are enough to spook most investors: The president of the U.S. is the subject of an congressional impeachment inquiry. The U.K. is supposed to pull itself out of the European Union by Oct. 31, and it may lose its prime minister in the process. The Saudi Arabia-Iran conflict is roiling the Mideast. Then add the continuing unrest in Hong Kong, the protests that cropped up in Egypt, the political paralysis in Israel and the U.S.-China trade war.
""The stacking of risk is having a very tangible impact on geopolitics,"" said Reva Goujon, vice president of global analysis at the consulting firm Stratfor. These issues are affecting economies that are already dealing with demographic changes, urbanization and technology-led disruptions of the labor force.
""All of these issues are swirling together,"" she said.
The effects are starting to show. Global trade is at its weakest point since the last recession, and the global manufacturing sector is in a recession. Data on Tuesday showed a gauge of U.S. factory activity contracted for a second consecutive month in September, falling to its lowest level since June 2009.
Fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth in the U.S. is expected to be only about 1.8%, according to a Wall Street Journal survey of economists. That makes the Trump administration's goal of economic growth of 3% or better look increasingly remote.
Friday morning brings the September jobs report, the first major piece of data for the quarter. It will be closely parsed for signs of weakness spreading to the workforce.
Likewise, investors will review third-quarter earnings reports over the coming weeks for indications that the trade war is crimping corporate profits. Earnings of companies in the S&P 500 are expected to decline for a third consecutive quarter.
Investors are already moving into safer assets, rotating out of such growth stocks as Amazon.com Inc. and Netflix Inc. and into shares they consider undervalued in the financial and energy sectors.
Stocks struggled during last year's fourth quarter. The blue chips peaked in early October and then plunged nearly 20% into the year's end. Then, it was a hawkish Federal Reserve that worried the market.
Now investors are debating whether the central bank will lower interest rates for a third time this year.
The markets always face issues and problems, but this year's appear to be connected and building on one another.
""It's reaching a crescendo in all sorts of places,"" said Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes. ""It feels like this is the end of the cycle"" after the 2008 crisis.

World News: Hong Kong Protests Erupt Into Chaos --- Police fire tear gas in strongest response in weeks to expanding pro-democracy rallies,"HONG KONG -- Hong Kong police fired a barrage of tear-gas canisters at thousands of demonstrators late Sunday as public unrest stretched into a seventh weekend.
Antigovernment protesters came out in big numbers during the day and, as darkness fell, thousands began to occupy main thoroughfares and target official buildings. Several hundred demonstrators gathered outside the Chinese government's liaison office, defacing the national emblem with black paint and pelting the building with eggs, before being driven back along key business districts by police in riot gear and with dogs.
Clouds of tear gas later filled the air as police officers repeatedly fired volleys to clear streets of protesters who had blocked roads closer to the central business district.
The scenes were the most chaotic since demonstrators stormed the city's legislative building on July 1. They marked the strongest show of force by police in weeks, signaling diminishing official tolerance for the protests sparked by a proposed law that would allow people to be extradited to China.
The city is in the throes of its biggest political turmoil since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997, with protests still drawing massive crowds even after the government suspended the extradition bill. In recent weeks, protesters have also targeted other symbols of China's presence -- including a high-speed rail station that links the city to the mainland.
Officials in Beijing have tried to publicly keep their distance from the crisis as President Xi Jinping grapples with a bruising trade dispute with the U.S. and an economic slowdown.
""The defacing of China's symbol there is a significant protest against Chinese rule Hong Kong has never seen before,"" said Ho-Fung Hung, a political economy professor at Johns Hopkins University. ""Now what is ahead will be a long resistance that nothing short of serious political reform can tackle.""
The government condemned the protesters, saying they ""blatantly challenged the national sovereignty."" A spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council ""strongly condemned"" Sunday's events, which it called ""absolutely intolerable.""
""Such acts openly challenge the authority of the central government and touch the bottom line of the 'one country, two systems' principle,"" the spokesperson said, referring to Hong Kong's status allowing it more autonomy than the mainland.
The spokesperson said the office supported Hong Kong authorities taking all measures to ensure the safety of government agencies and to punish those who committed the crimes.
Organizers of Sunday's march said 430,000 took part in the demonstration, while police put the figure at 138,000.
The demonstrators are demanding a full withdrawal of the bill even though the city's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has pronounced it dead. Other demands include an inquiry into the use of force by police.
""We must continue showing the government that it needs to be accountable to the people,"" said Sandy Chan, a 29-year-old saleswoman who had taken the day off to join the protest. ""Protesting is the only way we can make our voices heard in the absence of democracy.""
The Hong Kong government is refusing to yield further, raising the specter of more clashes. Officials have ruled out making new concessions, a person familiar with the plans said, and gained confidence in the strategy after a pro-government rally on Saturday that organizers said was attended by more than 300,000 people.
That ""Safeguard HK"" rally condemned the use of violence by some protesters. Police said the rally was attended by 103,000 people at its peak.
Late Sunday, in the northwest district of Yuen Long, violence erupted as a large group of men in white shirts descended on the local subway station and used sticks to attack anyone they believed to be returning from the protests, as well as journalists.

"REVIEW --- Editor at Large: Hong Kong's Flickering Hopes --- The government's retreat in the face of massive protests was an unexpected win for the territory's people, but they are unlikely to prevail against Beijing in the long struggle to maintain their freedoms.","Last week, two days after one of the most violent protests in Hong Kong since China resumed control of the territory in 1997, Thomas, a 20-year-old medical student who declined to give his last name, was still helping to clean up and replenish supplies at an emergency medical station outside the headquarters of the territory's government.
He had spent the better part of a day ferrying wounded protesters from the streets to his first-aid tent nearby. In unprecedented scenes in this city once seen, somewhat patronizingly, as a pragmatic, orderly, business-oriented community with little time for politics, thousands of demonstrators -- mostly young, many of them equipped with little more than gas masks and umbrellas -- had taken to the streets. Thomas found himself treating internal injuries and blunt-object wounds inflicted by repeated baton rounds and tear-gas fusillades from the Hong Kong police.
But when I spoke to him, exhausted in the searing midsummer heat of tropical Hong Kong, he was ready for the next round of protests to defend the territory's jealously guarded but fragile freedoms. ""Protesting might not succeed, it's true,"" he told me. ""But if we don't protest, we will definitely not succeed.""
It is a sentiment that has echoed across centuries of democratic resistance. And although Hong Kong is home to just seven million people, the struggle that continues to play out on the city's streets has global resonance. While many in the West ponder their own politics and lament the supposed erosion of their freedoms, the people of Hong Kong are engaged in a real struggle for their human rights against the world's biggest authoritarian power.
The immediate target of the revolt is the Hong Kong government, led by the hapless chief executive, Carrie Lam. But everyone here knows the real fight is against the People's Republic of China. Beijing is being challenged not by a great military rival but by hundreds of thousands of students, doctors, factory workers, lawyers and civil servants, armed only with a seasoned defiance and a determination to defend their cherished liberties.
That they are unlikely to succeed in the end is not just the predictable denouement of the 1997 agreement returning Hong Kong to China. The fact is that, as an economic asset and gateway, the city now matters less to Beijing than ever before. Its prosperity may well be a sacrifice that President Xi Jinping is willing to make as he asserts the authority of the Communist Party ever more aggressively at home and abroad.
For now, at least, Hong Kong's rebels have the upper hand. Their resistance was rewarded when, three days after the violent clashes and less than a week after an estimated one million people -- one seventh of the city's population -- took to the streets, Ms. Lam announced a climb-down.
She would, she said, ""suspend"" her attempts to pass legislation through Hong Kong's legislative council that would have allowed China to extradite people in Hong Kong suspected of crimes. Later, Ms. Lam, who was appointed by the communist government in Beijing, issued an extraordinary televised apology. ""I personally have to shoulder much of the responsibility. This has led to controversies, disputes and anxieties in society,"" she said. ""For this, I offer my most sincere apology to all people of Hong Kong.""
The government had insisted that the extradition arrangement was necessary to ensure that Hong Kong didn't become a ""haven for fugitives"" and that the transfer of suspects to China would be permitted only after due judicial process. But people here, including thousands of lawyers, scoffed, warning that the measure would open the way for Beijing to have political opponents and critics of the communist government picked up and sent across the border, where they would be subject to China's capricious legal arrangements.
""This law would be a huge blow to Hong Kong,"" says Jeffrey Ngo, a leading member of the Demosisto group, which advocates for more freedom for the territory. ""The rule of law is essential to Hong Kong's character and its commercial viability.""
Few in Hong Kong are ready to declare victory in what some have termed ""the last battle"" for the territory's freedoms -- and its unusual status as a semi-independent enclave within the People's Republic. To veterans of the fight for democracy in Hong Kong, Ms. Lam's unexpected decision instead looked simply like a tactical retreat by China and its proxies, not a strategic victory in the long struggle for human rights.
""It's too soon to call this a turning point -- too soon to count our blessings,"" said Emily Lau, a former lawmaker who has been a persistent critic of China and its nominees for years.
The next day, hundreds of thousands of protesters again took to the streets, this time demanding the full withdrawal of the bill and Ms. Lam's resignation. More protests took place at the end of the week to keep the pressure on the government and to send a continuing signal to Beijing and the world.
When Britain agreed to hand Hong Kong over to China in 1997, Beijing committed to maintaining much of the territory's legal system and open culture. In recognition of Hong Kong's striking economic success over 150 years of British rule and its status as one of the world's major financial centers, the Communist Party leadership agreed to a most unusual arrangement. China's leader, Deng Xiaoping, enshrined the principle of ""One Country, Two Systems"": Hong Kong would be legally part of China, but it would be a ""special administrative region,"" largely free to make its own laws (outside of defense and foreign policy) and maintain its liberal system of governance, which includes freedom of speech, freedom of the press and, crucially, the rule of law and an independent judiciary.
There were plenty of skeptics at the outset. Sure enough, over the first 20 years of China's control, the character of the city has steadily changed. Chief executives of the territory have become steadily more complaisant to China's wishes, say critics.
A report in April by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons noted the erosion of liberties. ""We fear that Hong Kong is in reality moving towards 'One Country, One and a Half Systems,'"" the members of Parliament said after a review of the territory's political system. ""We also believe that the Chinese government's approach to Hong Kong is moving closer to 'One Country, One System' than it is to maintaining its treaty commitments under the Joint Declaration.""
The report went on to note in detail breaches of the right to freedom of expression, freedom of the press and media, freedom of assembly and association and academic freedom. It also noted the prevention of democratically elected representatives from taking their seats, extrajudicial abductions, violations of the rule of law, interference in business activities and clampdowns on political speech and human-rights defenders.
Some critics go further. ""It is more like One Country, 1.1 Systems,"" says Claudia Mo, convener of the pro-democracy bloc in Hong Kong's legislature. Or, as Thomas, the medical student, puts it, ""China's invisible hand is becoming steadily more visible.""
In 2016, for instance, several anti-Beijing lawmakers refused to take the prescribed oath of loyalty to the People's Republic, vowing instead to serve the people of Hong Kong, or deliberately flubbed the oath. Though duly elected, they were removed from office.
China has been blamed for spiriting people out of Hong Kong and onto the mainland for detention and torture. The local press, lively and garrulous in the past, has taken on a somewhat muted quality when reporting on subjects of high sensitivity to Beijing. Last year, a journalist for the Financial Times was denied a visa renewal and banned from re-entering Hong Kong for the crime of hosting an event with a local leader who has called for independence for the territory.
Five years ago, tens of thousands took to Hong Kong's streets in colorful demonstrations to demand an end to China's steady encroachment on their liberties. These were known as the Umbrella Movement protests, after the implements the marchers carried to ward off both the seasonal rains and the pepper spray used by the police. But that protest fizzled in what seemed like a possible indication of the ultimate acquiescence of Hong Kongers in their political reality.
So when the protests burst onto the streets this month, some were surprised at their ferocity. Mr. Ngo, of the Demosisto movement, says that much more was at stake this time. ""In 2014, people were fighting for greater democracy -- trying to get China to fulfill its promises,"" he said. ""In 2019, they are trying to preserve their existing freedoms.""
This was not the only time since Hong Kong's return to China in 1997 that street protests have forced the territory's government to back down. In 2003, the government's chief executive tried to introduce legislation that would have expanded the definition of treason under Hong Kong's constitution in ways that would have dramatically reduced freedom to criticize the Chinese government. Concerns among commercial interests -- especially the institutions that have made Hong Kong a major financial center -- helped to defeat the measure. Their objections may have been crucial this time as well.
""The risk of extradition [to China] could affect business people too. They're not apathetic,"" says Ms. Mo, the pro-democracy legislator. ""And if Hong Kong becomes just like any other Chinese city, it's not going to work for international business people.""
While the protesters are determined to fight this battle alone if necessary, they also retain a sliver of hope that the world beyond China might help them preserve their way of life in inhospitable circumstances.
On the streets near the government's offices, Alexandra Wong was bedecked in the British union flag -- on her T-shirt, on her umbrella, in her hand. In an irony that may not be lost on Beijing, which recovered Hong Kong as part of its pledge to reverse the ""century of humiliation"" under imperial intervention, she has fond recollections of Hong Kong's outside rulers. ""As a British colony, we were very happy because we could see the future and we could do what we want,"" she says. She isn't hopeful, given the distractions roiling the U.K. today, but she would like Britain again to stand firm with its former subjects.
One hears more optimism about the U.S. under President Donald Trump, given his administration's aggressive posture toward China. ""There's an opportunity here -- the U.S. could make the preservation of Hong Kong's freedoms part of its trade discussions with China,"" says Ms. Mo. ""U.S. investment here is not exactly tiny, and I hope Washington can find a way to take Hong Kong into account,"" she adds.
For now, the territory remains tense as people await the next move from the government and its shadow bosses in Beijing. Any immediate optimism is tempered by the realization that two powerful changes since Hong Kong's handover to China make it much less likely that the Communist Party's leaders will tolerate much latitude for this troublesome outpost in their own land.
The first shift is that Hong Kong's economic significance has dramatically diminished. In 1997, Hong Kong's output was, remarkably, 20% of China's GDP. Today, after two decades of rapid Chinese growth, it makes up less than 3%. Chinese financial institutions and other businesses have also become a major presence in the territory, making Hong Kong more dependent on the mainland. Still, if forced to choose, Beijing has always made clear that it would opt for China's territorial integrity over Hong Kong's prosperity. If that was true 20 years ago, it is even more so now.
The other big change is the rise of more authoritarian rule in China. Some democrats, in Hong Kong and elsewhere, once thought that the city's success as a thriving political territory under the rule of law, with freedoms taken for granted in the West, might be a kind of democratic wedge, an inspiration to the rest of China.
But since 2012, when Mr. Xi came to power, the Western conceit that China would become steadily freer has been demolished as China's new leader has reversed much of the political liberalization of his predecessors. ""Thinking [that] Hong Kong could help make China freer was part of the misconception that China was in any case headed in that direction,"" says Mr. Ngo.
So despite the tumultuous events of the past week and the success (for now) of the rebels, the odds for Hong Kong don't look good. It is hard to be hopeful about the territory's future. Yet it is equally impossible not to be inspired by the events of the past few weeks.
All along Harcourt Road, where many of the pitched battles between police and demonstrators took place last week, posters were pasted to lamp posts, depicting the famous ""Tank Man,"" a lone man confronting a column of tanks near Tiananmen Square in 1989. They bore the words: ""We are Hong Kongers with a conscience. We are not thugs without a conscience.""
""The Chinese government knows that Hong Kong is not Tiananmen Square -- what they did 30 years ago, they would not dare to do it here,"" says Ms. Lau, the former lawmaker. It is a characteristically defiant statement from a characteristically defiant people, the last flickering flame of resistance to a rising oppressor. For now, at least, it is also true.

World News: Leader Says She Didn't Offer to Quit,"Hong Kong's embattled chief executive, Carrie Lam, said she has never tendered her resignation to Beijing and is committed to leading the city out of its monthslong political crisis.
On Tuesday, Mrs. Lam said she was disappointed that details of a closed-door meeting with businesspeople last week were leaked to the media.
On Monday, Reuters reported that Mrs. Lam told attendees that her first choice would be to quit if she could. She added, according to a recording of the meeting released by Reuters, that she had limited room for political maneuvering to resolve the impasse in Hong Kong because the issue has been elevated to a national level with regards to sovereignty and security.
There is no expectation that the turmoil can end before the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1, Mrs. Lam said in the recording. It was unforgivable that she had caused such havoc, she said in the recording. On Tuesday, Mrs. Lam said she had ""shared some private, emotional feelings.""
The city is entering a fourth month of protests over a bill, proposed by Mrs. Lam, that would have allowed people to be extradited to China.

World News: Unrest Alters Life in Hong Kong --- Families share tips on handling tear gas and transit disruptions as clashes upset routines,"Claire Law tracks her daughter's location in Hong Kong using a map on the Snapchat app and messages her hourly. Paige Macgregor and her family have stopped taking the subway and buses. Hui Wan Fung and his wife are going out less.
More than two months of marches, demonstrations and sit-ins in one of Asia's most densely populated cities are forcing everyday people to change their routines and develop contingency plans to accommodate new risks of violent protests and police action.
Hong Kong traditionally has had a low crime rate, a highly efficient public transportation system and a vibrant night scene. Since early June, it has been racked by civil disturbances each weekend. What began as large-scale marches against a bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China has mutated into street battles and broader protester demands for democratic reforms. Police have fired tear gas liberally in residential neighborhoods, shopping districts and subway stations, disrupting businesses and at times injuring passersby.
On a Sunday evening last month, Pierre Papworth was waiting for his wife and daughter to return from a trip to mainland China when he received a frantic text message. The pair had emerged from a subway station in Causeway Bay, a busy shopping district near their home, and found themselves caught in a clash between protesters and police.
""My wife was terrified,"" said Mr. Papworth, a 47-year-old British citizen who works in the toy industry and has lived in Hong Kong for 17 years. He said the pair tried to stay close to the police, and his 10-year-old daughter dodged a hair dryer inadvertently flung in her direction.
They reached home safely after walking for 15 minutes. But since the incident, Mr. Papworth said he has mapped a route home avoiding the main thoroughfare where protesters have previously gathered.
The weekend protests have been peppered by weekday demonstrations and sit-ins that have delayed or disrupted commutes by keeping subway trains in stations and blocking roads. Protesters have shifted tactics in recent weeks, sometimes gathering in large numbers rapidly or regrouping in different parts of the city, confounding police and catching uninvolved citizens off guard.
Julie Magno, a 36-year-old mother of three who works at a tech startup, said she has been relying on co-workers to keep her apprised of which areas to avoid. She said they often send her WhatsApp messages with information they have translated from Chinese social-media posts and articles containing details about where protests could take place.
Earlier this week, when Ms. Magno learned about an airport sit-in, she contacted her 17-year-old daughter and asked her to stay away from a mall in Tung Chung, a neighborhood near their home that is also close to the airport.
Chester Chan, an investment banker at a Chinese company, said he has been leaving for work half an hour early in case he encounters delays during his 20-minute commute. He monitors news on television and his iPads, sometimes watching live feeds of protests from multiple channels concurrently.
Mr. Chan said he used to take his toddler to Hong Kong's Disneyland about once a month, but has stopped doing so even though the theme park has been less crowded since the protests began.
On Facebook, a Hong Kong parents group has been flooded with discussions. Individuals have shared advice for what people should do if they accidentally inhale tear gas, such as rinsing their eyes and faces with saline solutions and turning off air conditioners.
Ms. Law, a 46-year-old who lives with her husband and three children in Hong Kong's New Territories, said she keeps in close touch with her teenage daughter when she goes out at night.
""I'd message her every hour and she just sends a quick emoji back,"" said Ms. Law. She also monitors her daughter's whereabouts using a map on the Snapchat app.
Charlotte Yu, a 19-year-old college student, returned to Hong Kong on Wednesday from London, where she is studying. She said her parents told her not to go out in black or white clothing. Most protesters have been donning all-black, while white has become the color of choice for the pro-establishment camp after men in white T-shirts attacked people clad in black in a subway station last month.
Lavinia Kar and her 7-year-old son took part in a few of the earlier peaceful marches, but she now goes alone to legal protests. The 42-year-old said she tempers what she says in public about politics.
Hui Wan Fung, a 31-year-old Singaporean who works in public relations, said he and his wife have cut back on date nights. ""We cook at home more, and we catch up with friends less now,"" he said.
Mr. Papworth, the British national whose wife and daughter accidentally found themselves at a protest site last month, said his family has tried to stick with their usual routines, but they are vigilant about their surroundings.
Last Sunday, he took his daughter to meet ""Grandma Wong,"" an elderly woman who regularly shows up at protests waving a Union Jack flag. ""She's witnessing history in the making,"" he said of his daughter, who is a Hong Kong citizen, adding it is important for her to remember this period for years to come.

Hong Kong and the Truth About China,"'Tell the truth about China!"" has become a rallying cry for protesters in Hong Kong. It is exactly what demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square were saying 30 years ago, before many of today's protesters were born. The truth is that for all China's economic advances, it remains a brutal, dehumanizing tyranny in which the ruling Communist Party would rather destroy people than give them a genuine say in their government.
I was in Beijing in 1989. I witnessed the Tiananmen uprising and during the long night of June 3-4 saw soldiers of the People's Liberation Army open fire on their countrymen. By dawn, Tiananmen Square had been cleared of the protesters who had occupied it for weeks. Tanks had supplanted their Goddess of Democracy statue.
I also spent weeks in Hong Kong this summer reporting on its protests, and I found the parallels chilling. Yes, Hong Kong is a different place in a different time under different circumstances. But in vital respects it is the same showdown. China's dictatorship is once again losing control of a major city to people whose rallying cry is freedom. Rather than give in to their legitimate demands, the Communist Party is readying its guns.
Whatever comes next, the millions of protesters in Hong Kong have been doing the world a heroic service. Like their predecessors at Tiananmen, they are exposing on a world stage the brutality of the Beijing regime. From the only place under China's flag where there is any chance to speak out, they are shouting the truth, day and night, in the streets and from the windows -- while they still can.
During more than 13 straight weeks of protest, Hong Kong's people have demanded the rights and freedoms -- including free elections -- that China, in a treaty with Britain, guaranteed to Hong Kong for 50 years after the 1997 handover. At a press conference last week held by Hong Kong's Civil Human Rights Front, which has organized some of the biggest peaceful protests, spokeswoman Bonnie Leung observed that if the authorities would simply keep those promises, ""the whole movement will end immediately.""
Instead, President Xi Jinping and his puppet, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, have defaulted to threats, propaganda and force. Ms. Lam's administration has deployed riot police, tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons. Officers have made more than 1,000 arrests. China has been pressuring Hong Kong companies, including Cathay Pacific Airways, to fire employees who join the protests. Chanting ""Stand with Hong Kong! Fight for freedom!"" the protesters have refused to back down. Some told me they are ready to die for their cause. Many of their predecessors did in Tiananmen.
Hong Kong police have begun firing warning shots with live ammunition. This weekend, police were caught on video beating unarmed civilians bloody on the subway. China has been conspicuously drilling troops of its People's Armed Police across the border, and last week it sent fresh army troops to its garrison in Hong Kong, labeling this a routine rotation to ensure ""prosperity and stability.""
China itself is the only threat to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. These protests began with a bill that would have allowed extradition to the mainland. Hong Kongers saw that such a law would expose them to a Chinese Communist Party that uses law as an instrument of dictatorship, not justice. In June, to oppose the bill, they held the biggest protests Hong Kong had ever seen; first one million strong, then two million.
Ms. Lam suspended the bill but has refused public demands to withdraw it outright. Without free elections, Hong Kong's people have no institutional recourse. In 2014 China imposed a rigged system in which Beijing, not Hong Kong, effectively ""elects"" Hong Kong's chief executive, who works with a similarly rigged pro-Beijing majority in the Legislative Council. Hong Kongers have no way to rid themselves of Ms. Lam, and no way to oppose her -- or her bosses in Beijing -- except by speaking up and taking to the streets.
The repeated showdowns, which China could easily have avoided, have turned a thriving hub of world commerce into a protest zone. Business is stricken. Peaceful protesters in huge numbers march week after week through heat and rain. Violent protesters attack the sites and symbols of authority.
The authorities surround their offices with huge, water-filled plastic bulwarks. From these fortresses they ratchet up the fear and coercion. In Beijing that's considered patriotic. Under Mr. Xi, Chinese communism is completing its evolution into a more economically efficient totalitarian system of techno-surveillance, brainwashing and the engineering of human behavior via a digital system of ""social credit,"" backed up by security squads, guns and detention camps. For Mr. Xi, who two years ago had himself installed as president for life, that constitutes ""modernization.""
With great courage and at intensifying risk, Hong Kong's people have brought to the fore a lesson for anyone dealing with China. For this regime, which aspires to world dominance, what matters most isn't economic development or international treaties, never mind freedom or democracy. As in Tiananmen, the prime imperative is absolute power, whatever it takes.

World News: China Detains British Trade Aide --- Hong Kong citizen never returned from Aug. 8 trip across the border in Shenzhen,"HONG KONG -- Simon Cheng, an employee of the British Consulate in Hong Kong, texted his girlfriend at a border check late on Aug. 8 to say he was almost home from a conference in the neighboring Chinese city of Shenzhen.
He never arrived.
Mr. Cheng's girlfriend on Tuesday said she has since learned from a lawyer his family hired in China that the trade-and-investment officer with the British Consulate General's office had been detained by Chinese border police and transferred back to Shenzhen, adding she didn't know why or where.
The U.K.'s Foreign Office said it was extremely concerned by reports that a member of its team had been detained and was seeking further information from Chinese authorities.
The consular employee had been worried about crossing the border after reading reports of increased controls because of the long-running antigovernment protests in Hong Kong, his girlfriend said in an interview.
She said that as far as she knew, Mr. Cheng hadn't taken part in any street protests and that -- aware of reports that Chinese border guards were more thoroughly checking some travelers' phones and bags -- he had deleted communication apps from his phone before entering Shenzhen that day and reinstalled them in Shenzhen.
Mr. Cheng, a Hong Kong citizen, was being held under administrative detention, which signifies a breach of rules rather than criminal activity, the man's girlfriend said she had been told by immigration authorities in Hong Kong and Mr. Cheng's Chinese lawyer. An administrative offense, such as violating immigration regulations, means he can be held up to 15 days without charge.
It isn't known whether the disappearance of Mr. Cheng, which was earlier reported by Hong Kong media outlet HK01, is related to the protests. But his disappearance without official explanation underscores the opacity of China's legal system, an issue that lies at the center of opposition protests in Hong Kong against a proposed law allowing people to be extradited to mainland China.
Hong Kong, a former British colony that was handed back to China in 1997, has been rocked by 11 weeks of demonstrations against Beijing's increasing encroachment. Chinese officials have condemned the protests and exchanged barbs with British counterparts who have supported the rights of Hong Kongers to stage peaceful rallies.
U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, on Aug. 9 to raise concerns and to express support for the right to peaceful protest. The next day, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said it was wrong for Mr. Raab to directly call Mrs. Lam, adding that China urged the U.K. to ""stop its interference in China's internal affairs.""
On his Facebook page, Mr. Cheng has a photo of himself dated June 9 stamped with the words ""opposed to the law amendment, revoke the evil law"" and calling for a march. His girlfriend said he was in London that day. Mr. Cheng's page also has posts on his attendance at trade-and-investment events.
The Guangzhou Railway Police, which has jurisdiction over the Chinese side of the railway station where Mr. Cheng was last seen, declined to comment.
Mr. Cheng's last message to his girlfriend, sent twice, said ""Pray for me,"" to which she replied, ""It'll be fine.""
""Every Hong Kong person would be nervous going through that border now,"" she said.

World News: Hong Kong to Invoke Emergency Powers --- City plans steps to ban protesters from wearing masks and quell street violence,"HONG KONG -- Authorities here are planning to invoke a British colonial-era law for the first time in half a century to ban people from wearing masks at protests, people familiar with the matter said, as police struggle to contain spiraling violent unrest.
The emergency law gives the government sweeping powers, but for now the city's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, is proposing limiting the measures to outlawing gas and other masks that have become a fixture of protests, a person familiar with the plan said. The law allows authorities to impose curfews, censor media, and take control of ports and all transport. Such measures aren't yet being considered, the person said.
Mrs. Lam called a special meeting of her executive council to propose the ban, which, if agreed, would become law on Friday. The measure is almost certain to be approved as the cabinet comprises mostly pro-government figures.
Police and pro-Beijing groups ramped up calls to use the law after the city was rocked by its worst day of violence in more than 50 years during China's National Day celebrations on Tuesday. Protesters and riot police clashed in more than a dozen districts, leaving more than 100 injured, including an 18-year-old protester shot by a police officer.
The shooting brought people back into the streets to condemn the city's police force Wednesday evening, targeting subway stations. Police were mostly absent from the streets until about midnight. Pockets of protests erupted late Thursday in many districts, with police firing tear gas to disperse people in one residential area.
The government is planning to invoke the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, first introduced in 1922, to ""end the violence and restore law and order to the streets,"" one of the people familiar with the plan said. It would be the first time it has been used since the British colonial government invoked it in 1967 to suppress riots during China's Cultural Revolution.
Officials have been reluctant to use the powers, which some advisers have warned could steepen economic decline by appearing to undermine the rule of law that underlies the city's position as a financial center and safe base for foreign businesses.
""Invoking this archaic law will only make the situation worse,"" said Alvin Yeung, a pro-democracy lawmaker and barrister in Hong Kong. ""This will not solve the turmoil -- peace can only come if there is a political solution.""
Mrs. Lam last month pledged to withdraw an extradition bill that triggered mass street protests in early June. The law would have allowed people to be sent for trial in China, which has a less independent justice system and where human-rights violations are common. But the withdrawal hasn't lessened unrest. Protesters have four other demands, including a judge-led independent inquiry into alleged police brutality, pardons for those arrested at rallies and greater democracy.
Some foreign diplomats expressed doubts over the mask ban, saying it could be impractical to implement and backfire by further angering residents. ""Enforcement could be an issue,"" a diplomat said, adding that such a proposal underscores that the Hong Kong government doesn't have many options.
Countries including Canada and France and more than a dozen U.S. states have some form of antimask legislation. Last year, police in Georgia invoked an antimask law passed in the 1950s to arrest antiracism protesters. North Dakota passed an antimask law in 2017 in response to protests over an oil pipeline. A federal version called the ""Unmasking Antifa Act"" was introduced in Congress last year but failed to make it out of committee.
Police in Hong Kong have increasingly refused to approve rallies, but demonstrators have taken to the streets almost daily, with crowds of tens of thousands most weekends. The gatherings often end in battles between police and front-line protesters, who wear gas masks to protect themselves from bombardment with tear gas. Many other protesters wear surgical masks to hide their faces. Some have started to wear Guy Fawkes masks seen at other protests around the world.
Surgical masks have been worn in Hong Kong offices, streets and subways to prevent the spread of germs since the SARS epidemic killed hundreds in the city in 2003.
The law ""affects our freedom of doing what we want to do and protecting ourselves,"" said a 22-year-old student protester. ""Someone will take photos of our faces -- it may be a mainland supporter, a police officer or a journalist from pro-China media.""
Tsang Chi-kin, the student who was shot on Tuesday -- while wearing a gas mask -- was charged Thursday with rioting and attacking a police officer. He was shot as he and others swung bars at the officer.
Mr. Tsang, who remains hospitalized after undergoing emergency surgery, was represented by a lawyer during a court hearing.
Tuesday saw the city's most violent unrest since the 1967 anti-British riots, with police firing around 1,400 rounds of tear gas, 900 rubber bullets, 190 beanbags, 230 sponge rounds and six live bullets in fighting the day before. More than 120 people were injured and 269 arrested -- the highest daily totals so far in nearly four months of conflict.
The city's influential Junior Police Officers' Association called Wednesday for officials to adopt emergency laws to enable officers to better respond to protests. Officers were targeted by groups with metal bars and corrosive liquids, police chiefs said.
The association suggested a curfew law could be imposed in some places. The government considers a curfew unworkable in the city of seven million, a person familiar with the plan said.

World News: Hong Kong Opposition Activists Are Arrested,"HONG KONG -- Police arrested three prominent opposition activists as authorities clamped down on dissent ahead of an anticipated 13th weekend of protests in the city.
Joshua Wong, a leading pro-democracy campaigner who is secretary-general of the youth political group Demosisto, was taken into custody Friday morning on his way to a subway station near his home, Demosisto said. Police pushed the 22-year-old Mr. Wong into a private car on the street and he was taken to the city's police headquarters, Demosisto said.
Another prominent Demosisto figure, Agnes Chow, was arrested separately at her home, the group said. The police can hold people for up to 48 hours without charging them.
The Hong Kong Police Force said Mr. Wong is suspected of inciting others to participate in unauthorized assembly, organizing an unauthorized assembly and participating in an unauthorized assembly.
It said Ms. Chow is suspected of inciting others to participate in unauthorized assembly and participating in an unauthorized assembly.
Andy Chan, the leader of the banned pro-independence Hong Kong National Party, said on Facebook late Thursday that he was about to be detained at the airport while trying to board a flight to Japan.
On Friday morning, police said they arrested a 29-year-old man surnamed Chan at the airport for participating in a ""riot"" and for assaulting a police officer. The Organized Crime and Triad Bureau was investigating, it said.
Renewed clashes between protesters and police are expected over the weekend after the city's police force banned a planned mass rally and march planned for Saturday, citing fears of violence. Protests in recent weeks have descended into confrontation and clashes. Protesters began circulating online notices soon after the ban, saying they would demonstrate anyway.
Mr. Wong, an icon of the pro-democracy movement, has said previously that while he understands the use of more radical means to protest given the lack of concessions during this summer's protests, he doesn't advocate or practice violence.

Hong Kong's Young Dissidents: Schoolchildren Fuel Protests --- A new type of front line emerges in classrooms and playgrounds,"HONG KONG -- Before the 8 a.m. bell rings at high schools across the city, uniformed students at some of them gather to join hands, chanting protest slogans or singing ""the revolution of our times,"" words from a popular protest anthem.
Hong Kong officials had expressed hope the city's biggest protest movement in decades would begin to subside when classes resumed in September.
Instead, violence between demonstrators and police has intensified, producing some of the bloodiest days since the protests began in June -- and schools have become a driver of the city's uprising against China's ruling party.
This week, clashes paralyzed Hong Kong, disrupting commutes and shutting down schools. Violence escalated Thursday when protesters at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University shot arrows at policemen, who responded with volleys of tear gas. Chinese President Xi Jinping, speaking at a summit in Brazil Thursday, blamed protesters for the violence and urged a tough police response.
Confrontations between protesters and police have turned university campuses into battle zones. Clashes at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and other universities prompted hundreds of mainland Chinese students to flee. The action on college campuses is bolstered by protesters not yet old enough to attend; high school students are turning up at the forefront of battles throughout the city.
Young people drive protest movements across the globe, but the extreme youthfulness of Hong Kong's protests has alarmed Chinese and local officials. Though college campuses have been the scenes of violent confrontations, the fight is rapidly spreading into high schools, where a new type of front line is emerging.
High schools serve as natural points of contact for protesters to find like-minded supporters, organize and plan. They have also become venues for dispute between student protesters and students who support mainland China's rule. Teachers say that even as they try to mediate arguments on playgrounds and classrooms, they are under scrutiny, too, and fear losing their careers if they are seen as advocating protests.
Local pro-Beijing figures have urged school heads to expel student protesters charged with rioting. Last month, the city's education chiefs asked school principals to report children who wear face masks to school in defiance of a recent ban.
Chinese officials have demanded that education officials punish teachers who advocate protests against Chinese rule. On Tuesday, Chinese state media announced that Beijing had published new education guidelines that included the goal to build a stronger national identity for students in Hong Kong and Macau.
More than a third of 4,000 protesters arrested are age 20 and younger, according to police records. Among those, dozens are 14 or younger. The youngest protester arrested is 11.
Last month, two teens -- one of them 14 years old -- were shot by police during street battles. Both survived and the older teenager was charged with rioting, an offense that carries a prison term of up to 10 years. A high school student was charged with wounding a police officer with intent for allegedly jabbing a boxcutter into his neck. Recently, a 13-year-old arrested on the subway was carrying two unlit Molotov cocktails.
""This is the most important fight of our generation,"" said Adam, a high school senior who turned 17 in October, and who estimates that about 60 out of 400 students in his Hong Kong high school actively support the protests. ""We can't back down now, no matter what the teachers say or how they try to stop us.""
Adam, who did not want to be identified by his full name for fear of repercussions, says he suspects teachers called the police on him when he and a classmate chanted protest slogans outside his high school asking classmates to join him in a school boycott as a way to support the protests. He said police officers searched students on the playground after teachers called them to break up a protest. School officials did not respond to calls seeking comment.
Zack Ho, 18, heads the Hong Kong Student Strike Alliance, which advises high school students on organizing protest events at schools and how to deal with opposition from teachers and principals.
At his own high school he said he had met resistance from schools officials and push back from mainland Chinese students.
His principal rejected his idea to set up a wall for people to post sticky notes of support for the movement. The principal also told him she won't allow protest events in school over fears that it would increase tensions with mainland students at the school. The school principal declined to comment.
Mr. Ho found workarounds. While walking between classes, he shouted pro-democracy slogans. In response one day, a mainland Chinese classmate threw a piece of paper with a hammer and sickle drawn on it. ""I support the Chinese government. Long live China!"" Mr. Ho said the boy shouted.
Lau Pak-ho, a high school junior, said he was cut out of his class photo for boycotting classes in support of protests. The 17-year-old high school junior, said his school issued a notice to parents to warn against students taking part in class boycotts. The school said anyone who took part would be excluded from class photos, said Pak-ho, who boycotted anyway, with around 40 classmates.
Across the city, more than 390 high schools have formed ""concern groups"" to organize protests, according to Samson Yuen, assistant professor of political science at Hong Kong's Lingnan University.
More than a third of arrested protesters were born after China reclaimed Hong Kong from Britain in 1997, according to police records.
In a June survey of more than 1,000 Hong Kong residents age 19 to 29, 2.7% of respondents said they identify as Chinese.
In the same survey two months before the Beijing Olympics in 2008, 29% of Hong Kong residents in that age group said they identified as Chinese.
Kyle Chan, a vice principal at Marymount Secondary School, has allowed students at the prestigious girls' school to engage in peaceful protest. On a recent morning, the vice principal stood watching as 100 uniformed students joined hands outside the school gates and chanted protest slogans.
""We're sensitive to the different opinions, especially because those supporting the movement are more vocal,"" Mr. Chan said. ""This experience has taught the students about the importance of critical thinking.""
So far, two Hong Kong secondary school teachers have received warning letters from education officials over alleged social media posts that suggested violence against police officers and their families amid public anger of how officers have handled the protests.
""Teachers serve as students' role models through teaching by words and examples,"" Hong Kong's education bureau said. ""It is heart-breaking to see students getting injured, breaking the law or being arrested.""
Some academics who support the ideals of the protest movement said as the protests grow more destructive, they fear the youngest protesters are easily manipulated into riskier actions.
Steve, a high school English teacher, said fears of losing his job prompted him to delete Facebook posts in which he expressed his views supporting the protests. He said he no longer feels comfortable openly discussing current news events in class. Officials at his school, however, have allowed students to chant slogans in favor of protests at school assemblies.
In his homeroom, in which about a third of students are from mainland China, students are divided, he said. When he showed a news clip in class that included protests and a Chinese national flag thrown into a river, some students shouted ""dirty cops"" while mainland students sat silently.
Concerned that Beijing's scrutiny of secondary schools might make him a target, Steve changed his Facebook profile name and picture.
Click by click, he deleted posts in which he objected to police use of force against protesters and criticisms of China's ruling party. He unfriended students.
Beijing blames the school system for failing to inculcate Hong Kong's youth with a sense of Chinese national identity. Some Chinese officials claim teachers are helping foment the protest movement.
""Some educators use their power and resources to spread the seeds of violence and hatred,"" said Xu Luying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese government's office responsible for Hong Kong. Teachers who encourage students to boycott school or engage in protests ""should be severely punished.""
Tin Fong-chak, the vice president of Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union, said he ""felt deeply wronged"" and that Beijing's comments about teachers ""are only excuses"" for poor governance of Hong Kong.
Pro-Beijing figures point to a liberal studies curriculum -- akin to social studies in the U.S. -- made mandatory by local officials a decade ago.
Some of the subjects included in the curriculum would be off-limits in mainland Chinese schools, including civil disobedience.
Teachers have leeway to choose study materials and often incorporate current events into lesson plans.
Many Hong Kong teachers say they may raise the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre as a routine part of the course work. Some said they are now less willing to incorporate discussions on current protests, fearing they could lose their jobs.
""The class encourages the teaching of half-truths,"" said Regina Ip, a government adviser. ""We need to be teaching our children China's rich history. How can kids themselves identify as being part of China if they have no knowledge of the country?""
Educators fear a renewed attempt to push Chinese patriotic education, which promotes Communist Party ideology. Local officials tried to bring in such a course in 2012, only to shelve plans after 10 days of street protests led by teachers and students.
Adam, the 17-year-old student, says he boycotted class a few times in September. He's asked his teachers to allow him to form a concern group on campus, but was rejected.
On Sept. 30, as students called for a citywide student boycott, his school held an assembly to raise the Chinese flag in celebration of the following day's 70th anniversary of the founding of Communist China.
Some classmates ran into the hall, singing their own protest anthem. He and a few others stood outside the campus, chanting protest slogans.
After two hours of chanting, and refusing orders from a school administrator to go back to class, a group of police arrived at the sidewalk outside the school and told the group they were suspected of illegal assembly, Adam said.
The officers searched the students' pockets and bags, but left without taking any action, he said.
Adam and other teenage protesters say they are driven by a desire to install young lawmakers -- many of whom were removed from office or prevented from running.
""That's all I want to see: someone in government who will listen to me and fight for me, not for some distant government far away in the north in Beijing,"" he said. ""Who else can we entrust our own futures to?""
