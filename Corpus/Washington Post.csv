"On the Web, Facebook and Twitter adopt policing role","Social media giants say China manipulated 
Hong Kong conversation
Social media companies increasingly have embraced a role they once shunned, as online police penalizing those crossing certain bright lines: You can lie on their platforms but not be ""inauthentic."" You can twist reality but not in a ""coordinated"" way.
But even these few bright lines came under new pressure Tuesday as China - home to the world's largest population and the second-largest economy - mounted a rare public defense of what Twitter and Facebook deemed coordinated, inauthentic behavior aimed at manipulating online conversation. A Foreign Ministry spokesman dismissed the allegations, made by the companies a day earlier, that the government had done something wrong in using online resources to portray the protests roiling Hong Kong as the work of ""cockroaches"" spurred to action by shadowy Western forces.
Rather, ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said, the accounts were not the work of alleged government disinformation teams but of Chinese students and others living overseas who ""of course have the right to express their point of view.""
The move underscored the awkward and largely uncharted territory the companies have attempted to navigate in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election in the United States, where Facebook and Twitter faced furious public and political pressure to stem the tide of disinformation on their platforms. Once vehemently opposed to being seen as ""arbiters of truth,"" both have since built major operations to detect and dismantle forms of online manipulation - even if it means angering important global actors such as the Chinese government.
The emerging global debate over these efforts echoes one in the United States as President Trump and many conservatives say social media companies are acting too aggressively in blocking accounts that they regard as violating their rules for authentic discourse online, portraying such efforts as censorship of political speech. Trump held a White House summit last month highlighting these complaints.
In China, the scale and sophistication of the disinformation effort was not particularly notable, but the decision by the companies to accuse a powerful government as responsible - something companies once shied away from - was seen as an indicator of increasing assertiveness by Silicon Valley.
Twitter on Monday shut down nearly 1,000 active accounts that it said were part of the operation and roughly 200,000 it said were created to help the effort. Facebook closed five accounts, seven pages and three groups on its platform it depicted as fake.
Their actions generated significant praise among the disinformation research community and politicians who have championed the cause of more transparent online discussion. The comparative silence of Google, the owner of YouTube and a company with concrete ambitions of working in China, sparked criticism.
The costs for Twitter and Facebook and their long-term plans to rid their platforms of disinformation remained unclear. Facebook at one point was so eager to impress the Chinese, where the platform is mostly blocked to users, that chief executive Mark Zuckerberg learned enough Mandarin to give a 20-minute speech in Beijing in 2015.
""It would be a tough call to make for anybody to call out China in an influence operation,"" said Ben Nimmo, chief of investigations for Graphika, a network analysis firm based in New York that studies online disinformation.
Facebook and Twitter declined to respond to Geng's comments Tuesday. Twitter said that it will no longer accept advertising from state-controlled media entities, but that those accounts ""will be free to continue to use Twitter to engage in public conversation."" Facebook said it is reviewing its rules for state-owned media.
As U.S.-based companies attempt to manage online discourse globally, there is no international consensus over what qualifies as permissible speech - or permissible tactics in spreading that speech, whether it comes from government operatives or anybody else.
The moves by Facebook and Twitter could set up a major geopolitical clash over how much influence nations can exert on the ways information spreads across the Web.
China has enjoyed virtually unassailable control on social media within its borders, employing systems of strict censorship and surveillance against online topics conflicting with the government's self-asserted ambitions, image and power.
But the social media giants' response suggests that the country has attempted similar information-manipulation tactics around the world, probably to boost its international support and undermine protests in Hong Kong.
""The Chinese government has built an entire infrastructure to support its efforts at information control, through a combination of censorship and disinformation,"" Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) said in a statement. ""And it's exporting both the technology and ideas information control to authoritarian regimes around the world.""
The fake posts pushed Chinese propaganda efforts and characterized the protesters as terrorists and cockroaches. Some profiles were disguised as normal Americans in Nevada, Ohio and Texas; one account, which framed itself as a Trump-supporting ""Catholic Defender of the Constitution,"" had more than 181,000 followers.
Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, said, ""China has undertaken information operations that, much like their foreign policy, have been much more subtle and discreet . . . and this is neither subtle nor discreet.""
Daniel Sinclair, an independent social media researcher in New York who tracks Chinese influence, says the country's attempts to steer online debate in the West seem to have grown recently, possibly amid anxieties over how the nation is being perceived amid a U.S. trade war and the Hong Kong unrest.
""This Chinese nationalism that is spreading across American and Western social media, much of it isn't true disinformation as we understand it, but a lot of it is backed by actual state propaganda and fake news,"" Sinclair said. ""I don't think we've ever seen their media machine working at this scale. . . . With social media, China has new kinds of influence, and new fingers in the Western media, that they haven't had before.""
Twitter and Facebook are not widely available in China, but they are in Hong Kong. Silicon Valley for years has sought to expand its limited footprint in the world's most populous nation, with mixed success, as Chinese companies have become major domestic and global players in social media and other areas of advanced technology.
For some researchers, the moves have also cast a harsh spotlight on the lone social media giant that has yet to offer comment: Google, whose YouTube has been similarly criticized for its use in the spread of political misinformation.
Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) called Twitter's takedown announcement ""a good start,"" and he urged Google and its counterparts to end projects with China and ""refocus their efforts on researching and tracking disinformation campaigns from hostile state actors.""
Google's move to phase out an artificial-intelligence contract with the U.S. military, following the company's past work toward building a search engine that could gain approval from the Chinese government, has drawn rebukes from federal lawmakers. Google has a research partnership with a Beijing university, but it said its development on the search-engine project has been terminated. 
""Two of the three relevant companies have made public statements,"" said Alex Stamos, a former security chief at Facebook who now works as an adjunct professor at Stanford University, in tweets late Monday.
For social media companies to attribute attacks to governments, ""it's a lot harder when the actor is financially critical,"" he added. 
Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Arson at Japanese animation studio leaves 33 dead,"Man is in custody after Kyoto blaze, one of the nation's worst in decades
TOKYO - Employees at a building owned by Kyoto Animation, one of Japan's premier anime production houses, were in the middle of the work morning Thursday in their sleepy suburb when a man entered the building.
Moments later, he began to spray a flammable liquid around the office, police said.
As he did so, he screamed at the startled employees: ""Die!""
Then came the inferno. The flames spilled out through the windows, charring the outside of the building. Smoke rolled through the corridors and stairwells. The workers made a frantic - and futile - attempt to escape. Some collapsed as they ran upstairs in a desperate bid to reach the building's roof.
Firefighters wrestled for hours with the blaze. In the end, at least 33 people were confirmed dead in the apparent arson attack, according to the Kyoto City fire department, with many more injured. Authorities said injuries ranged from serious to critical.
It was the worst death toll in Japan from fire since a Tokyo office building blaze claimed 44 lives in 2001.Though a 41-year-old suspect is now in police custody, the motive behind the startling attack on an animation house remains unclear and largely incomprehensible. The incident has shaken Japan, a country where mass violence remains relatively rare and animated production is a national obsession.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe described it as an ""arson and murder case"" in a message on Twitter. ""It's so tragic that I am at a loss for words,"" he wrote.
Founded in 1981, Kyoto Animation is one of the country's most important producers of anime, a Japanese-style of animated art that often features vibrant graphics and fantastical storytelling.
Though the company initially worked in support of more famous studios like Tokyo's Studio Ghibli, in recent years Kyoto Animation's own anime productions have garnered international acclaim.
Notable titles include ""Full Metal Panic!,"" ""K-On!"" and ""Sound! Euphonium.""
The tragedy that struck Kyoto Animation on Thursday took place at the company's No. 1 studio, a three-story office building on the outskirts of Kyoto.
The building, humble and built of yellow brick, is where Kyoto Animation's main line production takes place, according to Anime News Network.
Emergency services said that the fire broke out at around 10:30 a.m. At the time, there were roughly 70 people inside the building.
The fire that the man started appears to have set off secondary explosions. Video footage showed smoke billowing from the complex as rescue workers rushed to the scene.
Inside, panicked workers attempted to escape the blaze by running to the building's large, flat roof. Fire officials said many did not make it, and victims were found on the top floor and on staircases that would have led them to safety.
Locals who were nearby ran to the building with a ladder to try to reach people on upper levels, according to Japanese media reports.
It took firefighters about five hours to contain the blaze, the Kyodo news agency reported. In addition to the 33 confirmed dead, another 36 were injured and hospitalized.
For those in the anime world, the fire brought shock and despair. Kyoto Animation had been known not just for the quality of its work but also the kindness with which it treated its staff - an oddity in an industry where long hours and low pay are the norm.
""Kyoto Animation are a rarity in the anime business: they treat their people well, they strive to own part of their works, and their creations are consistently excellent, at the very least on a technical level,"" Mike Toole, an editor at large for the Anime News Network wrote on Twitter.
The company was founded by a husband-and-wife team and employed more women than most anime production houses. Mikihide Daikoku of the Kyoto City fire department said that 20 of the 33 people who died in the blaze were women.
Hideaki Hatta, co-founder and president of the company, told reporters after the fire that the studio had been receiving threats.
""We have received protests against our company - not a few of them, if not on a daily basis. There were murder emails, including those which said 'die,' "" he told broadcaster NHK.
An unnamed 61-year-old woman told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper that she had opened the front door of her home after the intercom rang and found a large man kneeling on the ground, covered in flames and burns.
Believing the man to be a victim, she doused the man with water and called an ambulance. But police officers surrounded him and began to ask questions - and then took him into custody.
""They ripped me off,"" she recalled him saying, the Asahi Shimbun reported.

"Spat between Japan, S. Korea extends to Olympic cuisine","Tokyo says Seoul's fears of radiation in food are groundless
TOKYO - The specter of radioactive sushi on menus at the Tokyo Olympics is a new front in an increasingly vindictive spat between South Korea and Japan, two U.S. allies that can't seem to get along.
With tensions between the neighbors the highest in decades, South Korea's delegation to Japan's 2020 Games raised concerns last week about radiation at Olympic venues near the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant and the risk that athletes might consume contaminated food.
The protest formed part of a three-pronged attack that suggested South Korea is using the tsunami-induced 2011 nuclear meltdown as another stick with which to poke Japan. The two sides' dispute over trade and compensation for wartime forced labor escalated Thursday when Seoul scrapped a bilateral military intelligence-sharing pact.
On Monday, South Korea said it had summoned a Japanese diplomat to express concerns about the possibility that treated radioactive groundwater stored at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant might someday be released into the ocean - although Japan says the meeting came at its request. A day later, South Korea's Olympics delegation raised worries about radiation at an international meeting with Tokyo Games organizers, while on Wednesday, Seoul's Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said it would double the radiation testing of some Japanese food imports because of contamination fears. 
The Korean Sport and Olympic Committee has operated separate cafeterias for its athletes at past Olympics and is considering expanding that operation in Japan due to concerns about food safety, spokeswoman Lee Mi-jin said. 
In doing so, Seoul has struck at what it knows is a tender spot. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has set great personal store in a successful Olympics and wants to use the Games as a symbol of hope and recovery after the Fukushima disaster.
Six Olympic softball games and a baseball game will be held in Fukushima, the prefecture's capital city. The Olympic torch relay will start from there, too.
Japan's government says the fears are groundless, with Foreign Minister Taro Kono saying he had ""thoroughly explained"" the safety of Japanese foods based on scientific evidence when he met his counterparts from South Korea and China on Wednesday.

Radiation levels in Fukushima city are comparable with safe readings in Hong Kong and Seoul, while Tokyo's readings are even lower, in line with Paris and London, government data shows. Food from the region is tested intensively for safety.The radiation cloud generated by explosions at the Fukushima reactors spread over thousands of square miles of northern Japan, causing 165,000 people to flee their homes. But officials have been engaged in a massive cleanup since, removing or treating swaths of topsoil to remove radioactive cesium and prevent it from entering vegetation.
Tokyo has stringent limits on the amount of cesium allowed in food, setting a maximum of just one-twelfth the levels permitted in the United States or the European Union. Agriculture and fish testing centers in Fukushima prefecture have analyzed hundreds of thousands of food samples from the danger zone, as well as samples of every ocean catch.
With the exception of a handful of samples of wild mushrooms and freshwater fish, and one skate caught in the ocean in January, none of the samples has exceeded radiation limits in the past three years, officials say. 
Although exports of agriculture, forestry and fisheries products from Fukushima have recovered beyond pre-disaster levels, at least 24 countries and territories ban some produce from Fukushima, while Taiwan, South Korea and China maintain a total ban on food from the prefecture.
In April, South Korea won the bulk of an appeal at the World Trade Organization supporting its right to ban and test seafood from Japan, although the judgment was based on WTO rules rather than the levels of contaminants in Japanese food or what the right level of consumer protection should be.
In justifying its move to step up testing, Seoul's Food Ministry said trace amounts of radiation were detected in about 20 tons out of more than 200,000 tons of total food imports from Japan over the past five years, although its statement noted levels below even Japan's strict limit of 100 becquerels per kilogram.South Korea's qualms about contaminated food at the Olympics fell on deaf ears, according to Japanese media reports, with the organizers saying thorough inspections of Olympic sites had already been carried out and other countries failing to support South Korea's position.
That's not to say there are no grounds for concern about a million tons of treated radioactive groundwater stored at the nuclear power plant, environmental groups say.
This month, Tokyo Electric Power Co., or Tepco, said the tanks at the site would be full by the summer of 2022, as fresh groundwater continues to seep in and become contaminated.
That announcement raised concerns that Tepco may push ahead with a proposal to dilute the treated water and gradually release it into the ocean.
Although many scientists say it is safe to release properly treated water, public trust is low, with Tepco forced to acknowledge last year that the treatment system had so far failed to remove dangerous radioactive elements, including strontium-90.
Local fishermen also oppose releasing the water, arguing such a move would destroy public confidence in marine produce from Fukushima. Japan says no decision has been reached.

Ironically, rice from Fukushima was on the menu at a working lunch during the Group of 20 meeting in Japan in June attended by South Korean President Moon Jae-in. But Moon left before the rice was served, the presidential office in Seoul said Friday.

The NBA's air ball,"NATIONAL BASKETBALL Association
players and the league's commissioner, Adam Silver,
have a well-earned
reputation
for candor about politics and
social matters
. Last year, Mr. Silver
told
CNN
that the ""sense of an obligation, social responsibility, a desire to speak up directly about issues that are important"" is ""part of being an NBA player."" Taking note of a certain meekness in other corporate suites, he said, ""I think in this day and age, you really do have to stand for something.""

It was entirely consistent with this ideal that the general manager of the Houston Rockets, Daryl Morey, posted an image on Twitter on Friday night that included support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests: ""Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong."" Though Mr. Morey soon deleted it, the tweet quickly angered
China's Communist rulers. They have been struggling to squelch the Hong Kong protestors, who want China to honor its commitments for democracy and rule of law in that semi-autonomous territory. The Chinese Consulate in Houston declared it was ""deeply shocked by the erroneous comments"" and demanded the team ""correct the error and take immediate concrete measures to eliminate the adverse impact."" 
Pathetically, the league immediately capitulated, essentially importing to the United States China's denial of free speech. It apologized to China, saying Mr. Morey's tweet was ""regrettable""; a Chinese- language version called it ""inappropriate."" The team owner rushed to disavow Mr. Morey's support for democracy, tweeting that Mr. Morey ""does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets."" Mr. Morey issued a groveling reconsideration that would have been welcome in a Communist Party criticism/self-criticism session.
Of course, a lot of money is at stake. The Chinese Basketball Association immediately suspended relations with the Houston Rockets. Sponsors began pulling back from deals. Tencent, the Chinese digital rights holder for NBA broadcasts, dropped the team from streaming. The NBA is big business in China, where 500 million people watched games last season, according to the Associated Press, and where a new streaming deal alone will generate $1.5 billion for the league over the next five years.
But that's the point. China is attempting to enforce its version of the truth all around the world - bullying Chinese-language newspapers in Canada and the United States, patrolling the speech of its students abroad, demanding that foreign airlines and hotel chains wipe Taiwan off their maps. Some of its targets don't have the wherewithal to stand up to this assault - which is why the NBA's cravenness is so damaging. With all its financial muscle, its enormous popularity and its moral preening, if the NBA can cave so easily, who will resist the censorship of the Communist dictators?
Those dictators will say, as usual, that Mr. Morey's tweet offended the ""Chinese people."" But because the Chinese people themselves are not free to speak out - since anyone in China expressing support for the Hong Kong movement is also punished - those claims should not be taken seriously. And if Mr. Silver really believes that ""you really do have to stand for something"" - what will it be, if not freedom of expression in Hong Kong, in Houston and around the world?"
U.S. advances sale of jets to Taiwan,"The Trump administration is pressing ahead with an $8 billion sale of new F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, a move likely to raise strong objections from China amid the deepening trade dispute between Washington and Beijing.
The State Department submitted the package to Congress for informal review late Thursday, and it is not expected to meet opposition, according to several U.S. officials and other people familiar with the matter. It would be the largest and most significant sale of weaponry to Taiwan in decades.
The deal has been in the works for months, and lawmakers from both political parties had questioned whether the White House would scuttle it with hopes of softening the ground for a U.S.-China trade pact or otherwise seek to use the jets as a bargaining chip in the deadlocked negotiations.
Neither the White House nor the State Department responded to requests for comment. 
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, hailed the move in a statement Friday, calling it ""an important step in support of Taiwan's self-defense efforts.""
Likewise, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.) and ranking Republican Michael McCaul (Tex.) said in a statement that the sale ""sends a strong message about the U.S. commitment to security and democracy in the Indo-Pacific.""
The Chinese Embassy did not respond to a request for comment, but Beijing has repeatedly expressed its hostility to such deals.
""China's position to firmly oppose arms sales to Taiwan is consistent and clear,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in March, after press reports that the Trump administration had tacitly approved the sale. ""We have made stern representations to the U.S. We have urged the U.S. to fully recognize the sensitivity of this issue and the harm it will cause.""
Taiwan split from China in 1949 and set up a rival government in Taipei. Beijing continues to view the self-governing island as a renegade state that will one day return to China. To prevent an outbreak of hostilities that would draw in the United States, every president since Richard Nixon has acknowledged the Chinese position that Taiwan is part of China, but continues to have unofficial relations with Taiwan. 

Some experts said that advancing the arms sale now, amid stalled trade talks and pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, will exacerbate the already fraught U.S.-China relationship. They also fear that the sale could result in China imposing sanctions on U.S. defense companies that sell arms to Taiwan and do business in China.
""Taiwan's defense is intrinsically important to the United States, but the timing of this move, amid the trade war and major instability in Hong Kong, is exceptionally precarious,"" said Evan Medeiros, former White House senior director for Asia in the Obama administration and a professor at Georgetown University. ""It will make trade negotiations and managing the Hong Kong situation even harder than it already is.""
He added that it would also fuel conspiracy theories that the United States is behind the unrest in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous part of China. Observers fear that China could launch a military crackdown there. Such a crackdown could embolden Beijing to confront Taiwan.
China last month accused the United States of a ""vain plot"" to arm the island after the Trump administration approved a $2.2 billion sale of Abrams tanks and Stinger surface-to-air missiles and allowed Taiwan's leader to visit New York. 
Taiwan requested 66 American-made fighter jets. The United States has not sold new fighter jets to Taiwan since 1992. This month, the congressional delegation from South Carolina, which includes Senate Foreign Relations Committee member Lindsey O. Graham (R), sent a letter to the president urging him to support the sale. The lawmakers said the deal would be ""critical"" to sustaining thousands of jobs in their state. 
Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, played down the risk of a Chinese overreaction to the advancing arms deal. ""China never likes U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. Will they object? Yes. Is this going to trigger a crisis in the relationship? No. This in and of itself is not going to derail progress on a trade agreement.""
She said the new aircraft would be comparable in capability to F-16 jet upgrades approved by the Obama administration. ""This is not a new capability,"" she said. 
Eric Sayers, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and a former aide to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who before his death last year led the powerful Armed Services Committee, credited the administration with ""returning to a normalized process where arms sales to Taiwan are considered individually instead of packaged into large bundles and delayed for years.""
However, he said, the enormous price tag will put the onus on Taiwan to grow its $12 billion defense budget to sustain key spending on training and personnel.
Other experts have questioned the operational utility of fighter jets for Taiwan, given its relatively small defense budget compared with Beijing's, and have argued that the money would be better spent on asymmetric defense capabilities, such as missiles, mines and air-defense weapons.
Both Medeiros and Glaser noted Beijing's previous threats to sanction U.S. companies that sell arms to Taiwan. Though China has not acted in the past, Glaser said, ""there is some possibility that they will follow through on their threat this time."" 
The Chinese government accused the Trump administration of ""playing the 'Taiwan card' "" last month when Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen visited New York.
Trump took the unusual step of speaking by phone with Tsai in 2016 when he was president-elect, alarming China. Since then he has courted a warm relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping and said little about Taiwan.
Tsai faces reelection next year and is casting her leadership as a counterpoint to an increasingly repressive and assertive mainland China. This has endeared her to Trump administration officials who are hawkish on China, but Trump's own views are unclear.

WSJ reporter covered Xi's family. Then China banned him.,"BEIJING - China effectively expelled a Wall Street Journal reporter from the country, one month after the newspaper published a report detailing allegations that a cousin of Chinese leader Xi Jinping was involved in high-stakes gambling and potential money laundering in Australia.

Chinese authorities told the Journal on Friday that press credentials would not be renewed for Chun Han Wong, a Singapore national who has covered Chinese politics out of the paper's Beijing bureau since 2014. Those credentials expired Friday. 
China sometimes withholds or refuses visas to punish international news organizations for what the ruling Communist Party perceives as unfavorable coverage. But the decision amounted to the first time that the Chinese government has effectively banned a reporter from the Journal, a publication generally known for incisive but evenhanded coverage of the country.
Wong was one of two authors of a July 30 report disclosing a far-reaching Australian law enforcement and intelligence probe into Ming Chai, one of Xi's cousins and an Australian citizen. The report, citing Australian officials and casino documents, detailed Chai's lavish spending in resorts owned by the gambling mogul James Packer, and Chai's links to what Australian officials deemed to be a money-laundering front in Melbourne.
The story noted there were no indications Xi knew about his cousin's activities in Australia or that the Chinese leader was implicated in any wrongdoing. Still, Beijing considers the private wealth of top leaders' families to be the most sensitive and taboo reporting subject of all, given the chasm between the Communist Party's ideological rhetoric and the vast, often hidden wealth accrued by elite families since the party turned toward state capitalism in the 1980s.
""We can confirm that Chinese authorities have declined to renew Chun Han's press credentials. We continue to look into the matter,"" a spokesman for Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, said in a statement to The Washington Post.
https://twitter.com/fccchina/status/1167407904711823361?s=21"">
China's Foreign Ministry, in a faxed statement, said the Chinese government handled affairs concerning foreign news organizations and correspondents in accordance with the country's laws.
""We firmly oppose that a few foreign reporters are maliciously tarnishing China, and we don't welcome such reporters,"" it said.
The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China said in a statement that Wong was the sixth journalist to leave the country under such circumstances since 2013 and condemned the move ""in the strongest possible terms.""
Under Xi's hard-line rule, China has significantly tightened the domestic space for speech and dissent while aggressively ramping up overseas propaganda. Facebook and Twitter this month said they would remove nearly 1,000 state-backed accounts that were spreading disinformation globally about the anti-government protests in Hong Kong. 
After the Journal published the story following a joint investigation with Australian media, the Chinese Foreign Ministry denounced the reporting as ""groundless accusations based on rumors"" and an attempt to smear China.Wong left the mainland Friday night for Hong Kong.

James's remarks denounced,"Politicians and protesters
blast criticism of Morey
over Hong Kong tweet

LOS ANGELES - LeBron James added another chapter to the NBA's ongoing China controversy Monday by taking issue with Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey's decision to post a message on Twitter in support of Hong Kong, and the four-time MVP drew criticism from U.S. politicians and Hong Kong protesters.
In his first comments since the Los Angeles Lakers returned from playing two exhibition games in China, James told reporters at Staples Center that Morey was ""misinformed or not really educated"" when he posted a graphic Oct. 4 that read ""Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong."" The tweet was met with immediate anger from Chinese authorities, and the conflict deepened when both Morey and the NBA refused to issue a formal apology.
""I don't want to get into a . . . feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand and he spoke,"" James said before the Lakers hosted the Golden State Warriors in a preseason game. ""So many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually. Just be careful what we tweet, what we say and what we do. Yes, we have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negatives that come with that as well. . . . Sometimes social media is not always the proper way to go about things as well.""
James, who has been an advocate of professional athletes expressing their political opinions, said he personally did not feel sufficiently informed about the Hong Kong protests to discuss them in detail last week. He added that the situation in China was ""very delicate [and] very sensitive"" and that he appreciated NBA Commissioner Adam Silver meeting with the players in China to discuss the unfolding controversy, which included numerous events being canceled and led Chinese broadcasters and sponsors to quickly cut ties with the Rockets.
""I'm not here to judge how the league handled the situation,"" James said. ""When you're misinformed or not educated about something, and I'm just talking about the tweet itself, you never know the ramifications that can happen. We can all see what that did, for our league and for all of us in America and people in China as well. Sometimes you have to think through things that may cause harm not only for yourself but for the majority of people. . . . It was a tough situation for Adam as well, having to put out such a fire that he didn't create and he didn't start.""
James is the second NBA superstar to make headlines for commenting on the Morey situation and the second to draw criticism.
Rockets guard James Harden publicly apologized in the wake of the backlash to Morey's comment, sparking accusations that he was siding with his Chinese business interests rather than American ideals, such as free expression. Similarly, James was criticized for questioning Morey's thought process while at the same time refusing to offer commentary on Hong Kong.
""Clearly [James] is the one who isn't educated on the situation at hand,"" Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) wrote on Twitter. ""It's sad to see him join the chorus kowtowing to Communist China and putting profits over human rights for Hong Kong. I was there two weeks ago. They're fighting for freedom and the autonomy they were promised.""
Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) added: ""This kind of garbage is hard to take. . . . News flash: people are being harmed - shot, beaten, gassed - right now in Hong Kong. By China. By the Communist Party the NBA is so eager to appease.""
In a pair of tweets posted Monday night, James sought to quell the negative reaction by asserting that he was not commenting about the political substance of Morey's tweet.
""Let me clear up the confusion,"" he wrote. ""I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I'm not discussing the substance. Others can talk about that. My team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it.""
Morey's initial Twitter post came shortly before the Rockets played two exhibitions against the Toronto Raptors in Japan and the Lakers faced the Brooklyn Nets twice in China. The contests were part of the NBA's annual preseason pilgrimage overseas, which has included games in China since 2004.
James, who has repeatedly visited China for the 2008 Olympics, various NBA events and to market his Nike sneakers, had nothing but positive things to say about his experiences in the country.
""I've always been welcomed with open arms,"" he said. ""I've been to China over 15 or 20 times. The main reason I've always wanted to go back to China is the game of basketball. The game of basketball has brought people together, in so many different facets, different countries, different people. . . . That's what I'll continue to do because this sport has done so much for me.""
The reception was much different from a few hundred fans gathered Tuesday night at a basketball court west of central Hong Kong for a protest in support of Morey's tweet, one of several protests planned this week in the city. Many were in masks, and some wore basketball jerseys of their favorite teams - the Lakers, Raptors and Boston Celtics.
Some directed anger at James and expressed dismay that the NBA - known for taking a stand on causes in the United States such as police brutality - would not do the same for Hong Kong.
""It is so hurtful to us that [James], the face of the NBA, would speak up for freedom of speech in America while dismissing Hong Kong, when we are suffering every weekend,"" said James Lo, a 30-year-old who attended the rally in a Lakers jersey. ""I know it is about business. I know that China has 1.4 billion and we are just 7 million. But the NBA should be protecting their values, not their money.""
Lo added that the episode has only proved what Hong Kong is up against and how China's business influence can ""control speech all over the world.""
The Lakers spent much of their China trip in limbo, waiting to find out whether Chinese authorities would cancel their games. They ultimately proceeded as scheduled, but the NBA nixed its usual media access periods, meaning James and his teammates did not comment on the controversy while overseas.
""All we kept saying is, 'S---, we flew all these miles to come over to China; we would love to play the game of basketball in front of these fans,' "" James said. ""We were just hoping that the game wouldn't get canceled because we wanted to play.""

China says it won't take Trump's tariffs lying down,"Threat to retaliate addsto trade war and fearsof global recession
China announced Thursday that it would be forced to take ""necessary countermeasures"" if President Trump moves forward with tariffs set to take effect Sept. 1, continuing the back-and-forth escalation of the trade war even as the conflict elevates fears of a global economic slowdown.
Earlier this week, in a rare moment of easing, Trump announced that tariffs on certain consumer goods would be postponed until mid-December to spare consumers and companies some of the added costs during the holiday shopping season. It marked Trump's first public acknowledgment that Americans shoulder the burden from his tariffs, although in tweets Trump also said the move ""actually helps China more than us"" and claimed China would reciprocate.
But the Chinese response Thursday showed that Beijing was not appeased by the delay.
""The move by the U.S. seriously violated the consensus reached between the two heads of state in Argentina and Osaka, and deviates from the right track of resolving differences through consultation,"" the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council said in a statement. ""China will have to take necessary countermeasures.""
Markets around the world slumped after China's announcement. In the United States, stocks vacillated between gains and losses, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising about 100 points, or 0.4 percent, by the closing bell.
""Every time investors find the strength to pick themselves up off the floor, the trade war delivers another blow and knocks them down again,"" Craig Erlam, an analyst with OANDA, wrote in a note to investors Thursday. ""This report also answers the question of whether China viewed the decision to delay half of the tariff hikes until mid-December as being conciliatory in any way or just an act of self-preservation, given the importance of the holiday season in the U.S.""
Chinese officials offered no further details as to what form countermeasures might take, or whether their trade negotiators would still be coming to the U.S. to continue talks in September. But the message shows China is prepared to dig its heels in, even as it grapples with political protests in Hong Kong and a raft of disappointing economic data. Earlier this week, China reported levels of high unemployment, as factory output fell to a 17-year low, showing the breadth of the nation's economic slowdown.
In the United States, similar omens are looming. For the first time since the run-up to the Great Recession, the returns on short-term U.S. bonds eclipsed those of long-term bonds. This phenomenon, which suggests investor faith in the economy is faltering, has preceded every recession in the past 50 years.
""The stars are aligned across the curve that the economy is headed for a big fall,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. ""The yield curves are all crying timber that a recession is almost a reality, and investors are tripping over themselves to get out of the way.""
The panic caused the Dow Jones industrial average to shed about 800 points Wednesday, in its biggest single-day drop of 2019. 
Stocks bounced around most of Thursday, a reflection of investor uncertainty over the competing issues of China trade, the global bond market and an expanding U.S. economy.
By the end of the day, not much had changed from the session's start. There was some help from a robust report on July retail sales from the Commerce Department. The Labor Department also reported that U.S. productivity rose 2.3 percent in the second quarter.
The Dow and Standard & Poor's 500 index both settled slightly to the upside but were far from clawing back Wednesday's losses. Shares of retail giant Walmart spearheaded the blue chips, rising 6.11 percent on a better-than- expected earnings report. The S&P finished up the day at 2,847, a gain of 7 points, or 0.25 percent. The Nasdaq composite was the only down note, but it was still close to break-even at 7,766, a loss of less than 0.1 percent.
The president took to Twitter to blame the media for its reporting on the worsening world economy.
""Walmart, a great indicator as to how the U.S. is doing, just released outstanding numbers. Our Country, unlike others, is doing great! Don't let the Fake News convince you otherwise,"" Trump tweeted.
Simeon Hyman, global investment strategist at ProShares, said the stock market's middling mood is a reflection of the ""tug of war"" between a strong American economy and ""the rest of the world, which is not as healthy as the U.S. Those trade tensions with China are not going away.""
Signs of the trade war's toll are surfacing not just in the United States and China but all over the globe. Central bank leaders in Europe, Asia and Australia have announced interest rate cuts in recent weeks, attributing the need for economic stimulus to the fallout from the trade war. And on Wednesday, Germany announced that its export-driven economy had shrunk 0.1 percent between April and June, and officials blamed the drop-off on the fallout from the trade war and the looming threat of a no-deal Brexit. With another contraction this quarter, Germany would officially be in a recession.

Markets sink on recession signal,"Stocks have their worst day of year
Bond market, European woes, trade war stir fears
Recession signals intensified Wednesday in the United States and in some of the world's leading economies, as the damage from acrimonious trade wars is becoming increasingly apparent on multiple continents.
The U.S. stock market tumbled to its worst day of the year on Wednesday, after a reliable predictor of looming recessions flashed for the first time since the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 800 points, or 3 percent, and has lost close to 7 percent over the past three weeks.
Two of the world's largest economies, Germany and the United Kingdom, appear to be contracting even as the latter forges ahead with plans to leave the European Union. Growth also has slowed in China, which is in a bitter trade feud with the United States. Meanwhile, Argentina's stock market fell nearly 50 percent this week after its incumbent president was defeated by a left-wing opponent in primary voting.
Whether the events presage an economic calamity or just an alarming spasm is unclear. But unlike during the Great Recession, global leaders are not working in unison to confront mounting problems and arrest the slowdown. Instead, they are increasingly at one another's throats.
And President Trump has responded by both claiming the economy is still thriving while dramatically ramping up his attacks on Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell, seeking to deflect blame.
Wednesday's sharp sell-off was caused by an unusual development in the bond market, called an ""inverted yield curve,"" that often foreshadows a recession.
For the first time since the run-up to the Great Recession, the yields - or returns - on short-term U.S. bonds eclipsed those of long-term bonds. Normally, the government needs to pay out higher rates to attract investors for its long-term bonds. But with so many losing confidence in the near-term prospects of the economy and rushing to buy longer-term bonds, the U.S. government now is paying more to attract buyers to its 2-year bond than its 10-year note.
This phenomenon has preceded every recession in the past 50 years.
""The stars are aligned across the curve that the economy is headed for a big fall,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. ""The yield curves are all crying timber that a recession is almost a reality, and investors are tripping over themselves to get out of the way.""
It's the latest in a string of worrisome news about the U.S. economy. The government is expected to spend roughly $1 trillion more than it brings in through revenue this year, adding to a ballooning deficit. Business investment has begun to contract - largely because of the uncertainty surrounding Trump's trade war - and manufacturing sector hiring has receded. The big hiring and investment announcements that piled up at the beginning of the Trump administration have ceased, as have the announcements of bonuses and pay increases that came after a tax cut law was passed in 2017.
Several White House officials have become concerned that the economy is weakening faster than expected, but they are not working on proactive plans to change its course. The Treasury Department has had an exodus of senior advisers in recent months, and the White House just announced a replacement for its chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
Instead of rolling out new policies, Trump and other top aides have escalated their attacks on the Federal Reserve, trying to pin much of the United States' problems on what Trump alleges are elevated interest rates that are strangling growth.
In Twitter posts on Wednesday, Trump appeared to be trying to calm investors while also unloading vicious language aimed at Powell, whom he nominated in late 2017.
""China is not our problem, though Hong Kong is not helping,"" Trump wrote. ""Our problem is with the Fed. Raised too much & too fast. Now too slow to cut . . . Spread is way too much as other countries say THANK YOU to clueless Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve. Germany, and many others, are playing the game! CRAZY INVERTED YIELD CURVE! We should easily be reaping big Rewards & Gains, but the Fed is holding us back. We will Win!""
The Twitter posts reflected a growing anxiety within the White House about problems in the economy, which many advisers believe will determine whether the president wins reelection. Just a few hours earlier, Trump offered a contradictory assessment, saying the inverted yield curve was a good sign because there was ""Tremendous amounts of money pouring into the United States. People want safety!""
In the past, Democrats and Republicans in control of the White House have scrambled when there were signs of an economic downturn, worried about the political fallout. They would meet and consult with Congress about ways to protect the economy or advance some kind of economic stimulus, either through tax cuts or spending increases.
But the Trump administration has already cut taxes and boosted spending, and there appears to be little political appetite to do more of either this year or next. White House officials have discussed a plan to make changes to the way capital gains taxes are levied, but that would only affect certain investors and already has faced criticism from Democrats as being a boon to the rich.
Complicating matters, a number of investors and foreign leaders have blamed Trump's trade war for causing the contraction in business investment and forcing companies to pull back, an accusation that has caught White House advisers off guard.
The U.S. economy has shown signs of weakening in recent months, but high levels of consumer spending in the United States have helped enormously. Still, the escalating trade war between Trump and Chinese leaders has stopped many businesses from investing. And there are signs that the large tariffs he has placed on many Chinese imports are costing U.S. businesses and consumers billions of dollars.
In a rare admission of the economic consequences of his adversarial trade approach, Trump on Tuesday announced he was delaying many of the tariffs he had promised on cellphones and laptop computers until Dec. 15. That announcement brought the stock market up sharply higher on Tuesday, but all of those gains evaporated in minutes Wednesday amid fears about the inverted yield curve.
""Just in case they might have an impact on people, what we've done is delayed it so they won't be relevant for the Christmas shopping season,"" Trump told reporters Tuesday.
It was the first time Trump has publicly acknowledged that American people and businesses bear some of the burden from his tariffs.
The delay offered a glimmer of hope in an otherwise grim outlook in U.S.-China trade policy and was announced after a phone call between trade negotiators, which Trump lauded as productive. Chinese officials are planning to come to the United States in September to continue talks.Darkening skies overseas gave investors more to worry about. New data indicated Germany was slipping into recession, with the country's economy shrinking 0.1 percent between April and June. If it experiences another contraction during this quarter, Germany officially would meet the definition of a recession. Officials blamed the drop-off on the U.S.-China trade war and the looming threat of a hard Brexit by Britain.
Argentina's stock market plummeted 48 percent on Monday and then fell further this week, after incumbent President Mauricio Macri was defeated by a left-wing rival by a surprisingly wide margin in primary voting.
Meanwhile, China is grappling with massive protests in Hong Kong, a key financial center in Asia. On Wednesday, China also reported more signs of a weakening economy, with factory output falling to a 17-year low and high unemployment. Many analysts said the country is feeling the consequences of the trade war with the United States.
""The big concern is around trade,"" said Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at Pimco. ""The longer we remain in limbo, the more damage to the global economy.""

Overreacting to the China challenge,"ASPEN, Colo.

Where is the United States heading in its confrontation with China, which moved this week from a trade dispute to a currency battle - with more dangerous tests in Hong Kong and Taiwan looming ominously in the background? 
Does the United States have a strategy in this cascading competition? Do America's military and diplomatic tools match the scope and subtlety of the challenges ahead? Is America's growing anxiety about Beijing creating a policy panic that overstates the Chinese threat and understates U.S. strength? 
This ""Battle for Primacy"" with China was the topic of this week's annual meeting of the Aspen Strategy Group, a group of former secretaries of state, national security advisers and other senior former and current officials, supplemented by some journalists and think-tank analysts, that has been gathering here since 1984. 
""The consensus of our meeting was that this is by far the greatest national-security challenge the U.S. faces for the next few decades,"" said Nicholas Burns, a Harvard professor and former undersecretary of state who serves as the group's director. The forum agreed that ""the foundation of our policy toward China has to be the internal strength of the United States,"" he said. 
Over the three days of discussion, I heard broad support for other specific themes: China has become a potent rival in military power, technology and economic clout, and President Trump was right to take a tougher line on Chinese trade practices than had his predecessors. But Trump's policy has been a changeable collection of tactics more than a systematic plan for dealing with China - it's ""an attitude more than a strategy,"" as one member of the group put it.
Trump's tariffs have produced an escalating tit-for-tat pattern that this week spread to currency, as China let the renminbi fall sharply and the United States responded by branding Beijing as a ""currency manipulator."" Former treasury secretary Lawrence H. Summers, not usually an alarmist, warned Monday in a tweet that ""We may well be at the most dangerous financial moment since the 2009 Financial Crisis.""

""The public anger and frustration toward China are there, but the policy and strategy are not,"" Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) told the group. Kevin Rudd, a former Australian prime minister, warned the American gathering: ""At present, you don't have a strategy. That's just a reality.""
What concerned the group was that Trump's economic jousting is taking place against a backdrop of potentially explosive security challenges - the growing citizen protests in Hong Kong and a January election in a Taiwan that Beijing sees as a rebellious province. These two political battles carry a risk of Chinese military intervention for which the United States isn't well prepared. 
Philip Zelikow, a former State Department official who teaches at the University of Virginia, warned that he sees ""a one-in-three chance of major crisis over Taiwan in the next year or so."" The group pondered how the United States should react to a Chinese intervention, however unlikely. 
U.S. military options would be risky in a Taiwan crisis. In more than a dozen war games over the past decade, news reports have said the imaginary U.S. side has lost. ""The force we have isn't going to win,"" cautioned Chris Brose, former staff director of the Senate Armed Services Committee. In a confrontation across the Taiwan Strait, warned another former senior official, ""a carrier task force won't last one minute, Okinawa will be a place for soldiers to die.""
The group agreed that the United States must prepare for a long, difficult period of competition with a China that can no longer be regarded as a benign partner. ""Friction is the new normal,"" said David Shambaugh, a China scholar who teaches at George Washington University.

But as the discussion progressed, group members increasingly stressed that it was important for the United States not to overreact, in Taiwan or elsewhere, and to remember America's abiding strengths - if it can solve its current political problems.
The Aspen conversation wasn't a call to arms against China, but rather a call to prudent national security policy. China is gaining weight in the seesaw of power, said Harvard professor Graham Allison, but the United States retains the balance if it keeps faith with allies such as Japan and Europe and brings them to the competition. 
Rudd summed up the need for clear American strategy in this contest: ""It's 50-50 how it turns out,"" he told the group. ""It depends on what you do - and your confidence in yourselves."" It's a long game, one that requires the most precious and scarce resources in today's America - patience, unity and resolve.

"Hit by tear gas and blue dye, Hong Kong protesters again defy police ban","HONG KONG - Riot police, tear gas and water cannons spraying stinging blue dye sent protesters fleeing Sunday following another massive, unauthorized but initially peaceful march through Hong Kong as authorities intensified their efforts to quash the unrest that has gripped the city for months.
Chants of ""five demands, not one less"" rang through the streets of central Hong Kong in the early afternoon as tens of thousands of demonstrators again defied a police ban to stage a large march through the city. Some demonstrators appealed to their former colonial ruler, Britain, and the United States to support their demands for democracy.
Tensions began escalating before sundown, when police fired rounds of tear gas to clear protesters who were occupying a key road. Masked groups in black retaliated by lobbing molotov cocktails and smoke bombs at police barricades outside government buildings, briefly setting them ablaze. Protesters also tore up bricks from the surrounding streets and hurled them at the buildings. 
At night, clashes broke out between police supporters and the anti-government protesters in the eastern part of Hong Kong Island.

It was the 15th weekend of large demonstrations in the Chinese territory. Despite an intensifying police crackdown, limited concessions from the Hong Kong government and the sheer exhaustion of many protesters, the unrest shows no signs of abating as a sensitive political anniversary for China - the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party on Oct. 1 - draws closer. 
Protesters at one point tore up a banner celebrating the anniversary and set it on fire. Elsewhere, protesters unfurled a banner of their own: ""Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.""
""We are doing everything we can to fight, and yet we cannot see a victory for ourselves or even a future,"" said a 35-year-old who helped hang the banner from a flyover. He asked to be identified only by his last name, Ho, for fear of arrest over his participation in the illegal march.
""Of course I am afraid to be arrested with every march I attend,"" he said. ""But there is no alternative to standing up for ourselves.""
The protests were sparked by a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China. But they have since grown in scope and ambition, reviving a long-held aspiration for universal suffrage and the direct election of Hong Kong leaders.
Focus has shifted to the conduct of the Hong Kong police. Many have called for an independent investigation into their use of force against the protesters; the government has rejected the demand.Demonstrations over the past months have underscored how Beijing has lost support among Hong Kong's youths and even older groups - contrary to expectations during the 1997 handover.
Demonstrators have been appealing to Western nations for help while denouncing the mainland as an oppressive force akin to the Nazis.
A few hundred demonstrators gathered outside the British Consulate on Sunday, singing ""God Save the Queen"" and demanding that London do more to protect the former colony. Britain is a signatory to an agreement that allows Hong Kong to keep its unique status and relative freedoms from mainland China until 2047, 50 years after the handover.
Some in Hong Kong hold British National Overseas passports, granted before the handover. This document allows easy travel to Britain but does not give the holder legal residence or work rights. Some are calling on London to strengthen protections for this group. 
The march Sunday afternoon swelled to tens of thousands moving through the streets of central Hong Kong, shutting down major roads and highways in scenes now familiar. Protesters early in the afternoon started dismantling metal railings and gearing up with gas masks and hard hats in anticipation of confrontation with riot police. 
Some again vandalized entrances to subway stations, a source of protester fury over perceptions that the rail operator is conspiring with the government to stymie the rallies.
Protesters broke glass panels and dumped trash down the entrance to Admiralty, the station closest to government buildings and Harcourt Road, a normally busy road that they once again occupied until routed by police. They also set fire to the entrance of Wan Chai, a nearby subway stop. 
Police warned protesters repeatedly that they were participating in an ""unauthorized assembly"" and ordered them to ""stop their illegal acts immediately."" Police said they deployed tear gas and ""specialized crowd management vehicles"" to disperse protesters. 
A water cannon that rolled down the street flanked by officers just before sundown sent protesters retreating and shouting in fear. The streets surrounding government offices were strewn with signs of their hasty departure: bags of bricks and broken respirators, along with empty bottles of saline solution used to flush tear gas from eyes. Graffiti cursing the police was scrawled on walls and roads.
Plastic barriers splashed with red paint at the entrance to a nearby subway station were piled with other debris. Inside the sprinkler system sent water pouring onto the floor while speakers played a recorded announcement directing people to leave.
A relatively new chorus heard through the skyscrapers was ""Glory to Hong Kong,"" a song written a few weeks ago that has quickly become the movement's anthem. The composer of the song, who has been identified as Thomas, posted the lyrics and music in late August to the online LIHKG forum popular among protesters. 
A crowdsourced effort then ensued to tweak and improve the song, which has been uploaded to YouTube with video of rousing scenes and key moments of the months-long protest movement. Thousands have gathered in shopping malls around Hong Kong in recent days to belt out the song. When ""March of the Volunteers,"" the Chinese national anthem, was played before a World Cup qualifying soccer match on Tuesday between Hong Kong and Iran, supporters turned their backs, flipped middle fingers and booed. Later, ""Glory to Hong Kong,"" echoed through the stadium concourse.
Hong Kong, which is not an independent or sovereign country, has no national anthem of its own. Many here reject the Chinese national anthem and have mocked and jeered it at public events for years. After the protests over the extradition bill began in June, the government delayed a bill that would criminalize mockery of the Chinese anthem.
Protesters are marching under an intensifying threat of arrest and prosecution. Police said Thursday they had arrested 1,365 people so far between the ages of 12 and 76 since the start of the protests. More were arrested over the weekend. 
One lawyer in her early 20s said she waited to join the movement until it seemed as if there were enough people participating, out of fear she would be picked up by police. 
""We are so traumatized,"" said the woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""After all these months of tear gas, violence and arrest, we need no reminders of the risks.""

The threat of Chinese interference,"COUNTRIES AROUND the world are worrying, rightly, about Russian interference in their elections. But there's another player in the game with a lot of experience, and it isn't sitting this one out.
China began dabbling in Internet disinformation long before ""Russian troll"" became part of the American vernacular. Its so-called 50-cent army, as many as 2 million strong according to some estimates, started marching in 2004: sneaking state-sponsored narratives into organic conversations, or just distracting citizens from controversial subjects, and pretending the 448 million comments it generates a year come from ordinary people.
These manipulation attempts have historically been mostly inward-facing, while efforts to sway foreigners have focused instead on overt propaganda disseminated through 3,000 public television channels, 2,500 radio stations, 12,000 newspapers and magazines, and more than 3 million websites. But recent activity suggests that Beijing has turned its attention outward - most aggressively, not so far from home.
The Stanford Internet Observatory has identified the upcoming Taiwanese presidential election as a near-certain target for a Chinese influence campaign. Journalists discovered this summer that an upset mayoral victory in 2018 by a pro-Beijing politician in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan's largest city, was not the story it had seemed of charisma and digital know-how propelling a populist to victory. Instead, a mainland campaign had used sockpuppet accounts to gin up support, a tactic in line with researchers' findings of cross-strait operations in recent elections. Now, a presidential contest approaches, and all signs point to more of the same, or worse. 
That China is clearly prepared to turn its mammoth manipulation apparatus toward regional conflicts is bad enough: Twitter removed hundreds of thousands of spammy accounts participating in a ""state-backed information operation"" focused on Hong Kong's protest movement this summer, and Facebook kicked off a smaller collection of pages and accounts with links to Beijing around the same time. The question is whether Beijing is as willing to push further. 
President Trump's claims of Chinese meddling in the midterms so far aren't supported by the evidence, but this country should get its guard up. Reuters reported recently that an Australian government agency attributed a pre-election attack on its Parliament and top political parties this spring to Beijing but kept quiet to protect trade relations. That doesn't bode well for the United States and its allies, who will need one another's cooperation to counter any offensive. China is hardly a stranger to waging war in cyberspace, but as the U.S. presidential campaign warms up, Beijing may now mean to open a new front. That can't go unnoticed, or unchallenged."
'I will die with the city': A young woman's chilling message from Hong Kong,"Protester embodies the pro-Democracy movement's resolve
HONG KONG - Every Friday, Alexa dines at home with her father, a single man who she says is unaware of his daughter's secret. Afterward, the 21-year-old college student kisses her teddy bear good night.
Then, as the weekend arrives, she slips out of their Kowloon apartment and hits the streets to join Hong Kong's fight for democracy amid increasing crackdowns by the city's Beijing-backed authorities.

Often, she doesn't return home until Monday morning. When her father asks her whereabouts, ""I tell him I am working late,"" she said. 
Alexa is among the mostly young front-line protesters who have escalated their clashes with police in the former British colony, where Beijing is tightening its grip on local freedoms. Protests erupted in June over the Hong Kong government's now-abandoned plans to allow extraditions to mainland China, but have morphed into a broader revolt encompassing calls for universal suffrage and an independent probe into police use of force.
With Hong Kong's leadership refusing to budge on protesters' demands, few hold hopes of a sustainable political settlement. Rather than leave Hong Kong, Alexa said she has decided to stay and fight - and, if necessary, die.
Alexa - not her real name - said she threw a petrol bomb once to cast off riot police who were pursuing protesters. Other times, she has used traffic cones to smother the choking fumes of tear-gas shells. Protesters' fury has reached a boiling point, she said, as the police response has become increasingly heavy-handed. 
Hong Kong's government routinely condemns violence by protesters. Alexa characterizes the dissidents' tactics as defensive actions against an unaccountable police force intent on inflicting physical harm on her and her friends.
For women, the front line can pose particular safety risks. Reports of demonstrators alleging sexual assault by police have contributed to a drop in the number of female protesters on the front lines in recent weeks, said Alexa, who uses the alias to avoid being tracked by authorities. 
The police have denied the reports and say they have acted with reasonable force when dispersing crowds and detaining protesters. The government has said it is no longer using the San Uk Ling detention center, where some detainees allege they suffered abuse. A video of a protester describing, to a packed university hall, a sexual assault at the center was widely shared this month; police said they would investigate her allegations.
""Some male protesters asked me not to go that close to the police,"" Alexa said. ""But sometimes it feels so unfair - it would be so much better if I were a man.""
Though women account for a minority among front-line protesters, Alexa said it was critical for them to be there. ""I can't stop helping out there just because I am worried about being raped. Everyone has their fears,"" she said.
Alexa shivers whenever she walks through the city's Admiralty district, where large-scale protests and clashes with police have happened, and where she has narrowly dodged arrest.Although Hong Kong has freedom of assembly, police must authorize public processions of more than 30 people, and often have withheld approval on public-safety grounds. Anyone who turns up to unapproved demonstrations faces arrest - and a lungful of tear gas. More than 2,600 people have been arrested in the uprising.
""Every morning, I wonder if I will be arrested, and how I should explain that to my father,"" Alexa said. ""I know what I am doing is technically illegal. But . . . I don't want our future generation to spend their youth, like us, fighting for their freedoms.""
The stakes have risen as the unrest has intensified. An Amnesty International report last month alleged ""reckless and indiscriminate"" tactics by Hong Kong's police.
In late July, Alexa watched riot police beat one of her friends, she said. She was seized by two officers who dragged her by her arms. Other protesters grabbed her feet and managed to free her. But a day later, she said, she was shot just below her collarbone with a rubber bullet. 
""I thought I would die. Before that, I had always thought my last waking moment would be spent on missing my family and friends. But at that instant, I was only concerned about Hong Kong - I want to see true democracy in the city,"" she said.
Then last month, Alexa was in the firing line again when protesters tried to breach a police cordon and officers countered with force. As she tried to aid wounded friends, Alexa felt pain in her legs. She had been shot with a beanbag round.
Alexa said her father didn't notice her wounds, which she concealed beneath her clothing, because he was ""usually exhausted from work"" and she had hidden the medication she was using to treat her injuries. 

The unrest has highlighted officials' refusal to entertain political liberalization. Hong Kong's de facto constitution, the Basic Law, provides for the eventual introduction of universal suffrage following the city's return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Yet when China's government proposed electoral restructuring for Hong Kong in 2014, it offered the chance to elect only leaders preapproved by Beijing. 
When protests against the decision fizzled out after 79 days without concessions from the authorities, Alexa, like many young people, felt hopeless and wanted to emigrate.
Not this time.
""I want to fight again,"" she said. ""I don't want to leave for the rest of my life. If the city dies, I will die with the city. This is my home.""

"When Trump was booed at Nationals Park, the Fox telecast stuck to baseball","Houston's blowout win over the Washington Nationals in Game 5 of the World Series was not the year's most thrilling sporting event. The promised stellar pitching matchup between Gerrit Cole and Max Scherzer evaporated with Scherzer's injury, and by the fourth inning the Astros had a four-run lead that would never be seriously challenged.
But when President Trump was shown on the video board between the third and fourth innings, the game produced a newsworthy event, both inside sports and beyond. The home crowd booed lustily. In some pockets of Nationals Park, chants of ""Lock him up"" were heard.
The moment immediately trended on Twitter, national news outlets rushed to publish stories about the incident, and by Monday morning the hosts of MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" were among those chastising fans for their behavior.
Viewers at home watching Fox's telecast, though, did not hear about the boos when the broadcast returned from a commercial break, with one of the biggest stories of the night instead spreading across social media and news websites before landing on cable news shows.
Fox showed Trump ahead of the third inning, when the camera panned to his party. ""It's the World Series,"" Fox play-by-play announcer Joe Buck said. ""The president and first lady of the United States, Donald J. Trump and Melania Trump, are here at the game tonight in their suite. Wounded Warriors joining them for the festivities here at Nationals Park.""
Should Fox have broadcast or otherwise noted the reaction given to Trump?
""It's news, which makes it a dereliction of duty not to show it,"" said Kevin Robbins, the associate director of the Center for Sports Communication and Media at the University of Texas. ""This isn't political. It's not whether you agree with it. It's just telling you what happened.""
The complications of showing the moment are several-fold. The boos happened while the broadcast was on a commercial break, which meant the broadcast would have been showing a replay or commenting not in real time. Then, of course, there are the polarized politics of the moment, particularly when Trump is involved.
""But if you're obligated to show the president, then you're obligated to show the crowd reaction,"" Robbins said.
That was not a unanimous opinion. J.A. Adande, the director of sports journalism at Northwestern University and a former reporter at The Washington Post and ESPN
, said to hold a telecast to the standards of journalism was unfair.
""When they showed the president earlier in the broadcast, do they have to mention he's the subject of an impeachment inquiry?"" he asked. ""I think the phrase 'stick to sports' is loathsome, but a broadcast isn't journalism. When you're broadcasting the World Series, you're doing it as a partner of baseball. I think it is important to remember that. You're not there as a representative of the news division of your network.""
He added: ""If there were protests outside the stadium against Trump, I think that goes in the Metro section of The Washington Post. It's a separate story.""
Fox declined to comment.
""I'm not sure what you want Fox to do,"" said Andy Billings, the director of the University of Alabama's program in sports communication. ""People are going to have different perspectives on the prevalence of cheers to boos. Asking a broadcaster to gauge that on the spot is very difficult.""
Michael Weisman, a former lead producer for Fox baseball coverage who also formerly led NBC's Olympics coverage, said he thought Fox handled the moment correctly, noting the desire of sports broadcasts to avoid third-rail issues such as politics and religion.
""Anytime you're dealing with politicians, it's very sensitive,"" he said. ""Are they picking their nose? Are they eating a hot dog? Everyone's got an opinion. Fox was lucky the boos happened during a commercial break because if it happened during the game you have to explain the boos to the audience. But once it was at commercial, I don't think you have to go back to it.""
Weisman noted that the Fox World Series broadcast in 2001, which he was a part of, hosted then-New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in the broadcast booth in the month after 9/11. ""If there is a unifying event, then you might want it,"" Weisman said. ""But is the whole country behind Trump?"" 
In addition to the boos aimed at Trump, an ""Impeach Trump"" sign was unfurled in the outfield, and behind home plate two people briefly held up ""Veterans for Impeachment"" signage, which could be seen on the broadcast.
That sort of activism at stadiums hasn't been limited to the World Series. An in-stadium cameraman at Staples Center during a Los Angeles Clippers game recently panned to a dancing child who pulled out a ""Stand with Hong Kong"" T-shirt when he was shown on the scoreboard. The camera quickly moved away from the fan.
""The news value point is legitimate,"" Weisman said. ""There's no hard and fast rule. But where politics is right now, of course they didn't want to get involved.""

Social-networking app TikTok raises national security concerns,"Two senior members of Congress, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), asked U.S. intelligence officials late Wednesday to determine whether the Chinese-owned social-networking app TikTok poses ""national security risks.""
In a letter to Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, the lawmakers questioned TikTok's data-collection practices and whether the app adheres to censorship rules directed by the Chinese government that could limit what U.S. users see. TikTok, which provides users a feed of short videos, has become wildly popular among teenagers worldwide.
""With over 110 million downloads in the U.S. alone, TikTok is a potential counterintelligence threat we cannot ignore,"" wrote Schumer and Cotton, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee. ""Given these concerns, we ask that the Intelligence Community conduct an assessment of the national security risks posed by TikTok and other China-based content platforms operating in the U.S. and brief Congress on these findings.""
In response, TikTok leaders - writing in an unsigned blog post Thursday - sought to stress their independence from China. The company said it stores U.S. user data inside the United States and that it is not ""subject to Chinese law,"" while stressing it has ""never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content and we would not do so if asked.""
The request adds to growing regulatory headaches in the United States for TikTok and its parent company, Bytedance. The app's meteoric rise has coincided with heightened political tensions between Washington and Beijing, driven largely by a trade war that has hurt both nations' economies.
The dispute also has ensnarled U.S. corporate giants, including the National Basketball Association, whose attempts to appease China have angered U.S. lawmakers and others who question whether the sports league is capitulating on political expression and freedom of speech.
China's growing tech industry and global ambitions long have been characterized as a threat by the U.S. government and Silicon Valley, which argue that a shift in technological dominance to the world's second-largest economy could imperil U.S. business, research and national security. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg raised similar concerns in a speech in Washington on Oct. 17, fearing the Chinese government's ""Great Firewall"" might affect even what U.S. users of Chinese-based apps might consume.
In their letter, Schumer and Cotton questioned TikTok's terms of service, saying the app collects a wide array of data, including information about a user's location. TikTok officials say U.S. users' data is stored in the United States, but the lawmakers said they feared that TikTok ""is still required to adhere to the laws of China.""
That could ""compel Chinese companies to support and cooperate with intelligence work controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,"" they wrote.
Schumer and Cotton further raised the possibility that TikTok follows Chinese censorship regulations and limits videos on sensitive political topics, including recent protests in Hong Kong. A review of TikTok conducted by The Washington Post earlier this year found that the service carried far fewer videos related to those demonstrations than other popular social media sites such as Twitter.
The lawmakers also said that TikTok could be a ""potential target of foreign influence campaigns like those carried out during the 2016 election on U.S.-based social media platforms."" Russian-backed agents spread disinformation on Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites in the last presidential election, and Facebook recently revealed a new Russia-based effort targeting the 2020 race.
TikTok has repeatedly declined to discuss its content-moderation policies, including those involving disinformation.
The letter to Maguire marks the second congressional request for the government to delve into TikTok. Earlier this month, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) called on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews the national security implications of foreign acquisitions, to investigate the 2017 purchase by Bytedance of Musical.ly, an app that Bytedance merged with its own offering to create TikTok.
At the time, Rubio said the ""Chinese government's nefarious efforts to censor information inside free societies around the world cannot be accepted and pose serious long-term challenges to the U.S. and our allies.""

"At Yale's Singapore venture, a cry of censorship","When Yale University opened its first new college in 300 years, a joint venture with the National University of Singapore, the Ivy League institution acknowledged that operating in the politically restrictive city-state would mean accepting constraints on civic freedoms. But Yale judged it worth the cost to develop a liberal arts curriculum in Asia.
From the time it welcomed its first class in 2013, the Yale-NUS college did not allow partisan political groups on campus. It had to abide by local laws that prohibit protests except within a designated area of one city park known as the speakers' corner. Even then, permits are required.
So critics were not surprised when the university took another look at its one-week course on ""Dialogue and Dissent in Singapore"" and canceled it this month. Although only 16 students were enrolled, the decision has revived a debate about whether American liberal arts colleges and other Western universities are compromising their values of academic freedom and the free exchange of ideas when they expand into places with restrictive political climates such as Singapore, the Persian Gulf states and China.
Most U.S. universities that pursue such growth ""recognize that their assumptions about academic freedom will need to be adjusted,"" said Kris Olds, an expert on the globalization of public education at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. ""How far will they bend, though?""
In Singapore, the episode has also laid bare a fear among officials that Hong Kong-style protests could someday erupt on their similarly skyscraper-filled, land-scarce shores - an unlikely prospect, experts say, and not one the program was advocating.
The Yale-NUS course was among 14 off-campus learning experiences from which students had to pick one as part of their curriculum. It was to feature a lineup of Singaporean activists discussing what it means to be a dissident in the local context. Students were to visit the park where rallies are allowed, hold discussions with activists and design protest banners.
""One of the best ways to get these insights is to meet some so-called dissidents face to face,"" Alfian Sa'at, a Singaporean playwright who helped design the program, wrote in a Facebook post.
The project was canceled because it ""did not adequately cover the range of perspectives required for a proper academic examination of the political, social and ethical issues that surround dissent"" and risked ""breaking the law and incurring legal liabilities,"" Yale-NUS President Tan Tai Yong told The Washington Post.
The proposed program included a screening of ""Joshua: Teenager vs. Superpower,"" a 2017 documentary on Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong,who rose to prominence in 2014 street protests against China's refusal to grant the semiautonomous territory universal suffrage.
Tan Chuan-Jin, the speaker of Singapore's Parliament, criticized the planned course and quickly made the link to the protests that have roiled Hong Kong in recent months: ""Given what is happening in Hong Kong and elsewhere, do we believe that this is the way to go? Is this the liberal education that we need to get us into the future?""
Singapore's pro-government press published an op-ed in the main Chinese- and English-language broadsheets that went further, warning that Singapore does not need a ""color revolution."" The piece, written by a former lawmaker, parroted Chinese state media descriptions of the Hong Kong unrest, including charges that foreign forces are funding the demonstrators.
Kirsten Han, a journalist and activist who was to lead a class about democracy as part of the program, expressed disappointment over its cancellation, acknowledging that Yale-NUS was always seen as a freer space compared with other Singaporean universities.
""It was problematic from the beginning and it was always going to be really hard for them to navigate, given Singapore is not a place you can teach liberal arts openly,"" she said in an interview. ""But it was still a safer space, and the students are still incredibly enthusiastic.""
The program's cancellation sparked consternation at Yale in the United States. Peter Salovey, the university's president, said in a statement this month that he had conveyed his ""concern"" to Tan, the Yale-NUS chief, and would review the process behind the decision before determining ""the appropriate response.""
https://twitter.com/kixes/status/1172765102308651008?s=20"">
But some Yale alumni and academics say such concern underscores naivete on the part of Yale's then-leadership in believing the university's cherished reputation for rigorous academic debate and openness could be upheld when it set up shop in Singapore.
""For some 40 years, the [Singapore] government has made sure universities never become a seedbed for dissent and don't normalize political contention. There was never a chance that Yale-NUS would be exempted from this taboo,"" said Cherian George, associate dean at Hong Kong Baptist University's School of Communication.
George, a Singaporean academic, was effectively pushed out of a university in his home country, a decision seen as punishment for his critical writings.

Some students at Yale-NUS have pressed college administrators for an explanation. Averyn Thng, a third-year anthropology student, was among 30 students who met with Tan Tai Yong and the college's executive vice president after the class was canceled.
""We were very clearly told that academic freedom is something that has to be managed, and framed in a way that doesn't allow for partisanship,"" Thng said in an interview. ""But at the end of the day, what is considered partisanship is in the eyes of those who have power.""
Linda Lim, a Singaporean professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business and a Yale graduate, said the college's decision was tantamount to censorship. Yale-NUS, she said, argued at its inception that the ""bedrock value"" of academic freedom would not be compromised but rather bolstered by the college's presence in the city-state.
Yet, ""instead of Singapore becoming more like Yale in terms of academic freedom, it looks like Yale is becoming more like Singapore,"" Lim said.

A bright spot in Hong Kong: Ballet,"The ballerina in neon-lime tights and killer eyeliner struts on her toes across a street in central Hong Kong. Her insouciant swagger is part of a quirky, 40th-anniversary promotional video for Hong Kong Ballet, set to Ravel's ""Boléro."" As the snare drum crescendos, an army of similar green-legged ballerinas invades the city's harbor; their kicks slice past the skyline like blades. Male dancers in crisp suits pop, lock and bounce. Beaming matriarchs in candy-colored wigs cheer and shake their pompoms. 
The images blend ballet with martial arts, hip-hop, Chinese iconography - and compelling eccentricity. It's a punchy new look for the company, which comes across as simultaneously hip and elder-approved, reflecting the modernity and history of its home city. But for some viewers, the vibe is undoubtedly familiar. Even though the video's subject is half a world away, the style and attitude should ring bells for Washington Ballet followers. 
It's 100 percent Septime Webre. Webre, who's just wrapped up his second season as Hong Kong Ballet's director-choreographer, brought the same contemporary wit and vigor to the Washington Ballet, which he led for 17 years before stepping down in 2016. As Hong Kong grapples with civil unrest, including weeks of violent protests against proposed extradition laws that could cede more power to mainland China, Webre's leadership of the ballet has brought some good news.
The company's subscriptions have spiked more than 150 percent since the 2017-2018 season, according to Nick Chan, Hong Kong Ballet's director of marketing, and last season half the productions sold out. Outreach initiatives that Webre started, such as free ""pop-up"" shows outdoors, have attracted tens of thousands of spectators. 
As for the demonstrations, Webre says that given the timing, they haven't touched the company.
""As the protests took place during the dancers' summer holiday, and we're planning our next round of pop-up performances to launch in late August and continue through the fall, our activities haven't been affected,"" he says.
Webre is vacationing in India with his husband, Marc Cipullo; they're midway through what Webre describes as an ""eat pray love"" trip that began on the beach in Bali. ""Life gives you interesting paths you didn't expect to find yourself on,"" he says, his philosophical mood possibly influenced by the circumstances of our conversation. It's evening when we connect on Skype, and they've just left the Taj Majal to drive to Delhi for a flight to the Himalayas. Every time the car goes round a bend the Skype connection dies, but with Cipullo at the wheel, Webre takes the interruptions in stride. 
When he arrived in Hong Kong in 2017, Webre says, he found ""a beautiful, classical company"" and nearly 50 highly trained dancers. As he'd done at the Washington Ballet, he set about trying to raise the troupe's profile and build its audience while stitching it more deeply into the city's cultural life. To the existing repertoire of ""Swan Lake"" and ""The Sleeping Beauty,"" he added contemporary works by Justin Peck, Trey McIntyre and Annabelle Lopez Ochoa, and he staged some of the colorful, high-energy productions he'd created in his years at Washington Ballet: ""Alice (in Wonderland)"" and ""The Great Gatsby.""
Webre says his chief challenge was ""how do you retool the brand of the ballet so it remains Hong Kong Ballet but people think of it with a fresh energy?"" He's been implementing some of the same outreach measures he put in place in his final D.C. years, but quicker and more efficiently, he says. Some of the pop-up performances have been narrated in Tagalog, the language of the city's Filipino community.
Last fall, a flock of origami crane puppets led crowds to five-minute shows scattered about the Tai Kwun arts and shopping complex, where a prison and police station once stood. ""Over two days, about 30,000 people saw us,"" Webre says.
He's also forged partnerships with the city's arts leaders. A program called Hong Kong Cool connects ballet dancers interested in choreography with local fashion designers, composers and visual artists. Seven ballets grew from its first year; the company premiered them in a black-box theater, drawing arts followers new to ballet to the casual space and air of experimentation.""It takes a person with a very strong will and commitment to do these things,"" says Anna Chan, who worked with Webre on Hong Kong Cool when she was head of dance for the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority. ""He is actually transforming the Hong Kong Ballet into something more dynamic.""
""It's not easy for a company to allow this type of exploration when every six weeks they have a show to put on,"" Chan continues. "" . . . His energy is so welcoming that whatever we propose, he just makes it happen.""
Chan has continued to collaborate with Webre now that she's dean of dance at the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts. The ballet company, which does not yet have a permanent home, has a residency there and offers master classes for the academy students. The ballet plans to create a new work there each year, offering the students the ability to observe the process.
If timing is everything, Webre has been especially fortunate. His arrival coincides with a growth period in Hong Kong, Chan says, particularly in theaters, and the company may finally find a home at a planned cultural center.
For the 40th-anniversary video, Webre tapped the D.C. firm Design Army, which had worked with him on Washington Ballet videos. Webre has more multimedia projects planned for an initiative called ""Hong Kong Ballet Goes Viral.""
""We've received funding for dance videos to present Hong Kong Ballet in unexpected places,"" he says. ""Not just to expose people to the ballet but to remind them how beautiful the city is. People walk around with their eyes on their smartphones and then go down in the subway. But Hong Kong is such a place of creativity and beauty.""
The company gets about 65 percent of its funding from the government, Webre says, which allows for an enviable level of stability and frees him from much of the burden of fundraising. It also comes with the requirement for regular check-ins about the troupe's plans and budgeting. 
""Of course the funds must be used appropriately,"" he says, ""for the advancement of ballet in Hong Kong and the sharing of our work with the world at large. All of our plans and activities have been met with great enthusiasm thus far.""
Webre has led tours through Europe, and in 2020, plans a month-long North American tour, including Canada, Pennsylvania and the Carolinas. ""I'm sure we'll be in Washington soon,"" he says, adding that he's not supposed to reveal more.When he was a child, Webre lived in the Caribbean and Africa as the son of a sugar engineer, and he says he always imagined he'd live an expat life. But while he never saw himself living in Asia, Hong Kong suits him. ""It has a New York kind of energy, with the topography of San Francisco and this unique Asian culture."" 
The Skype connection is holding steady, and Webre takes the chance to reflect further. Things could scarcely be better: His existing ballets are being widely licensed by other companies, and he'll create his first premiere for Hong Kong Ballet in the upcoming season. It's a ""Romeo and Juliet"" set in 1960s Hong Kong; Webre was inspired by the nostalgic atmosphere of Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai's poetic ""In the Mood for Love."" 
What's been most rewarding, the director says, is having the chance to plow his past into the company's future - and watching it grow before his eyes. 
""Over the course of 17 years at the Washington Ballet and six years before that at American Repertory Ballet, I learned so much,"" Webre says. ""To go to a new company with a fresh perspective and implement with new efficiency the lessons I learned, and to be sensitive to the needs of a new city and new culture - it's fun.""

"What's worse, woke capitalism or Trump?","When I argued last week that conservatives ought to give up on President Trump, I knew what I would hear back. Religious conservatives were going to point to the Obama-era policies, such as forcing nuns to buy birth control for their employees, that led them to believe their communities and institutions were under existential threat from the government. But I also knew I'd hear an increasing fear about the private sector, and what culturally liberal companies were trying to do to conservatives.
""Woke capitalism"" has triggered great alarm on the right. I have heard it described, with no sense of irony, as the greatest threat facing Western society.
Conservatives aren't just angry that corporate America seems to be siding against them in disputes such as whether football players should kneel for the national anthem; they worry about a future in which their views are censored by Big Tech, declared anathema by employers, targeted for angry mobbings by the media. And so they feel forced to support politicians such as Trump who promise to take the fight to their enemies. 
I would question the effectiveness of this strategy, since, if anything, Trump seems to have emboldened the culture warriors within corporate America. But I won't try to argue that conservative fears are ungrounded. There really is an increasingly militant wing of the left that wants to use economic as well as political power to destroy their opponents, from Mozilla chief executive Brendan Eich (forced to step down for donating in support of California's Proposition 8) to James Damore (a Google engineer fired for a memo he wrote about the company's diversity policies) to the hapless NRA conventioneers who made the mistake of flying Delta. And as these examples suggest, the liquidationist wing seems to have a surprising amount of influence over corporate behavior.
But ""surprising"" doesn't mean ""large,"" since it is surprising for them to have any influence at all. In fact, I suspect that what little power they had has already peaked. 
Consider Google, which just issued a rather tart advisory about the freewheeling internal discussion boards where Damore's infamous memo began its viral career. The company warns that ""disrupting the workday to have a raging debate over politics"" doesn't build community, adding, ""Our primary responsibility is to do the work we've each been hired to do, not to spend working time on debates about non-work topics."" This is a pretty stunning turnaround, given the company's long history of supporting these kinds of discussions.
Yet there's a reason companies have historically discouraged workers from spending much time arguing politics; when the argument is over, the anger often lingers. Google got away with it for so long because its core business, a virtual monopoly over Internet search, throws off so much money that it can afford to indulge worker desires for an activist workplace. Effectively, bringing your politics to the job site was a form of compensation for the woke workforce.
Only that market position isn't quite as impregnable as it looked a few years ago. For reasons that have nothing to do with the political skew of the company's workforce, governments are getting more and more interested in curbing the power of tech firms, and thus their revenue. Meanwhile, Google faces competitive pressure in its non-search markets, including from Amazon (whose founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, owns The Post). The company can't necessarily afford the luxury of an internal message system that's getting everyone riled up, without any commensurate increase in productivity - or worse, one that helps workers to organize to force the company out of potentially profitable lines of business.
Moreover, the wokest firms are extremely geographically concentrated along the coasts. Apple chief executive Tim Cook can rail against Indiana's religious freedom law, but practically speaking, what can he do - close the state's two Apple stores? The geographic concentration is what drives the woke warrior phenomenon, since it's easiest to want to destroy people if you don't know them. But it also dramatically limits its scope. 
And that scope is already limited, because large public companies aren't going to pursue their principles at the expense of any sizable self-interest. Note how many of the firms that are loudest in their denunciations of American political groups are quiet about the Chinese government, which is violently suppressing protest in Hong Kong and herding religious minorities into reeducation camps. I don't say that this is admirable, but I do say that it is a fact.
So while I sympathize with conservatives who fear that woke capital is selling them out, I can't agree that those fears justify selling the soul of conservatism to Trump. It's true, woke capitalism will sell you out. The thing is, if you wait long enough - and not very long at that - it will sell out your opponents, too.

A Latin Spring? These protests aren't all alike.,"Across South America, objectives differ, though economic pain is shared 


In Ecuador, a government besieged by protesters and forced to flee the capital. In Chile, 2,500 injured and at least 20 dead in weeks of unrest. In Bolivia, police stations attacked, homes of politicians torched and Latin America's longest-serving president driven into exile. 
South America is no stranger to unrest. But from the Caribbean coast to Patagonia, the outbreak of popular uprisings this year is already the region's strongest and most widespread in decades.
Some are calling it a Latin Spring. But unlike the popular rebellions across the Arab world nearly a decade ago, when oppressed and impoverished citizens revolted against apathetic dictatorships, the still-unfolding uprisings in South America are as varied as the countries themselves.
In Chile, fury over a pocketbook issue "" a subway fare increase "" has snowballed into a deeper movement against elites and a right-leaning, democratically elected government. In Peru, the street rose up to back President Martín Vizcarra in his crusade to close down a corrupt Congress.

In Ecuador, indigenous groups and left-leaning students pressured their government into restoring gasoline subsidies. In Bolivia, pro-democracy and right-wing forces drove power-clinging president Evo Morales from office after his socialists stood accused of stealing an election.
In Venezuela, an outlier in the current protests, a starving nation has risen up "" unsuccessfully, so far "" against a socialist dictatorship accused of destroying the economy. Opposition leader Juan Guaidó has called for more demonstrations Saturday.
But all of these events are taking place against a shared backdrop: the painful aftermath of a commodities boom. Rising prices of the fuels, minerals and crops at the heart of the region's resource-rich economies at the start of the 21st-century helped lift millions out of poverty. The revenue also raised expectations "" expectations now unmet in the half-dozen years since the boom went bust. A new middle class fears slipping back down the socioeconomic ladder.
As nations tighten their belts in leaner times, the pressure is hitting the poor and middle classes disproportionately, while elites are largely shielded "" fueling grass-roots rage. Add weak institutions, structural inequality, political polarization and a corrupt ruling class unwilling to cede power, and you have a recipe for regional unrest.
'The millions of Latin Americans who joined the middle class in the past two decades are bearing the brunt of economic adjustment and austerity,' said Moisés Naím, a former executive director of the World Bank. 'The difference is that now, this larger middle class is activated, better informed, more educated, deeply connected by social media, and more able to resist and protest.'
Analysts also point to the 'inspiration factor' from nation to nation "" and not only South American neighbors. Activists in Chile and Bolivia, for instance, have studied and adopted tactics employed by protesters in Hong Kong. And in some nations "" particularly Bolivia, Chile and Ecuador "" protests have been fueled in part by the fact that they're getting results.
The upheaval now is a far cry from the military coups and dirty wars that scarred the region during the Cold War.
Yet analysts remain fearful of the long-term consequences, particularly at a time when support for democracy is flagging significantly across the region. They point to massive street protests in Brazil in 2013 that many say laid the groundwork for the rise of Jair Bolsonaro, the country's far-right president, who critics say has deepened divisions and undermined democracy in Latin America's largest nation.
'You cannot be certain that more of these countries are not going to revert back to populism because the people are angry and they don't trust anything else,' said Patricio Navia, a political scientist at Diego Portales University in Santiago, Chile. 'It can be on the left, like in Venezuela, or right, like in Brazil. But discontent can take you in the wrong direction.'

'Incredibly happy moment'
Indeed, there's discontent at both ends of the political spectrum.
In the chilly mountain city of La-Paz, Bolivia, on Sunday morning, activist Jhanisse Vaca, 26, was bleary-eyed but determined. She had spent the night in the street with other protesters in front of a police station. Their aim: persuade the police to join the fight to oust the socialist Morales.
At 5-a.m., the Organization of American States issued a damning audit of the Oct.-20 election, showing that they had been rigged to put Morales over the threshold he needed to win in the first round and avoid a risky runoff.
The 60-year-old socialist had claimed victory. 
The opposition claimed fraud.

The protests began on election night "" some peaceful, some not. Vaca, who founded a nonviolent pro-democracy group in 2017 and supported Morales's top rival, former president Carlos Mesa, drew inspiration from protest movements worldwide. Her group watched videos on social media of the student protests in Hong Kong, where demonstrators sang 'Happy Birthday' to warn of infiltrators entering their ranks. Vaca's group adopted a similar tactic "" singing the Bolivian national anthem instead.
Vaca had long considered Morales a tyrant. But her father, a physician, had once supported Bolivia's first indigenous president, who was credited with reducing poverty and lifting up the country's indigenous majority.
'We thought he'd really fight for the people,' she said. 'But instead, he focused on amassing power.'
Morales ran for a fourth term despite losing a 2016 referendum to extend term limits. (He later won a court ruling that enabled him to run.) As public pressure grew Sunday, he offered a new election. But it wasn't enough.
Thousands of furious protesters took to the streets, and the heads of the armed forces and national police called on him to resign. Vaca was near the presidential palace when word spread through the crowd: After nearly 14 years in office, Morales was stepping down. 
'Everyone was jumping and shouting,' she said. 'A friend confirmed it on his phone, and it was just an incredibly happy moment. We hugged the policemen who passed by.'
Yet Bolivia's future remains clouded. Morales's departure for Mexico has not ended violent protests. The ex-president and his socialists, still a massive force in the country, have decried a 'coup.' Jeanine Áñez, the anti-Morales second vice president of the Senate, claimed the presidency Tuesday and vowed to call new elections within 90 days. But socialist lawmakers, a majority in Congress, have rejected her appointment, deepening the crisis.
'I'm a little worried about what's coming,' Vaca said. 'But I still have hope.'
'Inside, it's rotten'
On the other side of the Andes, two days before the Bolivian election, Sebastián Candia, a 26-year-old lawyer in Chile, was about to join a very different kind of uprising.
For days, students in Chile "" South America's model of a free-market economy and an oasis of regional stability "" had been jumping turnstiles at subway stations to protest the transit rate increase. The increase was part of right-wing billionaire president Sebastián Piñera's plan to control spending as the Chilean economy slowed. 
On a bus trip from his home in coastal Viña del Mar to a birthday party in Santiago, the capital, Candia looked out the window and saw hundreds of police officers struggling to control a legion of protesters behind makeshift barricades. It was Oct.-18, the day protests in Chile escalated to a full-scale national emergency.
He felt a rush of excitement. The nation was standing up.
'Chile is a pretty-looking tin-roofed house in the slum that is Latin America,' he said. 'But when you look inside, it's rotten.'
South America's wealthiest nation had achieved a massive reduction in poverty since 2000. But it remains one of the region's most unequal. Candia is a product of the 'new Chile' "" the son of a carpenter who became the first in his family to attend college. 
But after graduating last year with a law degree from one of the nation's top universities, he was saddled with $19,000 in debt and unable to find a job. Meanwhile, his family was drowning amid the climbing cost of living in free-market Chile, which lacks many of the state subsidies offered in other nations in the region. Their electricity and gas were cut off for three months a couple of years ago because they couldn't pay the bills.
'Good jobs are reserved for the elite with connections,' Candia said. 'I feel deceived, disappointed.'

The next day, he decided to join the protests, Chile's largest uprising since the restoration of democracy in 1990. Candia and a group of friends began banging pots and pans "" a classic form of protest in Latin America. He has gone out almost every day since. 
Piñera soon rescinded the transit price increase, but for protesters "" now backed by left-wing parties and labor unions "" it was no longer enough. Clashes with police accused of torturing, raping and blinding protesters have raged for weeks. Thousands of demonstrators have been arrested, and some have been charged with setting deadly fires. But the protests "" and Candia "" have not stopped.
As opposition politicians and activists have joined the demonstrations, demands have grown from rescinding the subway fare increase to throwing out the constitution, drafted during the ruthless, right-wing dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
On Monday, a day after Morales's fall, Piñera agreed to start the process to draft a new one. But the government's suggested path "" a document to be drafted by lawmakers "" has not been enough to quiet the Chilean street, which is demanding the direct involvement of the people. 
'What do we want?' Candia asked. 'A new society where we can actually take part in the country's progress.'

"Solomon Islands government ends recognition of Taiwan, aligns with Beijing","BEIJING - The Chinese government scored a fresh diplomatic coup Monday over Taiwan and the United States after the Solomon Islands, a strategically significant archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, severed ties with Taipei in favor of Beijing.

The island nation's defection whittled the number of countries that recognize Taiwan down to just 16 after Beijing flipped key allies, including the Dominican Republic and El Salvador, in recent years, over objections from Washington.
The development intensifies pressure on Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, who has struggled to counter a mounting Chinese economic and diplomatic blockade designed to force Taiwan, a democracy of 23 million people, to the table for unification talks.
""The end of our relations with the Solomon Islands reflects China's unceasing efforts to lure away our allies, damage the morale of the Taiwanese people, & force us to accept 'one country, two systems,' "" Tsai said on Twitter, referring to an offer by Chinese President Xi Jinping to bring Taiwan under Beijing's control while allowing it to retain democratic freedoms.
""To this,"" Tsai continued, ""the people of Taiwan say: not a chance.""
China kick-started a campaign in 2016 to isolate Taiwan and throttle its economy after voters elected Tsai, who is bitterly opposed by the Communist government in Beijing because she leans toward declaring outright independence for Taiwan.
Since Tsai's victory, China has pressured international corporations to recognize Taiwan as a part of China and successfully persuaded a half-dozen countries to swap allegiances, using generous aid packages to escalate pressure on Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party. Tsai was beaten soundly in local elections last year and faces reelection in 2020. 
A task force formed by the Solomon Islands' Parliament recommended this month that the government switch ties and set up a diplomatic mission in Beijing. Taiwan shot back with a warning last week that the country would fall into ""economic slavery"" if it aligned with China.
Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare, who has previously argued that siding with China would make far greater economic sense, endorsed the switch in a cabinet meeting Monday, Taiwan's official Central News Agency reported.

The swap will enhance China's growing presence in the string of lightly populated South Pacific islands where Taiwan and the United States - which fought key battles during World War II on Guadalcanal, the Solomons' main island and site of its capital - once held sway. 
In recent years, the United States, Taiwan's most important backer, has warned wavering countries such as El Salvador against abandoning Taiwan - to no avail. The Trump administration has stepped up its support for Taiwan and Tsai with arms sales as it seeks a tougher approach against China.
Taiwan has only small allies left in the Pacific, such as Palau and the Marshall Islands.
China's Foreign Ministry did not immediately comment Monday, nor did the most authoritative state mouthpieces. The Communist Party-controlled Global Times said on social media that Taiwan was now all but isolated.
""After the Solomon Islands, they only have 16 'friends' left, and most are micro-countries that people wouldn't be able to locate,"" the newspaper said.
China loosened its economic blockade during the administration of Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou, whose party, Kuomintang, favored closer ties to the mainland.
But Tsai, who does not recognize an informal 1992 agreement that asserts the existence of only ""one China,"" is anathema to Chinese leaders, who consider the agreement a nonnegotiable condition for cross-strait relations. 
Despite her diplomatic travails, Tsai appears to have gained some domestic support in recent months as anti-China protests have gripped Hong Kong, a territory to which Beijing has similarly promised political freedoms. Tsai handily beat back a primary challenge in June and has repeatedly warned voters that Taiwan could become the next Hong Kong if it aligns itself with China.
The ""one country, two systems"" framework could not work in Hong Kong, Taiwan or anywhere else, Tsai said in August, because ""authoritarianism and democracy cannot coexist.""

U.S. advances sale of jets to Taiwan,"The Trump administration is pressing ahead with an $8 billion sale of new F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, a move likely to raise strong objections from China amid the deepening trade dispute between Washington and Beijing.
The State Department submitted the package to Congress for informal review late Thursday, and it is not expected to meet opposition, according to several U.S. officials and other people familiar with the matter. It would be the largest and most significant sale of weaponry to Taiwan in decades.
The deal has been in the works for months, and lawmakers from both political parties had questioned whether the White House would scuttle it with hopes of softening the ground for a U.S.-China trade pact or otherwise seek to use the jets as a bargaining chip in the deadlocked negotiations.
Neither the White House nor the State Department responded to requests for comment. 
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, hailed the move in a statement Friday, calling it ""an important step in support of Taiwan's self-defense efforts.""
Likewise, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.) and ranking Republican Michael McCaul (Tex.) said in a statement that the sale ""sends a strong message about the U.S. commitment to security and democracy in the Indo-Pacific.""
The Chinese Embassy did not respond to a request for comment, but Beijing has repeatedly expressed its hostility to such deals.
""China's position to firmly oppose arms sales to Taiwan is consistent and clear,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in March, after press reports that the Trump administration had tacitly approved the sale. ""We have made stern representations to the U.S. We have urged the U.S. to fully recognize the sensitivity of this issue and the harm it will cause.""
Taiwan split from China in 1949 and set up a rival government in Taipei. Beijing continues to view the self-governing island as a renegade state that will one day return to China. To prevent an outbreak of hostilities that would draw in the United States, every president since Richard Nixon has adhered to a one-China policy, recognizing Taiwan as a part of China. But Washington's staunch commitment to defend Taiwan is a sensitive issue with Beijing, which claims that the United States is interfering in its internal affairs.

Some experts said that advancing the arms sale now, amid stalled trade talks and pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, will exacerbate the already fraught U.S.-China relationship. They also fear that the sale could result in China imposing sanctions on U.S. defense companies that sell arms to Taiwan and do business in China.
""Taiwan's defense is intrinsically important to the United States, but the timing of this move, amid the trade war and major instability in Hong Kong, is exceptionally precarious,"" said Evan Medeiros, former White House senior director for Asia in the Obama administration and a professor at Georgetown University. ""It will make trade negotiations and managing the Hong Kong situation even harder than it already is.""
He added that it would also fuel conspiracy theories that the United States is behind the unrest in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous part of China. Observers fear that China could launch a military crackdown there. Such a crackdown could embolden Beijing to confront Taiwan.
China last month accused the United States of a ""vain plot"" to arm the island after the Trump administration approved a $2.2 billion sale of Abrams tanks and Stinger surface-to-air missiles and allowed Taiwan's leader to visit New York. 
Taiwan requested 66 American-made fighter jets. The United States has not sold new fighter jets to Taiwan since 1992. This month, the congressional delegation from South Carolina, which includes Senate Foreign Relations Committee member Lindsey O. Graham (R), sent a letter to the president urging him to support the sale. The lawmakers said the deal would be ""critical"" to sustaining thousands of jobs in their state. 
Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, played down the risk of a Chinese overreaction to the advancing arms deal. ""China never likes U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. Will they object? Yes. Is this going to trigger a crisis in the relationship? No. This in and of itself is not going to derail progress on a trade agreement.""
She said the new aircraft would be comparable in capability to F-16 jet upgrades approved by the Obama administration. ""This is not a new capability,"" she said. 
Eric Sayers, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and a former aide to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who before his death last year led the powerful Armed Services Committee, credited the administration with ""returning to a normalized process where arms sales to Taiwan are considered individually instead of packaged into large bundles and delayed for years.""
However, he said, the enormous price tag will put the onus on Taiwan to grow its $12 billion defense budget to sustain key spending on training and personnel.
Other experts have questioned the operational utility of fighter jets for Taiwan, given its relatively small defense budget compared with Beijing's, and have argued that the money would be better spent on asymmetric defense capabilities, such as missiles, mines and air-defense weapons.
Both Medeiros and Glaser noted Beijing's previous threats to sanction U.S. companies that sell arms to Taiwan. Though China has not acted in the past, Glaser said, ""there is some possibility that they will follow through on their threat this time."" 
The Chinese government accused the Trump administration of ""playing the 'Taiwan card' "" last month when Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen visited New York.
Trump took the unusual step of speaking by phone with Tsai in 2016 when he was president-elect, alarming China. Since then he has courted a warm relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping and said little about Taiwan.
Tsai faces reelection next year and is casting her leadership as a counterpoint to an increasingly repressive and assertive mainland China. This has endeared her to Trump administration officials who are hawkish on China, but Trump's own views are unclear.

Union leader: Perspective is vital,"NBA players association boss vows to educate athletes before they head overseas
Before LeBron James and China, there was Kevin Durant and India.
Two years ago, Durant, fresh off winning the first title and NBA Finals MVP award of his career, went on a summer tour of India. He visited the Taj Mahal and hosted training sessions with local children, but he returned home facing an international controversy. In an interview with the Athletic, Durant said India was ""20 years behind in terms of knowledge"" and that there were ""cows in the street [and] monkeys running around everywhere."" After his comments were criticized as culturally insensitive, he apologized and said he meant ""no offense"" and that he should have been more careful with his wording.
That saga feels like ancient history following the outrage sparked by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey's tweet in support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong last month. James was pilloried by major American politicians for refusing to criticize China, ignoring the protesters and dismissing Morey's political statement as inconvenient given its timing right before the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets played exhibitions in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Rockets star James Harden was also condemned for apologizing for Morey's tweet. All told, that made three NBA MVPs who faced major backlash for comments on international issues since 2017.
For National Basketball Players Association Executive Director Michele Roberts, the size and scope of the China saga provided a wake-up call: Something needs to change, or NBA players will continue to find themselves embroiled in international incidents.
""We don't have the luxury of confining ourselves to the four corners of the United States,"" Roberts told The Washington Post in a phone interview. ""As the game is expanding [globally] and the union is interested in having a greater impact outside the U.S., I need to, and the players need to, be more aware of the world around us. [The China standoff brought] difficult days, and the problem hasn't gone away. We need to address it as a union and as a sport. We've got to be a little bit more intentional about how we navigate the world given what happened this past [month].""
Some portion of the criticism directed at James and Durant focused on their perceived ignorance. James acknowledged he hadn't followed the Hong Kong protests, and Durant spoke at length about how his preconceived notions of India and its culture did not match what he saw during his first trip to the country.
Roberts admitted that the union has not done enough to help prepare players before their international travels and that it is the NBPA's responsibility to take proactive steps to prevent its members from doing unintentional harm to their reputations and brands.
""For many of the players that went over there, it was their first trip to China,"" Roberts said. ""Many had no idea what was going on in Hong Kong. Most Americans, let alone most basketball players, are not aware of the politics that have been of concern in China. If we're going to be sending our guys all over the globe, then we have to make sure they're armed with the knowledge of where they are going and what's happening in the locales they're visiting and playing in.
""That's a role we're going to play as a union. It's a role I don't think we've done a good job of fulfilling to date. We've got to be capable of providing information to the players [and assisting them if] they ask for help in formulating a comment.""
As the China issue has shifted to the back burner with the season in full swing, Roberts has started to look ahead to the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. Her hope is that the competition will be a unifying event and an opportunity to heal. The Olympics will also be another major test for the players, who will be headed abroad for more international exhibitions during the closing months of the 2020 presidential election campaign.
Until then, Roberts offered to be a sounding board for any players who might be struggling to make sense of current events.
""The players are pretty independent,"" she said. ""They don't ring my phone off the hook asking me what they should say. I sometimes wish they would.""

"In Hong Kong, no heroes or martyrs","HONG KONG - As midnight approached on a decisive evening this week, protesters had paralyzed Hong Kong's airport, but their movement itself was encountering turbulence.
Negative headlines about the airport seizure led international news. A frenzied mob effectively took two Chinese men hostage, ignoring pleas for restraint in the crowd, and then bickered among themselves about what to do. Clashes with riot police left a haze of pepper spray at the door of one of the world's most vital transit hubs.
Protesters who have carefully curated their image - they're known for clearing pathways for ambulances and for leaving civilian property untouched - sensed a defining moment for their movement, whose adherents say they are in the fight of their lives defending Hong Kong's freedoms and autonomy against the mighty Chinese Communist Party. Now, they risked being branded as thugs, extremists and radicals.
A group of 70 protesters, motivated by an outpouring of posts on a Reddit-like chat forum, were among the first to step in to handle the image crisis. By dawn on Wednesday, they decided what was needed: They would apologize to the world.
Throughout the summer, a distinctive feature of the protests, sparked by a proposal to allow extraditions to mainland China, has been their lack of visible leadership - small factions organizing their own rallies, others setting up media groups, donating supplies, lending expertise on how to extinguish tear gas. Strategies and mobilization have been openly discussed and voted upon by tens of thousands of people on LIHKG.com, a messaging board, and chats on the encrypted messaging app Telegram have directed demonstrators based on crowdsourced information at rallies.
More recently, however, as protests have entered an uncertain new phase, a few influential groups of coordinators have emerged to subtly steer a movement that otherwise lacks a nucleus.
Distinct groups drive action
One of these influential groups, whose activities can be pieced together through recruitment ads, public statements and interviews with members and other protesters, is made up of about 1,000 contributors who analyze popular sentiment on the forum and communicate their consensus to the world through masked representatives and social media pamphleteering.
The result, researchers of the Hong Kong movement say, is an almost platonic ideal of an Internet-driven movement: democratic, transparent, anonymous, without heroes or martyrs.
""You see the emergence of the truly decentralized, networked movement,"" said Edmund Cheng, a professor of politics at Hong Kong Baptist University whose research group has interviewed 6,600 protesters this year. ""We have to invent a new word for it. It's closer to the ideal form than anything we've seen so far.""The phenomenon is characteristic of a city with a 90 percent Internet-penetration rate - 95 percent of users access the Web with mobile phones - but also of its political dynamics, Cheng said. Unlike the Arab Spring or Ukraine's pro-Western uprising in 2014, local authorities have not shut down Internet access to cripple communications.
Activists' tactics also have fueled a riskier approach by authorities and the police that differs from a pro-democracy uprising five years ago. Where authorities homed in on the leaders of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, eventually jailing them, their response this time has been to treat everyone as a provocateur. This blanket approach has led to huge numbers of arrests and the liberal use of tear gas by police, even in residential areas.
After police again declined to authorize marches planned for this weekend, many activists say they are worried about a sharp escalation in force. Online forums in recent days have lit up with discussion about how to deal with the increasing numbers of undercover officers dressed like protesters, a tactic authorities have acknowledged.
Chinese state media have been baying for ever-tougher measures to quash the dissent, pointing to the assembly of armed police just across the border from Hong Kong. Nationalist tabloid Global Times tweeted an editorial that said forceful Chinese intervention was clearly an option.

As demonstrations have devolved into running street skirmishes over the past two months, volunteer groups have created websites that aggregate video streams from news outlets and digital maps that show the location of police formations and exit routes, in case protesters are trapped by charging riot squads. Large groups on Telegram issue time-stamped updates to tens of thousands of users about where police have been sighted and where they are firing tear gas.
One protester, Gigi, who like many demonstrators gave only one name to protect her identity, said she does not plan where she joins each protest. ""Depending on the information that is given ad hoc on Telegram channels or LIHKG.com, then I decide where and what time to join.""
Online debate spurs apology
The flat, digitally driven structure contrasts with the 2014 protests, when leading figures such as Hong Kong University law professor Benny Tai and Joshua Wong, then a high school student, dominated megaphones and delivered speeches at a stage in central Hong Kong.
In June, as protesters lay siege to the police headquarters, Wong took to a megaphone again. But this time, many protesters seemed to pay more attention to their smartphones than to the icon of the 2014 movement who went to jail in 2017 for his activism, said Antony Dapiran, the author of ""City of Protest.""
""There was a widespread feeling people didn't like others onstage giving directions,"" said Bonnie Leung, an organizer of the Civil Human Rights Front, a group that has organized logistics for massive parades this year but has otherwise avoided assuming any authority or leadership.
The 2014 protests were fractured by infighting between nonviolent demonstrators called the ""wo lei fei"" - meaning peace, reason, nonviolence - and militant radicals nicknamed ""braves."" This year, there is a consensus that the movement's various wings should resolve differences on chat platforms and refrain from descending into public, internecine conflict, Leung said.
As chaos unfolded at the airport Tuesday night, LIHKG, the Cantonese-language hub for protesters' chatter, erupted with concern in real-time about the wisdom of blocking passengers from boarding flights and, later, holding hostages.Some resisted an apology because it would cast the movement as in the wrong, but a consensus emerged that the protesters faced an image problem. ""If we don't do public relations, we're dead!"" said one poster, as others began seeking people knowledgeable in French, Korean and Japanese to draft multilingual apologies.
Hui Fung Chung, a researcher in the Baptist University group, said LIHKG offered a real-time glimpse into the amorphous movement's thinking as they upvoted (or ""pushed"") viewpoints One apology thread received 4,000 pushes.
""The deliberation is actually nearly simultaneous with what's happening in the airport,"" Hui said.
As the public debate unfolded Tuesday, heated deliberations raged in private Telegram groups to which more active members attached themselves.

Michelle, 25, who is part of a 6,000-strong group that mostly handles Chinese and English publicity for the movement, said her group deliberated for hours, starting at midnight, to verify photos and videos from the standoff and debunk disinformation before they agreed to issue an apology.
By 6 a.m. Wednesday, some members began drafting the basic statement, while others were tasked with translation, proofreading and graphic design to make an image that would be shared on social media.Rita, an administrator of the Guardians of Hong Kong, a collection of about 70 people that broadcasts news in English on Twitter as well as a popular Telegram channel, said her group was also gripped by heated disputes. But members agreed to support the apology when they saw letters emerge from other groups and a majority view on public forums, she said.
""It is a leader-full movement,"" said Johnson Yeung, an activist who was arrested at a protest last month. ""There are so many movement centers in this movement. Each different center of movement consists of several [areas of] expertise, and they will suggest strategies that will contribute to the larger goal.""
Different loosely organized ""cells,"" for instance, offer legal or public relations expertise, Yeung said.
Secret club at core
One of the most authoritative groups has been a secretive ""citizens"" club that has held several news conferences this month. At each event, the group puts forward a different panel of masked speaker
netizens on LIHKG.
The citizens group members were among those who issued apologies this week for ""radical"" actions at the airport.
The group, which consists of about 50 to 60 core members, recently started using algorithms to gauge sentiment on online forums, said a 23-year-old who spoke at a Thursday news conference and asked to be identified as Mr. Kam.
Although the group tries to accurately convey the movement's sentiments, its rotating spokespeople acknowledge that their group cannot be the definitive voice for thousands of people.
""We cannot be a representative of every protester, for example, about the apology,"" said one masked spokesmen who gave his name on Thursday as David Ho. ""It is normal to have arguments about these issues.""
Several researchers said the citizens club appeared to be the closest the movement had to a core.
""They are, if not the actual core, then very close to it,"" said Claudia Mo, a leading opposition figure and pro-democracy lawmaker.
Although the movement apologized this week for affecting civilians, Mo said there seemed to be a greater tolerance for clashing with police in this leaderless, online-driven uprising compared with 2014, when the protest leadership disavowed violence.
""All Hong Kongers know the fact that it's thanks to the violent or radical young that the extradition bill is actually dead now,"" she said ""The Umbrella Movement petered out. But this time they're fighting for their future; they're fighting the way they want to fight.""
As the movement looks toward this weekend, when clashes with police are widely expected, radical ""braves"" on LIHKG have debated whether to establish a code called ""militant rules."" One post recommended that everyone agree not to hit journalists, paramedics and civilians. If somebody catches a suspected undercover spy, they should alert people on Telegram immediately.
""If we're fighting a war, then troops must prioritize discipline,"" said the post, which received 5,700 pushes. ""One or two numskulls can destroy the whole movement.""

China hits out at U.S. 'babbling' in effort to mute Tiananmen commentary,"Taiwan and Hong Kong mark protests 30 years ago 
BEIJING - June 4, 1989, was a day of violent clashes between young Chinese who wanted democratic reforms and authorities who were prepared to use deadly force to stop them. Thirty years later, the Chinese authorities have turned June 4, 2019, into a day of verbal clashes with the United States, which it sees as posing a different kind of existential threat.
The Foreign Ministry lashed out at Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for his ""deranged babbling"" about the Tiananmen massacre, while the Ministry of Culture and Tourism warned Chinese tourists to consider the risks of traveling to the United States, noting the ""frequent occurrence of shootings, robberies and theft"" there. 
Its warning, published on the Chinese version of Twitter a day after a similar warning to Chinese students at U.S. colleges, included a hashtag alluding to the protracted trade war between the United States and China. 
Together, the statements show how the trade war is expanding to incorporate other aspects of the relationship between the world's two largest economies.
""The deranged babbling of these people will only end up in the trash can of history,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday when asked about a statement that Pompeo had issued the previous day.
In it, the secretary of state said that the United States would ""salute the heroes of the Chinese people who bravely stood up thirty years ago in Tiananmen Square to demand their rights."" He called on China to make a ""full, public accounting of those killed or missing"" since that day.
No one knows how many people were killed in clashes concentrated in Beijing and the southwestern city of Chengdu after six weeks of protests calling for more openness and freedom - and in some cases, for outright democracy - in a country that had been controlled by the Communist Party for 40 years by that stage.Since then, the party has instituted strict controls to make sure these kinds of protests can never happen again, including almost entirely erasing any mention of the demonstrations and their bloody aftermath from the official history. There was no mention of the anniversary in state media, which instead announced the design of a new logo to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the People's Republic of China, which falls on Oct. 1.
In Tiananmen Square on Tuesday, the usual throngs of tourists lined up to pass through security checks to enter the square or the Forbidden City on its northern edge, passing by scores of police officers and under hundreds of surveillance cameras using facial-recognition technology. 
Numerous foreign journalists who attempted to report in the square Tuesday were harassed by police and forced to delete photos, according to the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China.
The English-language website of the Global Times, a national newspaper that often trumpets the foreign policy positions of the Communist Party, was the only state-linked media outlet to note the anniversary. It used the day to run a long story about how strong and mature China was today - and how superior it was to the United States.
Although young Chinese used to dream of studying abroad 30 years ago, those dreams had now faded, the paper reported.

It quoted a 28-year-old from Shanghai, Wang Xiao, talking about his high expectations before he went to study at a high school and university in the United States.
""After I went there, I found that the U.S. was far from being perfect,"" he said, according to the paper. ""Aside from problems like racism, gun use and abortion, which harm and divide the U.S. society, the low efficiency of the government, slow and poor infrastructure construction, and the inefficacy of labor unions in the U.S. deeply impacted Wang's impressions,"" the Global Times continued.
The Ministry of Culture and Tourism also issued its warning Tuesday about being aware of the risks of visiting the United States. Just the day before, the Education Ministry warned potential and current students about the prospect of visa problems and of being accused of ""nontraditional espionage"" activities.The restrictions for Chinese citizens from offering any alternative points of view Tuesday were tangible. People who tried to change their profile photos on social media sites including WeChat and Weibo received messages saying that the system was undergoing maintenance. Comments on video-sharing sites were disabled.
The authorities said there was no need to revisit the events of 1989.
The government in Taiwan, however, used the anniversary to offer itself as an alternative to the Communist Party. 
Taiwanese Foreign Minister Jaushieh Joseph Wu posted an image on Twitter showing the numbers 6489, referring to the date of the crackdown. ""Confess, apologise & never do harm again. Set the people of #China free,"" he wrote in an initialed tweet.
As the overcast sky darkened in Hong Kong, tens of thousands gathered in Victoria Park, as they've done year after year for the past three decades in commemoration of the Tiananmen crackdown.

Demonstrators gathered in the large park creating a sea of lights, their candles brightening a tree-lined arena.For many Hong Kong youths who later went on to stage their own fight against Chinese Communist Party control, the yearly vigil has been a testament to their city's unique status: the only place on Chinese soil where one not only can openly discuss the massacre of 1989 but can organize demonstrations around it.
This year, more showed up to commemorate the events of 30 years ago - as well as nod to Hong Kong's own fight amid the erosion of the ""one country, two systems"" framework that promised the territory key freedoms, including its own legal, economic and immigration systems.
In particular, they are concerned about a new proposal allowing people in Hong Kong to be extradited to China.
""The reason why we still go is because we share the same pursuit of democracy and freedom as the ones in 1989, facing the same brutal regime,"" said Nathan Law, a former lawmaker and pro-democracy activist.

Karen Chan, 29, participated in the vigil for the first time Tuesday.
""I was born in 1989, so this anniversary is very special for me,"" she said. ""I feel very lucky to participate. At least this is a freedom we still have.""

China has learned how to respond to Trump's volatility,"A year into trade war, president's about-faces aren't fazing Beijing
BEIJING - President Trump may think he's keeping Chinese negotiators guessing with his whiplash-inducing remarks about the U.S.-China trade war.
But he's not fooling anyone here.
More than a year into the deepening commercial conflict, Chinese officials and analysts say they've got a handle on the tweeter-in-chief and are no longer fazed by his unpredictable initiatives.
""There is a lot of fatigue with President Trump's 'art of the deal,' "" said Wang Huiyao, president of the Center for China and Globalization and an adviser to China's cabinet.
""It's like a roller coaster. Buenos Aires, Osaka, Shanghai. He says one thing one day, then hits the world with a surprise the next day,"" Wang said, referring to the sites of high-level, if ill-fated, negotiating sessions. ""The more they deal with him, the more they figure him out.""At the Group of Seven leaders' summit in Biarritz, France, this weekend, Trump brushed aside complaints that his habit of swerving between tough talk and a salesman's hype was damaging the global economy.
""Sorry! It's the way I negotiate,"" he told reporters Monday. ""It's done very well for me over the years. It's doing very well for the country.""
It hasn't, however, produced a deal that would commit China to make the structural changes in its state-led economy that the administration has been seeking for more than a year.
Trump has announced tariffs that by Dec. 15 will cover almost 97 percent of the Chinese merchandise that American companies import, according to economist Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
By depressing demand for Chinese goods, U.S. tariffs have cost 3 million Chinese factory workers their jobs, according to Trump, and put pressure on Chinese President Xi Jinping to make a deal.
Trump's claim to have the upper hand at the negotiating table does not appear to have convinced the Chinese.""They've decided Trump is a vacillating guy who can't figure out what he wants and gets spooked every time the stock market goes down or someone accuses him of not being tough,"" said Arthur Kroeber, managing director of Gavekal Dragonomics, a consultancy in Beijing. ""Although there are problems in China, they believe they have their economy under control, more so than Trump. They think he is more vulnerable to a slowdown and that they can afford to wait him out.""

By early May, the two sides had completed 90 percent of a deal involving major Chinese purchases of American farm, industrial and energy products as well as enhanced protections for foreign companies' technology and trade secrets, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said this summer. 
 But the trade war between the world's economic superpowers appears to have entered a dangerous new phase this month, with new rounds of retaliatory tariffs and a demand from Trump that U.S. companies stop doing business with China.
That has caused alarm across the globe, with fears that the war could help tip leading economies such as Japan and Germany into recession and create new head winds for the U.S. economy. China's growth has, meanwhile, slowed to its lowest rate in three decades.
 Chinese officials were initially mystified by Trump's unconventional style, and
Xi is said to have faced criticism
for underestimating Trump's resolve to tackle China's trading practices.
But emerging last week from this year's Communist Party confab at the beach resort of Beidaihe, China's leadership appears to have decided to hunker down.

""What's the point of calling Xi Jinping 'a good friend' and 'a great leader' but still increasing tariffs?"" asked Yao Xinchao, a trade professor at the University of International Business and Economics. ""He's a 70-ish-year-old man but speaks like a 7-year-old kid. We just can't listen to what he says now. I think Chinese leaders have realized this, too.""
Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at Renmin University of China, shares a similarly disdainful view. ""He is a real estate developer; he is a profiteer in the eyes of the Chinese people,"" he said. 
But the bottom line remains that China, which is experiencing a marked economic slowdown, wants a deal.
""The trade dispute between China and the U.S. should be resolved through dialogue and consultations,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday, adding that the United States' ""maximum-pressure approach hurts both sides and is not in the least constructive.""
""We hope that the U.S. can exercise restraint, return to reason, and demonstrate sincerity in order to facilitate further consultations on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefits,"" Geng said.
The question now is how the two sides find a way out of the standoff.
Wei Jianguo, a former vice minister of commerce, said Trump's strategy of browbeating
countries such as Canada, Mexico and Japan into making a deal will not work with China. ""We have seen and understand Trump's style,"" Wei said. ""If he thinks he can secure an advantage for the U.S. and wear China down by exerting various kinds of extreme pressure, he's dreaming. It's impossible.""
The longer this pattern continues, the more China becomes concerned that any deal won't stick.
""Now China understands him thoroughly and knows that inconsistency is his nature,"" said Wang, of Renmin University. ""Even if an agreement is signed, he may not implement it well. But, without an agreement, he does this over and over again, which is also very annoying.""
Many analysts expect the dispute to continue to at least November, when the two leaders are likely to meet at a summit of Pacific Rim nations in Chile.
Xi, meanwhile, confronts domestic political challenges that are likely to reduce his willingness to make concessions under foreign pressure. Authorities in Beijing face a growing crisis in Hong Kong, where protests aimed at preserving the city's special status continue, and are preoccupied by preparations to celebrate in early October the politically charged 70th anniversary of the Communist Party's takeover of China.

"Chinese general's speech, army video send warning to Hong Kong protesters","BEIJING - The top Chinese military official in Hong Kong has called the violent protests of recent weeks ""absolutely intolerable,"" in a threatening speech that coincides with the release of an extraordinary video showing Chinese soldiers practicing firing on demonstrators.
Together, the speech and the video served as a thinly veiled warning to the protesters in Hong Kong that China's patience is growing thin and that it is becoming increasingly willing to use force to quell the demonstrations in the semiautonomous territory.
""We resolutely support the action to maintain Hong Kong's rule of law by the people who love the nation and the city, and we are determined to protect national sovereignty, security, stability and the prosperity of Hong Kong,"" said Maj. Gen. Chen Daoxiang, commander of the People's Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong.
He described the demonstrations, which have continued for eight consecutive weekends, as ""absolutely intolerable."" 
The protests began as demonstrations against an extradition bill but have morphed into wider calls for democracy.
The demonstrations have turned violent at times and have become increasingly disruptive, but protesters have vowed to continue agitating for greater rights and fewer restrictions imposed by Beijing.
Chen made the remarks at a reception in Hong Kong on Wednesday night to mark the 92nd anniversary of the PLA's founding, which fell on Thursday. Carrie Lam, the Beijing-backed chief executive of Hong Kong, attended the event.
""The incidents have seriously threatened the life and safety of Hong Kong citizens and violated the bottom line of 'one country, two systems,' "" Chen said, referring to the principle that Hong Kong is supposed to enjoy a high degree of autonomy from China.
At the same time, the Hong Kong garrison released a provocative video on its Weibo microblogging page that showed soldiers shouting into a loudspeaker in Cantonese, the language spoken in Hong Kong: ""At your own peril!""
The soldiers, dressed in combat gear and holding shields, march forward and fire warning shots to disperse a pretend crowd in the streets. Some of the soldiers are carrying red banners that read, in English and Chinese, ""Stop charging, or we use force.""
The caption on the video says: ""The PLA's Hong Kong Garrison is an important embodiment of China's national sovereignty, a vital force of safeguarding the 'One Country, Two Systems,' and a cornerstone in maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. What we have been doing is preparing for war, training hard on enemy-killing skills, and keep our weapons ready and always ready to attack!"" 
The foreign minister of Taiwan, Jaushieh Joseph Wu, wrote on Twitter that ""Beijing is celebrating Armed Forces Day in a most uncivilized fashion."" 
""The people of #HongKong are gifted a video of vile threats! The PLA is supposed to protect the people, not pound them into submission. It's time for authoritarian China to back off!"" Wu wrote in remarks that were sure to antagonize Beijing.
The Communist Party views Taiwan as a renegade province that belongs to China. Beijing has been making its unhappiness with the island's independence-minded government increasingly clear in recent days, especially as Taiwan and the Hong Kong protesters appear to band together in the name of democracy.Asked how the world should interpret the video, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said people should ""go ask the military."" 
She added, ""We believe the PLA garrison in Hong Kong will continue to be the anchor for stability and prosperity in Hong Kong.""

Separately, about 190,000 armed police officers have been conducting summer drills in Guangdong, the southern Chinese province bordering Hong Kong, in exercises designed to prepare for National Day celebrations to be held in October that honor the country's founding. The exercises involved armored vehicles and helicopters.
Although the drills are not unusual, the location is. 
Analysts noted that the celebrations will be concentrated in Beijing, in the north of the country, and that the soldiers began their drills by swearing to increase security in the days leading up to the grand parade in Beijing.

"In Hong Kong, no heroes or martyrs","HONG KONG - As midnight approached on a decisive evening this week, protesters had paralyzed Hong Kong's airport, but their movement itself was encountering turbulence.
Negative headlines about the airport seizure led international news. A frenzied mob effectively took two Chinese men hostage, ignoring pleas for restraint in the crowd, and then bickered among themselves about what to do. Clashes with riot police left a haze of pepper spray at the door of one of the world's most vital transit hubs.
Protesters who have carefully curated their image - they're known for clearing pathways for ambulances and for leaving civilian property untouched - sensed a defining moment for their movement, whose adherents say they are in the fight of their lives defending Hong Kong's freedoms and autonomy against the mighty Chinese Communist Party. Now, they risked being branded as thugs, extremists and radicals.
A group of 70 protesters, motivated by an outpouring of posts on a Reddit-like chat forum, were among the first to step in to handle the image crisis. By dawn on Wednesday, they decided what was needed: They would apologize to the world.
Throughout the summer, a distinctive feature of the protests, sparked by a proposal to allow extraditions to mainland China, has been their lack of visible leadership - small factions organizing their own rallies, others setting up media groups, donating supplies, lending expertise on how to extinguish tear gas. Strategies and mobilization have been openly discussed and voted upon by tens of thousands of people on LIHKG.com, a messaging board, and chats on the encrypted messaging app Telegram have directed demonstrators based on crowdsourced information at rallies.
More recently, however, as protests have entered an uncertain new phase, a few influential groups of coordinators have emerged to subtly steer a movement that otherwise lacks a nucleus.
Distinct groups drive action
One of these influential groups, whose activities pieced together through recruitment ads, public statements and interviews with members and other protesters, is made up of about 1,000 contributors who analyze popular sentiment on the forum and communicate their consensus to the world through masked representatives and social media pamphleteering.
The result, researchers of the Hong Kong movement say, is an almost platonic ideal of an Internet-driven movement: democratic, transparent, anonymous, without heroes or martyrs.
""You see the emergence of the truly decentralized, networked movement,"" said Edmund Cheng, a professor of politics at Hong Kong Baptist University whose research group has interviewed 6,600 protesters this year. ""We have to invent a new word for it. It's closer to the ideal form than anything we've seen so far.""
The phenomenon is characteristic of a city with a 90 percent Internet-penetration rate - 95 percent of users access the Web with mobile phones - but also of its political dynamics, Cheng said. Unlike the Arab Spring or Ukraine's pro-Western uprising in 2014, local authorities have not shut down Internet access to cripple communications.
Activists' tactics also have fueled a riskier approach by authorities and the police that differs from a pro-democracy uprising five years ago. Where authorities homed in on the leaders of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, eventually jailing them, their response this time has been to treat everyone as a provocateur. This blanket approach has led to huge numbers of arrests and the liberal use of tear gas by police, even in residential areas.
After police again declined to authorize marches planned for this weekend, many activists say they are worried about a sharp escalation in force. Online forums in recent days have lit up with discussion about how to deal with the increasing numbers of undercover officers dressed like protesters, a tactic authorities have acknowledged.
Chinese state media have been baying for ever-tougher measures to quash the dissent, pointing to the assembly of armed police just across the border from Hong Kong. Nationalist tabloid Global Times tweeted an editorial that said forceful Chinese intervention was clearly an option.

As demonstrations have devolved into running street skirmishes over the past two months, volunteer groups have created websites that aggregate video streams from news outlets and digital maps that show the location of police formations and exit routes, in case protesters are trapped by charging riot squads. Large groups on Telegram issue time-stamped updates to tens of thousands of users about where police have been sighted and where they are firing tear gas.
One protester, Gigi, who like many demonstrators gave only one name to protect her identity, said she does not plan where she joins each protest. ""Depending on the information that is given ad hoc on Telegram channels or LIHKG.com, then I decide where and what time to join.""
Online debate spurs apology
The flat, digitally driven structure contrasts with the 2014 protests, when leading figures such as Hong Kong University law professor Benny Tai and Joshua Wong, then a high school student, dominated megaphones and delivered speeches at a stage in central Hong Kong.
In June, as protesters lay siege to the police headquarters, Wong took to a megaphone again. But this time, many protesters seemed to pay more attention to their smartphones than to the icon of the 2014 movement who went to jail in 2017 for his activism, said Antony Dapiran, the author of ""City of Protest.""
""There was a widespread feeling people didn't like others onstage giving directions,"" said Bonnie Leung, an organizer of the Civil Human Rights Front, a group that has organized logistics for massive parades this year but has otherwise avoided assuming any authority or leadership.
The 2014 protests were fractured by infighting between nonviolent demonstrators called the ""wo lei fei"" - meaning peace, reason, nonviolence - and militant radicals nicknamed ""braves."" This year, there is a consensus that the movement's various wings should resolve differences on chat platforms and refrain from descending into public, internecine conflict, Leung said.
As chaos unfolded at the airport Tuesday night, LIHKG, the Cantonese-language hub for protesters' chatter, erupted with concern in real-time about the wisdom of blocking passengers from boarding flights and, later, holding hostages.
Some resisted an apology because it would cast the movement as in the wrong, but a consensus emerged that the protesters faced an image problem. ""If we don't do public relations, we're dead!"" said one poster, as others began seeking people knowledgeable in French, Korean and Japanese to draft multilingual apologies.
Hui Fung Chung, a researcher in the Baptist University group, said LIHKG offered a real-time glimpse into the amorphous movement's thinking as they upvoted (or ""pushed"") viewpoints One apology thread received 4,000 pushes.
""The deliberation is actually nearly simultaneous with what's happening in the airport,"" Hui said.
As the public debate unfolded Tuesday, heated deliberations raged in private Telegram groups to which more active members attached themselves.

Michelle, 25, who is part of a 6,000-strong group that mostly handles Chinese and English publicity for the movement, said her group deliberated for hours, starting at midnight, to verify photos and videos from the standoff and debunk disinformation before they agreed to issue an apology.
By 6 a.m. Wednesday, some members began drafting the basic statement, while others were tasked with translation, proofreading and graphic design to make an image that would be shared on social media.
Rita, an administrator of the Guardians of Hong Kong, a collection of about 70 people that broadcasts news in English on Twitter as well as a popular Telegram channel, said her group was also gripped by heated disputes. But members agreed to support the apology when they saw letters emerge from other groups and a majority view on public forums, she said.
""It is a leader-full movement,"" said Johnson Yeung, an activist who was arrested at a protest last month. ""There are so many movement centers in this movement. Each different center of movement consists of several [areas of] expertise, and they will suggest strategies that will contribute to the larger goal.""
Different loosely organized ""cells,"" for instance, offer legal or public relations expertise, Yeung said.
Secret club at core
One of the most authoritative groups has been a secretive ""citizens"" club that has held several news conferences this month At each event, the group puts forward a different panel of masked speaker
netizens on LIHKG.
The citizens group members were among those who issued apologies this week for ""radical"" actions at the airport.
The group, which consists of about 50 to 60 core members, recently started using algorithms to gauge sentiment on online forums, said a 23-year-old who spoke at a Thursday news conference and asked to be identified as Mr. Kam.
Although the group tries to accurately convey the movement's sentiments, its rotating spokespeople acknowledge that their group cannot be the definitive voice for thousands of people.
""We cannot be a representative of every protester, for example, about the apology,"" said one masked spokesmen who gave his name on Thursday as David Ho. ""It is normal to have arguments about these issues.""
Several researchers said the citizens club appeared to be the closest the movement had to a core.
""They are, if not the actual core, then very close to it,"" said Claudia Mo, a leading opposition figure and pro-democracy lawmaker.

Although the movement apologized this week for affecting civilians, Mo said there seemed to be a greater tolerance for clashing with police in this leaderless, online-driven uprising compared with 2014, when the protest leadership disavowed violence.
""All Hong Kongers know the fact that it's thanks to the violent or radical young that the extradition bill is actually dead now,"" she said ""The Umbrella Movement petered out. But this time they're fighting for their future; they're fighting the way they want to fight.""
As the movement looks toward this weekend, when clashes with police are widely expected, radical ""braves"" on LIHKG have debated whether to establish a code called ""militant rules."" One post recommended that everyone agree not to hit journalists, paramedics and civilians. If somebody catches a suspected undercover spy, they should alert people on Telegram immediately.
""If we're fighting a war, then troops must prioritize discipline,"" said the post, which received 5,700 pushes. ""One or two numskulls can destroy the whole movement.""

A protester wears a mock eye patch as protesters occupy Hong Kong International Airport earlier this week. The patches are a reference to a woman who was shot in the eye, probably with a beanbag round, during a clash with police last weekend."
"Amid demonstrations in Hong Kong, a familiar Broadway refrain is heard","More than thousand HKers sing Les Miserables' 'Do you hear the people sing?' at HK international airport with their calls for free election and democracy. Here is the Ground Zero in the war against authoritarian rule. That's the reason for us never surrender. pic.twitter.com/1MkTp4BkVg— Joshua Wong 黃之鋒 (@joshuawongcf) August 10, 2019 "">
Amid the cacophony of the demonstrations being staged this week in Hong Kong, one could hear an unmistakable reverb from a far-off domain: Broadway.
Yes, the song that rang out across the region, including in a terminal of Hong Kong International Airport, was, of all things, a show tune. In a video recorded during the airport protest Friday, hundreds of demonstrators can be seen participating in a sit-down and heard singing and clapping to an a cappella version of ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"" from the 1987 blockbuster Broadway musical ""Les Misérables."" The protest, which shut down airport operations for a second day Tuesday, began as a demonstration against the use of police force in an earlier mass public protest. That was sparked by a proposal to permit extraditions from the former British colony to mainland China.
The musical interlude seemed a notable peaceful moment, even as the confrontation between demonstrators and riot police turned more violent late Tuesday. And the meaningfulness was not because the words of the song, by ""Les Miz"" composer Claude-Michel Shönberg and lyricist Herbert Kretzmer, manage to find a resonance in the public outcry in China in 2019:

Do you hear the people sing? Singing the song of angry men,


It is the music of a people who will not be slaves again.


When the beating of your heart echoes the beating of the drums,


There is a life about to start when tomorrow comes.

For those well-acquainted with the show, it also underlined the power of the musical's global reach, expanded by social media, three decades of international tours and a hit 2012 motion picture version. The song is introduced late in the first act by the Parisian students who raise barricades in the streets in revolt against French authorities. In the musical - based on Victor Hugo's historical novel of the same title - sad to say, the revolt eventually is put down. Nevertheless, ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"" has been invoked in political demonstrations around the world in recent years. It's gone from applause generator in playhouses to emotion-stoking anthem for grass-roots movements.
In the well-sung rendition by the airport chorus, you get whiffs of defiance and altruism, values embodied by the number itself. Of course the full version foreshadows darker events: ""The blood of the martyrs will water the meadows of France!"" the song declares. Although the lyric that seems to echo most vibrantly remains that one about the life about to start, when tomorrow comes. For these protesters, it is presumably not the tragic dimension of ""Les Miz"" that beckons them - it's the resilience of the underdog.

"Xi's choice: Destroy Trump, or weaken America","Like Mel Brooks as the king of France, it's good to be Xi Jinping. Or so you might think. The man is the undisputed ruler of the world's most populous nation,
the autocrat at the top of a one-party state that controls the second-largest economy in the world.
His nation's principal rival for global influence appears to have given up on statecraft in favor of government by temper tantrum.

But life's getting tougher for the chairman, or so it seems from here. Xi has set for China the goal of becoming the most powerful nation on Earth. But that entails learning to employ tools of power that aren't yet on his belt.
I'm talking about soft power - the use of international organizations, moral suasion, foreign aid, trade, compromise, alliances and salesmanship to achieve a nation's aims. Brutally adept with hard power - from tanks and machine guns to concentration camps and starvation - the Chinese Communist Party has little experience with soft power. Xi is getting a crash course, with one test after another.
Hong Kong is the most immediate. More than 20 years after the former British colony was returned to Chinese sovereignty, the proud and wealthy city refuses to submit to Communist control. A law that would allow Beijing authorities to extradite dissidents from Hong Kong provoked a backlash of protest that grows larger with each effort to quell it. Close to 2 million people, according to organizers, participated in a peaceful demonstration on Sunday - arguably the biggest challenge to party authority since the 1989 student protest in Beijing, which ended in a massacre.
Though members of a Chinese paramilitary police force are massing on ground adjacent to Hong Kong, use of hard power to end the protests would be a serious mistake. The integration of Hong Kong is not a discrete exercise for China. Rather, it is the first test of China's ability to exert decisive influence with its neighbors. Other nations of Asia, Europe and Africa are unlikely to welcome Chinese outreach if they know that Beijing's only response to disagreement is violence.
There's also the internal question. China's tremendous economic growth in the 30 years since Tiananmen Square has created tens of millions of rich and middle-class individuals. Would the wealthy and worldly citizens of Shanghai, for example, acquiesce in the violent oppression of Hong Kong? Ditto Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and other newly rich cities. China's strategy to reabsorb capitalist Taiwan peacefully someday would suffer a terrible blow if the Hong Kong experiment were to fail.
No nation is ready for global power that can't amicably coexist with a wealthy city under its control. The extradition law was a massive blunder by a domestic tyrant and demands a skillful, soft-power solution.
Xi's finesse is also being tested in western China, where overreliance on hard power has created an archipelago of concentration camps housing more than 1 million Uighur men, women and children. China's oppression of this Muslim minority surely encouraged Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government in revoking the special status of the nearby disputed territory of Kashmir and embarking on a Muslim oppression of his own.

It is difficult to see how an emboldened and unquiet India is anything but bad for China's long-term ambitions. The two mega-nations are natural rivals, but it is better to compete with a peaceful and law-abiding neighbor than with a reckless and belligerent one. A leader adept at soft power would set that example.
Finally, Xi faces a test regarding President Trump.
Whatever one thinks of Trump's trade-war goals, his tactics appear to have left him at Xi's mercy. The Chinese people - 60 percent of whom spend less than $10 a day
- are far more accustomed to economic pain than Trump's Americans, and they have no meaningful right to vote. So Xi can probably afford to absorb the economic pain necessary to push the trade war past Election Day. This would greatly increase the chance of a recession in 2020 and damage the American president's chance of reelection.
On the other hand, Xi also has the power to make a few token concessions that would allow Trump to claim victory in the trade war. Markets would give a hearty cheer; Trump would crown himself the China slayer. But Xi might gain four more years of severe disruption in the West.
The hard-power choice here is probably to stay the course on trade negotiations, spreading the pain unevenly and disproportionately on China's impoverished majority. In the People's Republic, it's always the people who suffer. Confronting a U.S. president and potentially ending his career would ratify China's arrival at superpower status.

Yet Xi may stand to gain more from the soft-power play, graciously springing Trump from the trap he stepped in. Trump's reelection would gratify his supporters and demoralize everyone else, further depleting the soft power of the United States. It's shocking that a U.S. president has given such juicy options to the Chinese leader. We'll learn how canny Xi is by the choice he makes.

Inside TikTok: A culture clash where U.S. views about censorship often were overridden by the Chinese bosses,"The wildly popular short-video app TikTok has become one of the world's fastest-growing social media platforms, known for its quirky memes and viral singalongs. But its happy-go-lucky rise was largely shaped by its Beijing-based parent company, which imposed strict rules on what could appear on the app in keeping with China's restrictive view of acceptable speech.
Following those rules often sparked clashes within the organization, former U.S. employees of the company told The Washington Post. American workers, accustomed to unrestrained expression online, bristled at commands to restrict videos that Beijing-based teams had deemed subversive or controversial, including heavy kissing, heated debates and the kinds of political discussions seen widely across the Web.
TikTok says its U.S. operation doesn't censor political content or take instructions from its parent company, the Chinese tech giant ByteDance. Company leaders extol the app as a platform free of the contentious content that has come to characterize its online competitors, such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. ByteDance said no moderators for TikTok's U.S. platform are based in China.
But former U.S. employees said moderators based in Beijing had the final call on whether flagged videos were approved. The former employees said their attempts to persuade Chinese teams not to block or penalize certain videos were routinely ignored, out of caution about the Chinese government's restrictions and previous penalties on other ByteDance apps.
Beijing's potential influence over the app in the United States has led the Treasury Department's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to review the deal that brought TikTok's forerunner, Musical.ly, under ByteDance's control. Lawmakers have urged U.S. officials to investigate what they called ""a potential counterintelligence threat we cannot ignore.""
Top TikTok executives declined to be interviewed for this article. In written responses to questions, company leaders acknowledged early stumbles and touted recent efforts earlier this year to increase U.S. hiring, update content moderation rules and fortify the U.S. team's independence from its Chinese owners.
""TikTok has grown quickly, much like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat grew during their early years,"" said Vanessa Pappas, the company's U.S. general manager. ""And like those platforms, growth has posed challenges in terms of making sure our policies and practices keep up.""
The short-video app has become a global phenomenon and taken young American audiences by storm, blending silly jokes, stunts and personal stories into a tech powerhouse downloaded more than 1.3 billion times worldwide.
The company attracted little official attention in Washington as it sailed to the top of U.S. app stores, a rare corner of the Internet where lighthearted entertainment, not bitter political discussion, dominates.
But former employees who worked in the company's U.S. offices as recently as this spring said they were instructed to follow rules set by managers at ByteDance's Beijing headquarters. The Post talked to six since-departed workers who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.
""They want to be a global company, and numbers-wise, they've had that success,"" said one former ByteDance manager who left this year. ""But the purse is still in China: The money always comes from there, and the decisions all come from there.""
Pappas, a former YouTube official who joined the company earlier this year, said in a statement that decisions about which videos to promote or remove ""are not directed by any foreign government, including the Chinese government.""
Of former employees' experiences with strict rules set in Beijing, Pappas said, ""We initially took a 'one-size-fits-all' approach and quickly realized that this wouldn't work.""
Her California-based team is now managing the U.S. market, she added, ""and the company understands they can best do so without executives 10,000 miles away involving themselves in their decisions.""
Concerns about TikTok are aggravated by the fact that it is far less transparent than its peers in Silicon Valley. The company has long stayed silent about its policies, offering little detail about how the app presents an endless buffet of visual candy - and where the company draws the line on content it deems inappropriate.
TikTok provides no data about the videos it has removed from the app, and it shares no details about the artificial-intelligence tools that determine what viewers see. That secrecy also has contributed to keeping the company out of international organizations that might serve as key forums for oversight of censorship, harmful content and other digital ills.
Facing scrutiny for its privacy practices, TikTok in July retained consultants at the cybersecurity firm Special Counsel to analyze the app's source code and data-storage practices. Doug Brush, a vice president for Special Counsel, said Monday that his team discovered some ""low-risk vulnerabilities"" but that there was ""no indication"" that the Chinese government accessed TikTok users' data. Brush said that ByteDance committed to paying his firm an undisclosed amount in consulting fees, and that a fuller report of the consultants' findings was not yet ready for review.
 Alex Stamos, the director of the Stanford Internet Observatory and a former chief security officer at Facebook, said there are ""legitimate concerns"" about the potential for user censorship and surveillance on TikTok, especially because the app has grown significantly among young users.
The company ""is operating under a political censorship regime,"" he said, and ""the Chinese government has no problem telling [its companies] where they should come down in political debates.""
ByteDance executives said TikTok stores all U.S. user data in Virginia and Singapore. But Stamos said where the data is stored is ""pretty much irrelevant"": ""The leverage the government has over the people who have access to that data, that's what's relevant.""
ByteDance bought the popular karaoke app Musical.ly in 2017 and merged it with its own service under the TikTok name last year. Led by Zhang Yiming, one of China's richest men, ByteDance runs a stable of news and entertainment apps worldwide, including the popular U.S. news aggregation app TopBuzz. ByteDance is worth about $75 billion, making it more valuable than the tech companies Uber and Snapchat combined.
TikTok has been downloaded more than 120 million times in the United States, and it has regularly outranked its top competitors, Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram, on the Apple and Google app stores, according to data from research firm Sensor Tower. The research firm Ghost Data, conducting an analysis of millions of accounts for The Post, found that TikTok is quickly becoming a major rival to Instagram: Users with followings in the thousands appear to watch and interact with content more than similar users on Instagram, and TikTok is becoming competitive even among the influencer set. It was one of many factors that led Andrea Stroppa and fellow researchers to write that ""it is too early to simply dismiss TikTok as [a] passing fad.""
To handle exploding demand in the United States, the company hired a new head of U.S. moderation in April and has in recent months embarked on a hiring blitz, pursuing dozens of new engineers, strategists and executives for its offices in New York, Los Angeles and Palo Alto, Calif.
ByteDance said the TikTok organization in the United States is independent from China. But Pappas told The Post that her boss, Musical.ly co-founder Alex Zhu, reports directly to Yiming, ByteDance's founder. In a statement, Pappas said, ""Alex has been clear that my team and I have a large degree of autonomy, and full autonomy on decisions like content moderation.""
The company has also staffed up in Washington. TikTok announced last month that it would retain two former members of Congress as part of a broader effort to revise its content moderation policies and fend off political controversy. ByteDance also registered its first federal lobbyists earlier this year.
But TikTok at times has found itself isolated from its Silicon Valley counterparts Facebook, Google and Twitter, which have banded together to try to combat their platforms' thorniest problems.
Unlike the three tech giants, for example, TikTok and ByteDance aren't part of an international effort that aims to combat extremism online. The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT) has helped social media companies identify violent videos around major international incidents and stop their spread online in real time.
TikTok said it had met with GIFCT leaders. But the company has not been granted membership because it does not meet the group's criteria, which require companies to meet certain conditions on human rights and to publish transparency reports, according to a source familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the private proceedings. In practice, that means TikTok cannot easily access real-time information about extremist content going viral.
Nor are ByteDance and TikTok participants in the Global Network Initiative, a collection of companies that have pledged to resist unlawful or overly broad requests from governments to access user data, the group confirmed. The GNI does annual checkups of its members, including Facebook and Google, to ensure they're keeping their promises. No such oversight exists of TikTok, and fears run high that the Chinese government can access U.S. users' data despite the company's insistence otherwise.
Unlike its Western social media rivals, TikTok is strikingly light on the political and social topics that much of the world is commenting on - including, as some researchers told The Post in September, a dearth of content related to the Hong Kong protests that China has fiercely fought to undermine. As the company has shifted its moderation rules and gained new prominence, some notable exceptions have emerged: Videos with the #trump2020 hashtag, for instance, have more than 200 million views.
Former employees who spoke with The Post said they struggled with cultural conflicts, shifting guidelines and inconsistencies in how TikTok handled content for U.S. audiences. The former workers said they often felt subordinate to their Chinese managers and co-workers, who followed different rules of acceptable speech and often declined to explain why they had blocked certain videos or ideas.
Some said they grew concerned after being told to flag videos deemed potentially culturally problematic, even if the content was generally acceptable in the United States. Videos including heavy kissing or more suggestive dance moves, for instance, were to be marked ""vulgar"" and blocked from younger viewers, some former moderators said. And political content - even if it included constructive discussion, and didn't touch on China-related topics - was also restricted in case it contained inflammatory talk or controversy.
Rules handed down from Beijing-based teams often inspired confusion in the U.S. office, former employees said. Moderators, for instance, were told to restrict any videos showing a person vaping normally, out of health concerns, but to allow the ""vaping tricks"" that had fueled a viral meme.
Similar concerns about the influence of Chinese managers played out at ByteDance's news aggregation app TopBuzz, which former U.S.-based employees said blocked any critical discussion of China. They were also instructed to block or remove posts including profanity, discussion of legal marijuana and the artwork of Georgia O'Keeffe, whose flower paintings have been famously compared to female genitalia.
""This is indicative of a growing phenomenon of Chinese tech companies going global,"" said Elsa B. Kania, an adjunct senior fellow and China researcher at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank. ""For all of their international aspirations, they are expected to adhere to the requirements of the Communist Party, including demands of censorship.""

Unexpected good news on democracy,"By now it's old news that the world is living through a retreat of democracy. For a dozen consecutive years, the number of countries where liberty has declined has exceeded those where it has expanded, according to Freedom House. Autocrats are stepping up repression; populist movements are rising in Europe and the United States. China and Russia are offering new models of high-tech dictatorship.
The drift augurs ill for human governance in the 21st century. That's why it's encouraging that an unexpected and underreported counter-trend has appeared in the summer of 2019. Mass movements of people resisting the new authoritarianism have been popping up across the world.
In Hong Kong, the largest demonstrations since the restoration of Chinese sovereignty in 1997 have rocked the city, forcing authorities to withdraw legislation that would have critically weakened the rule of law. In Central and Eastern Europe, a host of countries have seen huge anti-government protests aimed at corruption or creeping authoritarianism. And in Africa, persistent pro-democracy street movements have continued in Sudan and Algeria even after the ousters of their entrenched rulers.
 

True, decisive results so far have been limited.
This month, the Sudanese military signed a deal with civilian groups setting up a joint governing council and laying out a three-year transition to democracy. But the military will rule for the first 21 months, and many suspect it will seek to derail the process. Algerian protesters are demanding free elections in six months, but their generals remain resistant.
Following popular protests, Moldova and Slovakia have new leaders committed to rooting out criminality, and Romania's once-dominant politician has been sent to prison. But demonstrations demanding the removal of corrupt and thuggish governments in the Czech Republic and Georgia have yet to succeed. Though Hong Kong's Civil Human Rights Front has forced a tactical retreat by the Chinese regime of Xi Jinping, its longer-term prospects look cloudy at best.
What all this means, according to Larry Diamond, a Stanford University scholar who studies democracy, is that ""we are perched at a volatile and possibly historic moment"" - and much depends on how the United States and other established democracies respond. ""Forthright rhetoric and vigorous diplomatic and aid engagement could tip some of these countries [back] in a democratic direction,"" he told me. ""But if what autocrats see is Western apathy or pure realpolitik, they will judge that they have plenty of space to get as nasty as they need to.""
So far the U.S. record has been mixed: It depends on whether President Trump, a reliable friend to strongmen and populists, has weighed in. Where he hasn't, as in Sudan and Moldova, U.S. envoys have played a positive role. One joined with other outside powers in inducing the Sudanese army to accept the power-sharing deal with the civilian opposition. Another helped persuade Moldova's dominant oligarch to swallow a reformist government determined to break his hold on the judiciary and electoral system.
In Hong Kong, on the other hand, a plan by the outgoing U.S. consul to deliver a speech in support of the protest movement was squelched by the State Department. According to the Financial Times, Trump promised Xi at their meeting in Osaka, Japan, last month that he would keep quiet about Hong Kong while the two pursued a trade agreement.

Diamond has just published a new book chronicling ""the rise of illiberal, anti-immigrant populist movements in Europe and the United States; the steady decline in the quality of American democracy; and the surge in global power of Russia and China, which are avidly undermining democracies and liberal values around the world."" Much of it is depressing reading.
But Diamond also reports encouraging data on whether people are losing faith in democracy. The short answer is that they are not. In recent surveys, 69 percent of respondents in Latin American countries, 89 percent in East Asia, 72 percent in Africa and 81 percent of Middle Eastern Arabs agreed with some version of the Winston Churchill-inspired precept that democracy might have its problems, but it's still the best form of government.
That helps to explain what has happened this summer. It turns out that large numbers of people around the world still want democracy enough to take to the streets to demand it. The problem in those places lies not in popular will
but in established democratic governments, which more often than not these days are unwilling to defend freedom elsewhere. 
The retreat by the United States matters most. ""We can get lucky and see some countries beating back autocracy, even in the absence of our help and encouragement,"" says Diamond. But while Trump is president, the democratic recession is likely to continue.

"Hong Kong protesters allege beatings, torture at the hands of city's police","Amnesty report calls for probe into use of force, cites 'pattern' of abuse
HONG KONG - When lawyer Hermes Chan visited a 19-year-old client in the hospital last month, he found her lying limp in bed under police watch. Bruises covered her arms, knees and shins like patchwork.
The young woman had been fleeing from riot police, Chan said, after an unauthorized protest Aug. 11. As she and dozens of others rushed into a subway station to head home, police fired pepper-spray balls from close range. An officer grabbed her by the collar, yanking her upward so that her back was exposed, before pushing her to the floor and pummeling her.
""The beating didn't stop even when she was arrested,"" Chan said in an interview, adding that his client was initially charged with unlawful assembly. A local news video capturing the melee shows groups of officers grabbing protesters and thumping them with batons.

The clash was one of many over Hong Kong's summer of unrest to have fueled concerns about police use of force. The city's leader has refused to allow an independent investigation into police actions, a chief reason demonstrators have taken to the streets over successive weeks to call for greater accountability, among other demands.
Chan said that when he tried to reach his client the day after her arrest, officers refused to put him through. She was ultimately released within 36 hours.
A report from Amnesty International, released Friday local time, suggests that the woman's experience is part of an ""alarming pattern"" of ""reckless and indiscriminate"" tactics employed by Hong Kong's police, who have stepped up their use of force since June as unrest in the semiautonomous Chinese territory has snowballed.
Amnesty's report, based on interviews with nearly two dozen arrested people, offers evidence of torture and other mistreatment of protesters in police detention. One man detained at a police station after a protest told Amnesty that officers took him to a separate room when he refused to answer a question, beat him severely and threatened to break his hands.
""I felt the pain in my bones and couldn't breathe. I tried to shout but I couldn't breathe and couldn't talk,"" the man said, according to the rights group's report.
""Given the pervasiveness of the abuses we found, it is clear that the Hong Kong police force is no longer in a position to investigate itself and remedy the widespread unlawful suppression of protesters,"" said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty's East Asia director, stressing the need for an independent inquiry.


A spokesman for the Hong Kong police, in emailed comments to The Washington Post, said the police respect ""the privacy, dignity and rights of the person under police custody and have a set of standard procedures in handling the person in police custody."" 
Detainees in need of medical attention are brought to the nearest clinic or hospital, the spokesman added.
In response to questions on Chan's client, the spokesman said that police ""do not comment on individual cases"" and that anyone who feels aggrieved about their treatment can ""lodge a complaint through the existing well established mechanism.""Hong Kong's government and police force are now in uncharted waters - facing not only the ire of their people, but also that of human rights groups known for exposing violations worldwide, as well as the United Nations. U.N. experts last week condemned the excessive use of force by law enforcement officials.
Hong Kong police have arrested almost 1,500 people over the course of the demonstrations. Yet the arrests and bans on large assemblies have not stopped people from taking to the streets. Protesters are planning civil disobedience actions on Oct. 1, the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China's founding.

Throughout the crisis, police have defended their use of force as appropriate and effective. They point out that protesters have been illegally occupying roads, vandalizing subway stations, assaulting officers and setting fires.
""We must bear in mind, with the intense and excessive violence used by rioters, everyone in society is a loser,"" Tse Chun-chung, chief superintendent of the police's public relations branch, said on Monday. ""Weeks after weeks and month after month, these radical protesters are tearing our society apart.""
Many residents, human rights groups, lawyers accuse the force of responding slowly and with restraint when pro-Beijing gangs have attacked protesters, while deploying overwhelming force against anti-government demonstrators.
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a longtime advocate for Hong Kong's autonomy, told a congressional hearing this week that pro-Beijing thugs associated with organized crime and the Communist Party's overseas influence operations had violently confronted demonstrators, journalists and passersby in recent months.
""And the police just looked on, looked the other way, and in some cases, even cooperated,"" he said.
 Congress is considering a bill that would seek to punish those who suppress the city's freedoms, and some lawmakers are pushing legislation that would ban the sale of riot-control equipment to Hong Kong police. Beijing's encroachment on the territory's freedoms also is expected to feature in discussions at the U.N. General Assembly this month.

"Twitter, Facebook act to curb China disinformation","Suspended accounts tied to Beijing efforts to sow discord in Hong Kong
Twitter and Facebook said Monday they had taken action against China for using hundreds of fake accounts to sow political discord during the Hong Kong protests, marking the first time the social media giants had identified Beijing directly for spearheading such an operation.
Twitter said it was suspending nearly a thousand Chinese accounts and banning advertising from state-owned media companies, citing a ""significant state-backed information operation"" related to protests in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, Facebook said it was removing five Facebook accounts, seven pages and three groups after being tipped off to the use of ""a number of deceptive tactics, including the use of fake accounts.""
The new takedowns by Facebook and Twitter reflect the extent to which disinformation has become a global scourge, far surpassing the once-secret efforts of Russian agents to stoke social unrest in the United States during the 2016 presidential election. Researchers recently have pointed to similar campaigns linked to Saudi Arabia, Israel, China, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela, efforts aimed at shaping discussions on social media beyond their borders.
""It's almost like wherever you look, you're finding this stuff,"" said Ben Nimmo, chief of investigations for Graphika, a network analysis firm based in New York that studies online disinformation.
Some of this activity has come under the auspices of state-controlled media. In August, for example, Facebook, Google and Twitter each identified a sprawling disinformation campaign originating out of Iran that posted content - and in some cases, purchased ads - in a bid to amplify accounts with ties to state news organizations.
Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Hundreds of thousands of protesters have been demonstrating for an autonomous Hong Kong over the past two months, including a peaceful march Sunday. Hong Kong police have deployed force, including in residential neighborhoods, and made more than 700 arrests to discourage further unrest. Protesters and pro-establishment groups have clashed violently. And Beijing has ramped up pressure.
Facebook said that the pages it removed had about 15,500 accounts following one or more, while 2,200 accounts joined at least one of the groups. The company said its investigation had found ""links to individuals associated with the Chinese government."" Though Facebook is not considering a ban of advertising from state-sponsored media, the company said it is working on additional transparency measures.
Twitter said that the new advertising policy released Monday was something that had been previously discussed internally. The company said in its blog post that state-backed news media accounts ""will be free to continue to use Twitter to engage in public conversation,"" just not its advertising products.
Twitter confronted a similar issue in 2016 after discovering that Russia Today, or RT, which the U.S. government has labeled a propaganda arm of the Kremlin, had purchased roughly $1.9 million in ads over an eight-year period. In late 2017, Twitter said it decided to cut advertising from all those accounts.
The accounts were part of a larger network of roughly 200,000 accounts that were proactively deleted before they were substantially active, Twitter said in a blog post. That's despite Twitter being blocked in China, the company added. Twitter said that the accounts it suspended were accessed from virtual private networks, or VPNs, or unblocked Internet protocol addresses originating from China.
""Overall, these accounts were deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong, including undermining the legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement on the ground,"" Twitter said in the blog post. ""Based on our intensive investigations, we have reliable evidence to support that this is a coordinated state-backed operation.""
About 448,000 people in Hong Kong use Twitter, according to the market research firm eMarketer. About 4.7 million people there log in to Facebook at least once a month.
Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, said he sees the Twitter and Facebook campaigns as ""a test case"" for China as they prepare for major events over the next year - such as the elections in Taiwan - for which information operations will be key.
Data released by Twitter on the deleted accounts revealed a number of users with large follower counts and a sometime-tenuous grasp of American culture and the English language. The fake accounts showed supposed locations in Las Vegas, Houston and Moscow.
One account with more than 181,000 followers, LibertyLionNews, advertised itself as: ""Conservative News from the USA and Abroad. #Catholic Defender of the Constitution of the United States. #Qanon #MAGA #BUILDTHEWALL #TRUMP #2A #1A."" Another account said it was a Columbus, Ohio-based ""coupon clipping, money saving, low key hustling super mom"" who lives ""in the suburbs"" but is ""from the hood."" Others were more abstract: ""I want a satrawberrie!"" the account ReStrawberries exclaimed.
The disinformation campaign pushed narratives praising the police, criticizing the protesters and blaming the unrest on Western forces, said Lee Foster, head of the intelligence team investigating information operations for FireEye, a cybersecurity firm based in California. He said that many of the accounts were relatively new and that at least some had previously been used for other online influence efforts.
""I wouldn't call this sophisticated,"" said Foster, who has been tracking the online campaign since protests started in June. ""Anybody actively looking for it would quickly find it.""

Several social media accounts appeared to mimic those of news organizations, possibly in hopes of having the tweets be seen as authentic reports on a fast-moving international story.
The use of English-language accounts is significant, said Laura Rosenberger, director of the German Marshall Fund's Alliance for Securing Democracy, which aims to expose foreign actors' efforts to undermine democracy. While it has long been known that the Chinese government has manipulated the information space within its borders, Monday's announcements show that the state is increasingly seeking to control information flow outside the country as well, she added, including potentially with those of Chinese descent in foreign countries.
""The question now is, who was this targeting?"" Rosenberger asked.

A 'hair's breadth from destruction',"HONG KONG

Physically diminutive, intellectually acerbic and with an eye for the ironic, Margaret Ng - lawyer, writer and former legislator - is, at 71, a member of the generation for which this city's youthful protesters have scant patience. They say the elders have been too patient about Hong Kong's precarious situation. But, says Ng dryly, the youths frequently welcome assistance from the older generation's lawyers. 
With her closely cropped gray hair and an obvious abundance of wisdom acquired from Hong Kong's many high-stakes controversies, Ng, who plainly states facts as she sees them through her round spectacles, resembles an owl with an attitude. She says Hong Kong's situation is ""desperate"": ""Under the veneer of a free city, we are under Beijing's control."" Today, the city is a ""hair's breadth from destruction."" She is particularly distressed by police violence, which is a departure from the professional policing bequeathed to this city from its last
three decades of colonial rule. Recently, the police have prevented, sometimes for hours, first-aid providers from attending to those the police have injured. The city government under Beijing's puppet,
Carrie Lam, is increasingly resorting to the policy Ng calls ""beat up, lock up and silence.""
Lam and her Beijing masters are learning that what Gen. Douglas MacArthur said of military disasters - that all are explained, in one way or another, by two words: ""too late"" - is also often true in politics. In April, Lam ignited a long, hot summer by refusing to amend an extradition bill that would have facilitated, by regularizing, Beijing's penchant for kidnapping into its Kafkaesque criminal justice system inconvenient Hong Kong booksellers and other affronts to totalitarianism. If Lam had promptly done what she has done five months too late - unambiguously withdrawn the bill - the protests might have dissipated. Instead, they have metastasized, as has the protesters' agenda, which now includes more meaningful suffrage - ending Beijing's role in approving candidates - and an independent review of police behavior. 
At a recent lunch at the Hong Kong Club, there were three generations of democracy advocates around a table seating eight. At one end of the age spectrum was Martin Lee Chu-ming, 81, the founding chairman of the city's principal pro-democracy party. At the other end was Joshua Wong, a prodigy of protesting who, given the stressful life he lives, might in a few years look as old as he now is (22). He was an organizer of the 2014 demonstrations against Beijing's truncation of popular sovereignty by stipulating those for whom Hong Kongers could vote.

The lunchtime gathering stressed that the agenda does not include independence for a sovereign Hong Kong. Lam and Beijing should, however, remember that events can generate their own logic: In the early 1770s, restive American colonists, chafing under some annoyances imposed by London, insisted that they sought only restoration of the status quo - enjoyment of their traditional British rights. But spilled blood - on Lexington Green, at a bridge in Concord
and elsewhere - quickly led to July 4, 1776. 
""Do you remember the Cheshire Cat?"" Ng asks, invoking the creature in ""Alice in Wonderland"" that in one scene slowly disappears, leaving nothing but its grin. Hong Kong could slowly disappear except for its veneer. Or quickly. ""Is [Beijing] prepared to kill Hong Kong?"" Ng asks. Young people here, ""who have nowhere else to go,"" increasingly think they have nothing to lose. Some of them ""carry their last wills in their pockets."" 
They know they are dealing, ultimately, with a regime that has swept at least 1 million Uighur Muslims into prisons and ""reeducation"" concentration camps. China's national anthem celebrates ""millions of hearts with one mind.""
Hong Kong's protesters are defending a society comfortable with many different minds. And they rightly have turned their anger against so-called
smart lampposts
- those likely adorned with facial- recognition technologies that serve policies of social control. 
Four decades ago, after President Richard M. Nixon's 1972 visit to China, and as Americans were beginning to travel there in significant numbers, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) tartly observed that too many returning Americans were more voluble about the absence of flies in modernizing China than about the absence of freedom. Now, however, thanks to the ongoing drama in Hong Kong's streets, it is possible to hope that the West has passed ""peak China"" - the apogee of blinkered admiration for a nation in which approximately 19 percent of the human race is saddled with one of the world's most sinister regimes.

"Trump, China attack press","President condemnsU.S. media as Xi orders more news sites blocked
The news out of China over the weekend was bleak: Two more major international media companies - the London-based Guardian and The Washington Post - were added to the nation's ""Great Firewall,"" blocked on the Internet to the country's 1.4 billion citizens as part of a crackdown on dissent by President Xi Jinping.
The ongoing fade-out of public information coincided with the 30th anniversary this month of the bloodshed of the Tiananmen Square protests, a free-speech demonstration that the Communist Party crushed with military force as the world watched in horror.
 Meanwhile, in Washington, President Trump had a message: The Post, CNN and NBC were, he wrote on Twitter, ""Fake and Corrupt News Media."" The New York Times and CNN are ""truly The Enemy of the People!"" MSNBC, which he called ""the opposition,"" was broadcasting ""such lies, almost everything they were saying was the opposite of the truth.""
""I know it is not at all 'Presidential' to hit back at the Corrupt Media, or people who work for the Corrupt Media, when they make false statements about me or the Trump Administration,"" Trump declared in another tweet. ""Problem is, if you don't hit back, people believe the Fake News is true. So we'll hit back!""
Trump's tweetstorm against the press corps over the past three days, apparently sparked by his belief that he was not getting enough credit for an immigration deal with Mexico, was nothing new. The incendiary words were so routine that the president, after discounting a Times story on the deal as ""false,"" took his motorcade to Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va., for five hours of rest and relaxation.
But the president's hostility toward the press in the United States again stood as a striking companion to the antagonism that authoritarian regimes display toward the free flow of information. Trump's tweets came as an estimated 1 million people in Hong Kong took to the streets to protest a new extradition law announced by the Communist Party, fearing further erosion of the one-country, two-systems autonomy that has existed since the British returned control of the island to Beijing in 1997.
""The fact that the president is willing to attack the media so explicitly and so directly makes it harder to point out and to stand up for those attacks in other parts of the world, including China,"" said Jeffrey Prescott, executive director of National Security Action, a think tank formed by former Obama administration officials to counter Trump's foreign policy.
White House officials did not respond to a request for comment.
The president's silence on China's abuse of free speech and human rights follows his relatively weak reactions to other abuses around the world, including the killing of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of Saudi Arabia. Trump said in February that he believed North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's claim that he did not have prior knowledge of the mistreatment of Otto Warmbier, an American college student who died days after being released, in a coma, from 17 months in captivity in 2017. 
Trump also has not spoken publicly about the ethnic violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar or the mass incarceration of more than 1 million Uighur Muslims in ""reeducation camps"" in China - leaving the job of publicly condemning those actions to his subordinates, including Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Last month, when two Reuters journalists were released after more than 500 days in government confinement in Myanmar over their reporting of the killing of the Rohingya, Pence and Pompeo hailed the news. A White House spokeswoman also released a statement. But Trump said not a word. The two journalists, who had been named with other journalists as Time magazine's ""Person of the Year"" in 2018, received the Pulitzer Prize for their work last month in New York.
The twin spectacles of Beijing clamping down on free speech and Trump ratcheting up his attacks on news organizations comes amid a growing trade war between the United States and China. 
While the White House has sought to force Beijing to commit to new measures aimed at preventing theft of American trade secrets, the president has failed to go to bat for the Western media companies that are unable to do business in China. 
Trump has given the signal to hawkish aides, including Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, to get tougher with Beijing, noted Daniel Russel, who served as a high-ranking Asia policy official in the Obama administration.
""But there's no reason to believe that's reflective of what President Trump believes in, and we've seen in the past when deals could be made that suit Trump's purpose, including with respect to the most egregious human rights violator, Kim Jong Un, Trump does not hesitate to undercut his own advisers,"" said Russel, now a vice president at the Asia Society.

U.S. stocks jump on reports that China is open to partial deal on global trade,"Stock markets climbed Wednesday amid new optimism that high-level trade talks set to resume this week might usher in a breakthrough in the year-long U.S.-China conflict.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 182 points, or 0.7 percent, after Bloomberg News reported that a Chinese official ""with direct knowledge of the talks"" said Beijing was open to a partial deal to limit the economic damage tit-for-tat tariffs have wrought.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.9 percent, while the tech-laden Nasdaq composite rose 1 percent.
White House and Chinese officials plan to meet Thursday and Friday to try to narrow their differences in the trade discussions. Although some investors hoped a breakthrough was within reach, there have been growing signs in recent days that relations between the two countries have worsened.
China this week lashed out at the National Basketball Association and Western businesses for what it viewed as improper support for the protests in Hong Kong. The Trump administration, meanwhile, blacklisted a range of Chinese firms amid allegations of human rights abuses, prompting an angry protest from the Chinese government.
Whether these escalating problems can be resolved during two days of talks is unclear, but the prolonged trade war has shown growing signs that it is causing problems for both countries' economies. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday released the minutes of its September meeting, and the word ""trade"" appeared in the discussion 28 times. It said, among other things, that ""trade policy concerns continued to weigh on firms' investment decisions,"" a sign that companies were cutting back while they await a resolution of the White House standoff with China.
On Wednesday, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the number of new job openings had fallen to its lowest level since March 2018. The labor market has cooled a bit this year, but it has remained relatively strong. Any sign of weakening heading into the 2020 election could create problems for the White House.
President Trump has insisted on nailing down a broad trade agreement that includes intellectual-property protections for American companies doing business in China, but he also has said he would consider a smaller-scale deal.
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is scheduled to meet this week with U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer and other officials in Washington. The two have been holding stop-and-go negotiations for nearly a year. To try to force Chinese officials to negotiate, Trump has slapped tariffs - or import penalties - on close to $300 billion in Chinese goods. Tariff rates are set to move higher on Oct. 15, and even more goods will face import penalties in December.
Trump contends that China must change its trade practices if it wants to make a deal. He has accused the Chinese government of stealing intellectual property from U.S. companies, unfairly subsidizing domestic firms and manipulating its currency to create a trading imbalance. He also has demanded that Beijing boost imports of U.S. agriculture products, such as soybeans and pork.
Trump has tried to tout the potential economic benefits of any deal to farmers, a key political constituent. He has already authorized close to $30 billion in payments to farmers as a way to relieve some of their financial losses, a controversial step that has little precedent.
One reason financial markets keep jolting up and down in anticipation of trade talks is because Trump keeps reversing his approach with little notice. He has repeatedly dialed up and then dialed back pressure on Chinese negotiators by announcing new tariffs and then delaying tariffs, sometimes without warning.
Chinese officials have expressed an openness to some changes in their trade relationship with the White House, but they have stopped well short of Trump's broader demands. There are growing signs that the prolonged standoff is damaging both nations, as economic growth in the United States and China has slowed markedly this year.
In recent weeks, Trump has acknowledged that U.S. manufacturing companies are cutting back on investment, but he has blamed that on the Federal Reserve, accusing the central bank of not moving quickly enough to lower interest rates.
Continual posturing by White House and Chinese officials has whipsawed the stock market since trade negotiations began in earnest late last year. Some indexes have spiked or plummeted based solely on rumors or partial developments, as traders or computer algorithms react to anything that might be perceived as news.
""The fact that markets are still trading on China trade talk innuendo is proof positive the algorithms are running the short-term show,"" said Nancy Tengler of Tengler Wealth Management.

All 11 stock market sectors were up in Wednesday's trading, with information technology and energy at the head of the pack.
""It's natural that technology is going to rally hard,"" said Kenny Polcari, senior market strategist at SlateStone Wealth. ""The tech stocks are the high fliers and get hit the hardest on the way down, and they are the ones that bounce the most on positive trade news.""
The Dow's biggest gainers in late-morning activity included Visa, American Express, Microsoft, Intel and Cisco.
Stocks fell sharply Tuesday - the Dow slid more than 300 points, or 1.19 percent - after Washington imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials and blacklisted several Chinese businesses on allegations that their work contributes to the repression of the nation's Muslim minority population. Since the beginning of October, Wall Street has bounced between pessimism over weakening U.S. manufacturing data and optimism over record low unemployment.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday that the number of job openings in August was flat month-over-month at 7.1 million.
""The peak was 7.626 million openings last November, so the labor market may have passed its peak for hiring demand in this business cycle,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank.
Rupkey said the data shows American companies ""still want you to come to work for them . . . despite the head winds of uncertainty and risks posed by the escalation of the trade war.""

HONG KONG - This city's subway system - spotless, efficient, cheap to ride - has been a source of civic pride since it began operating four decades ago, and it is often held up as a benchmark for public transportation everywhere.
When unrest began to grip Hong Kong early this summer, the Mass Transit Railway took on a different role. It carried protesters to demonstration venues, allowing them to leave the scene or shuttle between rallies in minutes. The spectacle of strangers clapping and cheering aboard trains and leading each other in chants replaced the usual sight of commuters hypnotized by their cellphones.
But as police crack down harder on dissent, station ticket halls and platforms are becoming battlegrounds, strewn with debris, tear-gas canisters and blood as officers clash violently with demonstrators.
Rail operator MTR Corp. also has become a protest target, stemming from a perception among demonstrators that it has conspired with authorities to stymie protest action. Stations have been vandalized so frequently in recent weeks that there is a shortage of parts needed for repairs, the rail union has said.
In a city where about 90 percent of journeys are via public transportation, the clashes have left some of Hong Kong's 7.5 million residents feeling they no longer have any safe spaces, susceptible to arrest or police scrutiny whenever they venture out. Some people are boycotting the MTR, while others suffer flashbacks when they ride the trains.""I am very afraid to take the MTR now, and bad thoughts always return to me when I pass by Prince Edward station,"" said David, a 20-year-old student who watched police rush into train cars on Aug. 31 and swing their batons indiscriminately at protesters and civilians, leaving several injured.
""So many things happened there, and I can't see this city as a safe place for me again,"" added David, who did not provide his full name out of fear of reprisal.
The fallout has exposed a trust gap between protesters and Hong Kong's government, which is not popularly elected and answers to Beijing.

Anyone ""with any public authority has completely lost all confidence of [the] Hong Kong people,"" Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker, said at a news conference Wednesday. ""It all stemmed from police brutality, which remains"" unpunished, she added.
The protests began over a now-withdrawn bill to allow extraditions to mainland China, but they have grown into a wider battle to achieve full democracy for Hong Kong and to defend the semiautonomous territory against further encroachment by Beijing.
MTR, a public company that also runs malls and other real estate, appeared to shift its stance toward the protests after Chinese state media last month accused the rail company of aiding protesters by allowing them to ride home after demonstrations.
""The MTR presented a smiling face to the radical protesters and gave a cold eye to the police. With its actions, it has added to Hong Kong's turmoil,"" said an editorial in the Global Times, a nationalist newspaper that often reflects the views of the ruling Communist Party.The language echoed a Chinese state media crusade against Cathay Pacific that eventually forced out the airline's senior management and several employees who had voiced support for protesters. MTR Corp. denied buckling to pressure but began shutting stations around protest zones as a ""prudent"" measure.
Then came the Aug. 31 flash point. A largely peaceful march marking a milestone for Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement ended with an elite police tactical unit entering subway cars at Prince Edward station, in the Kowloon district. Witnesses said officers used pepper spray and hit protesters with batons as they made arrests, requiring some to be taken away on stretchers.
""We appreciate that the MTR has had a great reputation, but everything has changed now,"" said a 21-year-old student who would be identified only by her family name, Chan.
Police said they pursued only ""radical"" protesters at the Prince Edward station, adding that some had changed out of their signature black clothing to blend in with commuters. The force has rejected rumors of deaths that night as malicious smears.
Yet for many in Hong Kong, that night was another step too far by the police, whom protesters accuse of using disproportionate force. Hong Kong's government has declined to meet a key demand from demonstrators to open an independent inquiry into the political crisis focusing on the police response.On Tuesday, U.S. lawmakers introduced a bipartisan bill that would ban the sale of riot-control equipment, including tear gas, to Hong Kong police, fearing that the American-made gear is being ""used to violently crack down on peaceful protesters.""
Since the August incident, protesters have targeted more MTR stations, smashing glass panels and spraying graffiti messages that accuse the corporation of colluding with the Chinese government.
At Po Lam, an outlying neighborhood, demonstrators confronted a station supervisor who later sought treatment in a hospital for minor injuries. On Sunday, protesters dumped trash cans and traffic cones down a stairwell at Central station and flooded the concourse with water. Some set an entrance ablaze.
The outpouring of anger has shocked MTR Corp., whose stock price has slumped 17 percent since mid-July.
In an open letter published Sunday, the rail operator's chairman, Rex Auyeung, and its chief executive, Jacob Kam, acknowledged the network is facing ""tremendous challenges.""
""At this crucial moment, we wish all sectors of the community could treasure and safeguard this railway network which has been carrying our collective memories over the past few decades,"" they wrote.
On Monday, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam toured Central station, inspecting graffiti on ticket machines and damage to turnstiles. Flanked by MTR executives, she wished injured staff a speedy recovery and thanked others for keeping the system operational.
At a news conference a day later, she focused her remarks on damage to the network and urged protesters to respect Hong Kong's infrastructure. ""I felt really upset after my inspection. No matter whether it is the Hong Kong International Airport or the MTR, they are both our lifelines,"" Lam said.Several protesters interviewed by The Washington Post said they believed that people had died in the Prince Edward melee, despite no conclusive evidence. Some residents have been leaving flowers at the station and performing Chinese burial rituals.
""We need the MTR Corporation to release all the CCTV videos and evidence related to August 31, but it still says no,"" said 23-year-old Kin, giving only his first name. ""I think among all the rubbish they've done, that's the worst thing.""
Protesters are planning more boycotts of the MTR, urging each other not to shop in malls connected to the subway stops. Some plan a ""sports day"" - a euphemism for jumping turnstiles - for the coming week. Students even set up makeshift barricades to practice their jumps.
A 25-year-old woman who was on the platform at Prince Edward, returning from a movie theater when police rushed in, said she has avoided the station since and taken extra precautions to check her surroundings whenever she rides the train.
""You need to be ready for war at any time,"" she said.

See how they run,"How many yogis does it take to fill a Democratic presidential primary?
On a single-night, triple-header CNN event this summer, two out of three candidates professed their love of the self-care arts. Almost up there with the number of dentists who recommend Crest.
""I love doing hot yoga!"" Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan said during one of the news network's many ""Presidential Town Halls"" while detailing the multiple seven-day silent meditation retreats he's gone on. Rep. Seth Moulton, who has since dropped out of the race, echoed Ryan's sentiments.
It's not enough for candidates to feel America's pain right now; they apparently have to prove that they can feel their own pain first. We're in the Kale Smoothie Era of Democratic politics.
They seem to be responding to the sizable wellness-oriented portion of the American electorate that's now a Twilight Zone away from a few election cycles ago when politicians were scrambling to be the one you'd most want to knock back a beer with.
If the #selfcare movement has an avatar in this 2020 campaign, it is, of course, Marianne Williamson: spiritual adviser to Oprah, author of 13 self-help books (four of them No. 1 New York Times bestsellers, including 1992's ""A Return to Love""), and the only person in the world powerful enough to help Aerosmith's Steven Tyler break his drug and alcohol habits. Williamson may be Goop personified, but she's hardly alone in a field of vegetable-munching, weightlifting, mantra-chanting Democratic hopefuls out to show not tell that they can be America's healthy alternative to a technically obese president who tweet rants at 4 a.m.
And because this is an age when follower count presumably leads to votes, these private, individualistic rituals have taken on the cast of 24-hour Instagram theater:
Sen. Cory Booker, a vegan who meditates daily (""I find it centers me,"" he said), had to restrict himself to fried PB&J sandwiches on a stick, instead of the standard pork chop on a stick, at the Iowa State Fair.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a vegetarian, has done an interview in the ocean while surfing and is the only female ""grunting gym rat"" to take part in a hardcore circuit training workout for select members of the House.
Sen. Kamala Harris is a professed lover of SoulCycle, that spin-class-slash-lifestyle-choice where you shout out affirmations and strive for both your personal best and euphoria all in 45 sweaty minutes. (She's said she won't join boycotts of the brand because its owner threw a fundraiser for President Trump.)
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand does bench presses with 25-pound weights both for the benefits of reporters and impressive, if tonally deaf Twitter videos.

Montana Gov. Steve Bullock announced he was running via a Twitter video of him literally running in a charity race.
Former congressman John Delaney, easily the most jacked of all the candidates, regularly posts Twitter videos of his workouts doing dead lifts (""Got to be strong to beat Trump"") or doing 10 pullups (""Easy!"").
Then there's Beto O'Rourke, who, as he contemplated running for president, took his own journey of self-discovery that took him all the way to the Santuario de Chimayo, a chapel built atop an ancient holy site in northern New Mexico and home to what is believed to be magical dirt with healing properties.
""I went in,"" O'Rourke said. ""And ate some dirt."" (This isn't exactly encouraged.)
As a candidate, O'Rourke is so wellness-oriented that he's held an eight-mile bicycling town hall, and inspired a recurring Jimmy Fallon Web sketch called ""Beto Breaks the Internet"" in which Fallon impersonates O'Rourke doing, say, an Instagram story of his ""12th workout of the day.""
In it, Fallon-as-O'Rourke declares, ""Doctors say the chemical makeup of my sweat is closer to Gatorade than water, so I just leave it on the machine just in case anyone needs a little boost."" 
""Wellness is not an idea that is exclusively left, but definitely the 2016 election was when you really saw the term explode on the left with the idea that the world was just too traumatic and too difficult and you have to take care of yourself,"" says Amy Larocca, a New York Magazine writer who's working on a book on the wellness movement for Knopf. ""If you look at Instagram mentions of self-care, they increase exponentially after the election of Trump."" 
The search term, according to Google Trends, hit a five-year high in the week after the election, and peaked in September 2018 during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. More than 6 in 10 Americans report the current political climate to be a stressor, according to a 2018 report from the American Psychological Association. 
""Mental wellness is by far the biggest trend in the U.S. wellness market - whether it's the big spike in meditation, the explosion in cannabis and CBD, or the new obsession with sleep,"" says Beth McGroarty of the Global Wellness Institute, a nonprofit that researches the $4.2 trillion global wellness economy. ""We seem to desire more than anything to be unconscious, the only time we're not in front of screens, social media, and divisive, insane news cycles.""
McGroarty says there's also been an increase in interest in what might be considered ""woo-woo spiritual wellness"" like astrology, crystals and tarot reading since Trump's election. That's self-care in 2019.
A 1988 quote from African American lesbian poet Audre Lorde can be found paraphrased and misappropriated all over Instagram: ""Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare."" She was referring to her life of marginalization because of her identity. This moment probably wasn't what she hoped to inspire. 


Soon after the end of the first night of debates in Detroit, Williamson's followers gathered in a half-moon in a nearby concert hall, singing ""Amazing Grace"" and waiting for their long-shot candidate to bless them with her presence. 
She greeted them with an impromptu speech about angels, demons, love, hate and, somehow, Abraham Lincoln. Then a voice rang out from the crowd: ""We need to make an offering!"" Spiritual? Religious? Pagan sacrifice? 
Whatever the person meant, Williamson understood. ""Tonight I don't do that,"" she said, but she did encourage them to show her their love in the form of enough $1 donations to meet qualifications for getting onto the next debate stage. (So far Williamson has passed the donor threshold, but she looks unlikely to meet a polling requirement by Wednesday's deadline.)
By partaking in wellness culture, Democrats are in many ways speaking to their base, which is not the same base that delighted in Bill Clinton leisurely jogging to McDonald's. 
And they're speaking to a mainstream culture in which the language has been Oprah-fied and Michelle Obama-fied. People talk about therapy and holistic betterment or the HeadSpace app in everyday conversation. (Hey, even Clinton is now mostly vegan.)
""The Democratic Party this time around is not trying very hard so far to appeal to working-class voters because in Democratic primaries there aren't as many as there used to be,"" says William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who's worked on six presidential campaigns, including Clinton's. ""What you see in the concentration of yoga, meditation, and working out is classic tropes and habits of the urban upper middle class.""

"To mark anniversary, Hong Kong protesters defy ban","Clashes escalate as police intensify crackdown on pro-democracy activists 
HONG KONG - Protesters hurled firebombs and set blazes Saturday across Hong Kong as they defied warnings to stay off the streets on a key pro-democracy anniversary - touching off some of the most dramatic clashes during 13 weeks of unrest over Beijing's influence on the territory.
Demonstrators were pursued through the city, chased by riot police using the full arsenal of their tools: volleys of tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets and huge numbers of officers wielding batons. Water cannons sprayed streams tinted with blue dye in an apparent effort to mark protesters.
Protesters in turn set piles of rubbish and debris on fire, hoping to block advancing police. Some protesters were armed with metal poles and hammers and carried makeshift shields for protection. 
At night, clashes moved from central Hong Kong to Kowloon, prompting the closure of five of the main subway lines. Videos shared on social media and messaging apps showed commuters crying and hugging each other, as pools of blood and debris littered the ground after an operation by riot police.

The protesters were marking an especially significant day in Hong Kong's political history: Five years ago, Beijing announced a plan for limited democracy in the semiautonomous territory, kicking off a 79-day occupation of city streets that invigorated a new generation of Hong Kong activists. 
The intensity of Saturday's scenes underscored how neither protesters nor Hong Kong authorities are holding back - pushing the city even further from a resolution to the months-long crisis. Police said they arrested at least 40 people Saturday night.
A Hong Kong government statement on Saturday appeared to quash among the most fundamental of protester demands: that of direct elections for Hong Kong's leader and lawmakers. 
A government spokesperson said while universal suffrage is an ""ultimate aim … rashly embarking on political reform again will further polarize society, which is an irresponsible act."" 
Authorities had banned a march, organized by a group known for its ability to pull off large and nonviolent assemblies, but tens of thousands showed up anyway.
""Of course, I am not afraid of [the government],"" said Eddie Wong, a 62-year-old protester wearing a black face mask. ""They want us to feel fear, but they are totally wrong about who were are."" 
A procession earlier in the day turned violent after several hours when police shot off tear gas to clear the crowd. The main focal point early in the day was the area outside the legislative complex that protesters 
briefly occupied in July. 
Protesters responded with bricks, homemade gasoline bombs and flashed lasers at officers shooting at them. A forceful police advance sent them into the Wan Chai and Causeway Bay neighborhoods - known for their neon-lit bars and glitzy shopping malls. 
A group gathered for a short time in the Tsim Sha Tsui area, dotted with luxury hotels, before police launched a clearance there, too. 
Protesters retreated deeper into Kowloon, and riot police then stormed multiple subway stations, swinging their batons. Residents and commuters continued to be in the stations at the time, and some ran off screaming in fear. Hong Kong's hospital authority said seven people sought treatment for protest-related problems but did not specify the type of injuries.
The clashes turned the city's heart into a dizzying mix of flames, tear gas and shouts from protesters and police alike. Two government helicopters hovered over the scene for hours. 
The protesters had gathered after police arrested almost a dozen prominent activists and pro-democracy lawmakers the day before - widely perceived as a deliberately timed deterrent against further demonstrations. A now-suspended plan to allow extraditions to mainland China floated earlier this year has again reawakened the sense that Hong Kong does not control its future, and millions have taken to the streets over the past months to protest Beijing's creeping influence. 
China has responded with hardening rhetoric, branding the protesters as rioters and even terrorists, while police have arrested more than 800. 
On Saturday, China's state broadcaster released a video of paramilitary police conducting armed drills in Shenzhen, a city that borders Hong Kong, with the caption: ""Able to attack at any time!""
Hong Kong's government has so far refused to give in to any of the protesters' demands, including a full withdrawal of the extradition bill and an independent inquiry into the crisis and police use of force, despite widespread support for the two concessions. 
""Five years ago today marked the end of a constructive dialogue with the Chinese government,"" said Johnson Yeung, a veteran activist who took part in Saturday's march and was arrested at an earlier demonstration. ""They took true control of the executive branch of Hong Kong's government.""
He added, ""It really raised the bar for people and it laid the foundation of the civil resistance movement that is happening now.""The Civil Human Rights Front, the group behind the huge, nonviolent demonstrations over recent months, had initially planned a rally through central Hong Kong to mark the anniversary. Police, however, declined to authorize the march, even after an appeal.

Some participants couched their procession in religious songs and paraphernalia, hoping that a religious gathering was a way to get around the police ban. Some carried bibles, posters of Jesus and Moses and repeatedly sang ""Sing Hallelujah to the Lord,"" a song that is among the unofficial protest anthems. 
Another group gathered in Causeway Bay, one of the main shopping districts in Hong Kong. It found creative ways of advertising its gathering - a day of mass shopping, a day of ""viewing flowers"" in neighboring parks - to get around the police ban. Among the marchers in Causeway Bay was Joshua Wong, a prominent activist and the face of the 2014 protests who had been arrested and released on bail Friday. 
In a statement early Sunday, police confirmed that two police officers fired live rounds, which they characterized as ""warning shots,"" into the air.

Stocks sink amid U.S.-China tension,"Stocks continued their August swoon Monday on fears that Hong Kong protests, falling worldwide bond yields and the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute could lead to a global recession.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 462 points before the blue chips clawed some of that back to finish down about 390 points at 25,898, about a 1.5 percent drop. Financial services was among the hardest-hit Dow sectors, with Goldman Sachs Group off 2.6 percent. Pfizer, United Technologies and Caterpillar were also big drags. Only drug giant Merck stayed slightly above water.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished down 36 points at 2,882, a 1.2 percent drop. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index fell about 95 points on the day to close at 7,863, or 1.2 percent down.
All 11 S&P stock sectors closed lower, led down by banks, consumer staples, materials and technologies. Banks are among the most vulnerable when bond yields drop, because it is more difficult to make money on loans.
""The escalating trade tensions, combined with low volume and traditionally weaker-than-average price returns in August and September, are contributing to a retest of last week's low for the S&P 500,"" said Sam Stovall of CFRA Research.
European markets closed down across the board. Asian markets were mixed, with the Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropping 0.44 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 and the Shanghai Composite closed in positive territory.
Several factors have contributed to the market turbulence in recent sessions, including China's threat to devalue its currency, massive protests in Hong Kong that could prompt a response from the Chinese government, an escalation of the U.S.-China trade war and a flight to bonds.
Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius said in a note he released over the weekend that he does not expect a U.S.-China trade deal before the 2020 election.
Hatzius now sees fourth-quarter U.S. growth at 1.8 percent, lower than many forecasts.
President Trump has hardened his position on China trade in the past two weeks, threatening to increase tariffs from the current 10 percent to 25 percent next month if the Chinese do not make concessions to the United States.
The trade back-and-forth has fostered a feeling of uncertainty among American businesses, making it more difficult for companies to make long-term plans. The uncertainty has been felt in stock prices. The Dow is about 5 percent off its all-time high of one month ago.
Monday's decline follows a turbulent start to August, which is historically one of the worst months of the year for stocks. But the trade war with China is casting a pall over the global economy, threatening a decade-long U.S. boom that had pushed stocks to all-time highs.
""At this point it is up to the president,"" Nancy Tengler of Tengler Wealth Management wrote in a note Monday. ""Cut a trade deal with China, and we can avoid recession. Stocks will like that a good deal, too.""
The closely watched 10-year U.S. Treasury bond was down to 1.633 percent, a sign that investors may be heading away from risk and toward the safety of long-term bonds. Yields drop when bond prices rise. Some European countries have negative bond yields. That means people are paying governments to hold their money for them. Historically people buy government bonds and expect interest payments on those bonds as a reward for lending the government money.
Stocks are coming off their worst day of the year last Monday and finished five turbulent sessions on Friday only slightly negative for the week.

The consequences of Hong Kong's heroic dissent,"HONG KONG

The masked men who recently tossed firebombs at Jimmy Lai's home targeted one of this city's foremost democracy advocates. Lai, a 71-year-old media billionaire
, calls this summer's ongoing protest ""a martyrdom movement"" and ""a last-straw movement."" It has an intensity and dynamic that bewilders the protesters' opponents in Beijing and in Hong Kong's Beijing-obedient city administration.
Today's mostly young protesters will be middle-aged in 2047, at the expiration of the 50-year agreement
that ostensibly accords Hong Kong protected status as an island of freedom. Beijing attempted to whittle away that status with a proposed 2003 law against ""subversion."" And by devaluing suffrage via the 2014 requirement that candidates for the chief executive receive approval from a Beijing-loyal committee. And by this year's extradition bill that would have facilitated sweeping Hong Kongers into the maw of China's opaque criminal-justice system. 
Monday's New York Times carried a full-page ad paid for by ""the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China."" Which means, effectively, by the Chinese Communist Party. The ad said: ""We are resolutely committed to 'One Country, Two Systems' which provides the constitutional guarantee for Hong Kong's continued development and success as a free and open society."" The ad pledged ""dialogue to talk through differences and look for common ground with no preconditions."" 
But the ""one county, two systems"" formulation - agreed to in 1997
, when British authority ended - as a 50-year framework for Hong Kong's relations with the PRC is an inherently menacing precondition. And Beijing's consistently sinister behavior reveals a determination, as implacable as it is predictable, to incrementally nullify ""one nation, two systems"" by reducing Hong Kong to just another jurisdiction wholly subservient to China's deepening tyranny. 
For Leninists such as Xi Jinping wielding a party-state,
nothing
is more important than the party's unchallenged primacy. Another ""Tiananmen Square"" - a Hong Kong massacre - would be calamitous for China's Leninists, but less so than weakening the Communist Party's primacy. The party is, Lai says, ""detached from reality"" and ""will always make the wrong decision"" as it tries to become ""the most absolute dictatorship in human history.""

In 1940, Winston Churchill warned against ""a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science."" That is China's aspiration with ""digital Leninism,"" an application of science through manipulative technologies that neither Churchill nor his contemporary, George Orwell, anticipated. With a steadily refined repression apparatus, aptly called ""cyber-totalitarianism
,"" China's surveillance state is enmeshing everyone in a ""social credit"" system. Individuals' cumulative commercial and social media transactions give them a score that determines their access to education, housing, clinics, travel and more - even pet ownership. Although China's published statistics are as untrustworthy as the regime itself, there are reasons to believe that in this decade China has spent more on ""stability maintenance
"" than on its military. Hong Kong is watching this. 
And Hong Kong is reading Ma Jian's dystopian novel ""China Dream,"" which is banned in mainland China but not here. The protagonist is Ma Daode, director of the fictional (so far) China Dream Bureau
, which aspires to ""replace all private dreams
"" with one communal dream. Ma Daode hopes to develop ""a neural implant,"" a device whereby ""just one click of a button
and government directives will be transferred wirelessly into the brains
"" of the governed. This is not much more Orwellian than China's evolving reality. 
In her 1951 ""The Origins of Totalitarianism,"" Hannah Arendt argued that a tyrannical regime, wielding bureaucracy and mass media, could achieve permanence by conscripting the citizenry's consciousness. This echoed Orwell's foreboding: ""Imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever."" In 1956, Arendt thought her theory had been refuted by a fact - the Hungarian Revolution, which demonstrated that no state can interrupt ""all channels of communication
."" Hong Kong sees Beijing using new technologies in the service of an evil permanence. 
""To see what is in front of one's nose,"" wrote Orwell, ""needs a constant struggle."" Belatedly, the world is seeing. The Economist recently editorialized: ""The West's 25-year bet on China has failed."" The wager was that ""market totalitarianism"" is an oxymoron. Embedding China in the global economy supposedly would open it to the softening effects of commerce, which would be solvents of authoritarianism. The West's tardy but welcome disenchantment is, as the Economist says, ""the starkest reversal in modern geopolitics."" If Hong Kong's heroic refusal to go gentle into Beijing's dark night is accelerating this disenchantment, the summer of dissent has been this decade's grandest and most important development.

China won't die laughing. Just ask 'South Park.',"Dictators. Always so humorous.
Take China's communist officialdom. You've probably heard about the ""South Park"" episode last week that the Chinese government didn't find amusing. And the fake apology from the comedy show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone.
No? Well, then, you must live in China, where free speech isn't actually allowed, and where the episode in question - ""Band in China"" - has been expunged from the cyber airwaves. The plot of the show is, as usual, silly with a sting (and too complicated to summarize in this limited space).
Basically, characters familiar to ""South Park"" fans make fun of China's policy of censorship - well, whaddya know - and Hollywood's kowtowing to China by tweaking films to suit Communist Party sensibilities. 
As if on cue, Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey drew backlash from several Chinese entities for a tweet last Friday expressing sympathy for the protesters in Hong Kong. ""Fight for freedom,"" Morey wrote, as any red-blooded American might. ""Stand with Hong Kong."" 
You'd have thought he had said Chinese basketball players can't jump. Jeez. 
But, of
course, Americans support pro-democracy freedom fighters everywhere. China exports consumer goods. America exports freedom - in speech, in religion and in military support. Except when she doesn't, as when President Trump reportedly told Chinese President-for-Life Xi Jinping that he'd remain silent on the Hong Kong protests as long as trade talks were ongoing.
This was in June, long before Trump also suggested that China investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Funny how authoritarians seem drawn to one another. Rather than discuss the spark that ignited the protests - a proposal to extradite criminal suspects from Hong Kong to China - the president of the United States essentially said ""no"" to free speech and ""yes"" to censorship. 
In other words, last week's ""South Park"" episode hit all the right notes for freedom and democracy and all the wrong ones for China, which, apparently, has no sense of humor, especially regarding itself. Any criticism deemed anti-government spells doom to the truth-sayer, an operating principle that applies as well to businesses and corporations conducting business with China.
One would think that such a large, prosperous nation could withstand a tweet of no real consequence. But a dictatorship can't countenance the slightest dissent, lest chaos - the wolf that sniffs at the doors of the self- anointed - sense a hint of weakness or fear on the other side. As the Hong Kong protests have escalated to violence and vandalism, the wolf's tail is surely wagging, while Beijing's patience is tested. 
Meanwhile, scheduled broadcasts of the NBA's preseason games in China have been scrapped by the state-run media, despite apologies, mea culpas and tender entreaties from various basketball officials, owners and, of course, poor Morey, who deleted his tweet. Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta (a name that cannot be improved upon) tweeted that Morey ""does NOT speak for"" the team. The NBA called Morey's comments ""regrettable."" 
And NBA Commissioner Adam Silver cut to the chase while speaking to Japan's Kyodo News on Monday, saying: ""There is no doubt, the economic impact is already clear."" What happened to the guy who moved the All-Star Game out of North Carolina in response to that state's law restricting public bathroom use by transgender people? And who said, ""In this day and age, you really do have to stand for something""?
Whatever that ""something"" used to be, today it is money over principle, censorship over free speech, and submission over character. Silver clarified his thoughts Tuesday, saying that the NBA supports players' and executives' rights to express themselves freely. 
But ""South Park,"" the adolescent, profane, goofball cartoon show, got it right from the start. In their mock apology, Parker and Stone wrote: ""Like the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. We too love money more than freedom and democracy.""
In a normal world, all of this would have been a joke. Instead, we're reminded of the fragility of freedom. Dissenting from authority is in our DNA, and standing with others similarly inclined is paying forward the debt we owe those who paved our way. But our very best thing is our sense of humor, companion to which is an essential tolerance for irreverence. It is the rigidly reverent, whether ideological or religious, who must mind everyone's business and quash the dissenters.
We should remember this always as we pick our friends and enemies. If they can't handle a cheer for freedom - or take a joke - pick up your ball and go play somewhere else. And don't let them watch.

"In operas, playing the Trump card","Art, it's said, holds a mirror up to society - particularly on the stage. In Europe, especially, even traditional operas are frequently updated or reinterpreted with contemporary social commentary. Thirty years ago, Nazi uniforms were a veritable cliche in works by Verdi and Wagner. These days, the figure who's appearing more and more as a symbol of power and its abuses - and clad in an iconic bouffant wig and overlong red tie - is Donald Trump.

Trump has been featured as the Duke of Mantua in Verdi's ""Rigoletto"" in Linz, Austria, singing one of opera's most famous arias, ""La donna e mobile"" (""Woman is fickle""), to excuse his philandering ways. (The Seattle Opera will offer its own Trump-like take on this piece in August.) He has appeared as Baron Ochs, the wealthy bumpkin eager to marry a beautiful young girl, in Strauss's ""Der Rosenkavalier,"" in Melbourne, Australia. And in some cases - such as Anthony Davis's ""The Central Park Five,"" which opened at the Long Beach Opera in June, or the Cantonese opera ""Trump on Show"" this spring in Hong Kong - Trump has even appeared as himself. 
These appearances may seem like acts of protest or provocation, signaling a viewpoint that opera audiences abroad are likely to share, tapping into an easy laugh along the lines of ""Saturday Night Live,"" which has helped to propagate many features of the Trump iconography. But they also downplay the actual political issues: A singing Trump is a comic Trump and not a very serious Trump. 
""I think I got about equal boos and laughs,"" says Thomas Segen, a tenor who sang the role of Trump in ""The Central Park Five."" ""It was sort of a moment for people to let loose a little bit.""
For the soprano Sara Hershkowitz, Trump has become something of a breakout role. Every year, the Lowlands music festival in the Netherlands, a large, open-air festival akin to Chicago's Lollapalooza, includes a single classical act on its program. In 2017, it was the North Netherlands Symphony Orchestra, which hired Hershkowitz to perform the eight-minute work ""Mysteries of the Macabre,"" a high-wire avant-garde piece for coloratura soprano that the 20th-century Hungarian composer Gyorgy Ligeti excerpted from his opera ""Le Grand Macabre."" But performing a piece for an audience of 15,000 at a pop-music festival is quite different than doing it in a concert hall. The orchestra told Hershkowitz that rather than just coming out in an evening dress, they wanted her to create a concept and a staging and that they'd like something provocative. 
""I knew they meant a bikini,"" Hershkowitz said last week by phone from Los Angeles. ""I thought, 'I should do it in a burqa.' That would be provocative. But I don't want to be perceived as mocking Islam, particularly as an American Jewish artist. I thought, 'What is provocative in 2016?' We hadn't had the election yet. Everybody thought Hillary was going to win.""
In the opera, the character singing the excerpts is Gepopo, the head of espionage for the fictive Prince Go-Go. ""He goes in preaching fear and hysteria to this little town about the end of the world,"" Hershkowitz says. ""It's in nonsense language; it makes no sense at all. It's mumbo-jumbo. But it's mumbo-jumbo that hypnotizes people. It dazzles and entertains, even though she is saying nothing."" So Hershkowitz decided it would be fitting to dress up as Donald Trump - in three incarnations: in a suit and red tie, as a tantrumming baby and in a Miss America pageant swimsuit. ""It wasn't a stretch at all,"" she says.
But after Trump won the election, and before the festival, Hershkowitz was convinced that the orchestra wouldn't let her continue with her idea. However, the orchestra supported it enthusiastically. So did the crowd. ""They went absolutely bananas,"" she says. 
Now, ""Mysteries of the Macabre"" has become something of a calling card. In June, Hershkowitz performed it with the Bergen Symphony. She has three more iterations coming up, including her debut with the BBC Scottish Symphony in Glasgow in November. 
What does it mean to play Trump in 2019? 
""It's almost like playing a mythological figure or a saint or something,"" says Segen, the tenor. To prepare for the role in ""The Central Park Five,"" he watched old footage of Trump, who in the piece is supposed to appear in his pre-presidential incarnation. The events of the opera, about the incarceration of five young men for a crime they didn't commit, take place in 1989, when the real Trump took out full-page newspaper ads calling for the death penalty to be reinstated.
In creating the opera, however, Segen and the director opted to incorporate some of the more familiar, and more recent, Trump shtick.
""There's sort of an iconography of Trump,"" Segen says. ""It's more what people are looking for, rather than the actual nuances of character. That simian kind of smirk he has. The long tie."" 
The production even included a scene in which the character sits on a golden toilet - and makes a phone call. (Twitter had not been invented in 1989.) 
Having Trump evoked in opera isn't new - not since Peter Sellars set his provocative 1988 staging of Mozart's ""The Marriage of Figaro"" on the 52nd floor of Trump Tower. (The opera centers on a wealthy aristocrat who has decided to abandon the ""droit du seigneur,"" his right to sleep with every woman on her wedding night before her husband does.) And obviously, the phenomenon is far from exclusive to opera: The spoken theater has already seen everything from Trump stagings (the Public Theater in New York staged Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar"" to evoke Trump in 2017) to Trump plays. 
But Trump, as president, certainly lends himself well to opera: Whatever you think of him, he's a larger-than-life figure who evokes large-scale reactions and is prone to easy-to-imitate gestures. Therefore, he slips easily into comic opera, in particular - such as a ""Mikado"" in the Swiss town of St. Gallen that had the Japanese aristocrats use what one reviewer called ""typical Donald Trump gestures"" of the hands. (W.S. Gilbert, ""Mikado's"" librettist, conceived of the work as a sendup of British mores in any case, and it's traditional to insert contemporary references.)
Admittedly, Trump isn't the only world leader to get this kind of operatic recognition. He's often paired with other equally recognizable, not to say infamous, figures - such as Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who was a character in the Cantonese opera about Trump, based on the premise that Trump had a long-lost Chinese twin brother. Similarly, the Hamburg State Opera's production of Verdi's ""Nabucco"" in March cast the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar as a cross between the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, Vladimir Putin and Trump (with the slogan ""Assyria first!""). (The show's director, Kirill Serebrennikov, was under house arrest in Russia for two years at the time he was directing it and had to do all his work by means of images and messages exchanged on computer USB sticks.)
Putting political figures onstage in veiled or allegorical form is a trope as old as opera. But a watershed event in the depiction of actual politicians came with ""Nixon in China,"" the 1987 opera by John Adams and Peter Sellars, about President Richard Nixon's historic visit to China in 1972. There followed a whole wave of docu-operas, including some roles for presidents - a notable recent example being Philip Glass's revision of ""Appomattox"" at the Washington National Opera, which included a part for Lyndon Johnson, in one scene sitting on a toilet. 
A concern, though, is that the feel-good amusement generated by the snickers is a way to conceal the actual political threat - just as the Nixon figure in Adams's opera, and Alice Goodman's libretto, became a kind of simple American guy out of his depth, rather than the far more malign figure he actually was. Does it contribute to Offenbach's opera ""The Tales of Hoffmann"" to have the creator of the mechanical doll, Olympia, appear as a Trump look-alike, as he did in Meiningen, Germany, in 2017? Or does it safely defuse Trump to have him appear onstage, over and over, as a buffoon? 
Even when the intent is to skewer Trump and his policies, it may not always come across. The music/theater piece ""Kein Licht"" by the French composer Philippe Manoury got great attention before its 2017 premiere, since Elfriede Jelinek, the Austrian Nobel Prize-winning author, wrote a Trump role into the piece. But for some critics, in practice, the result didn't actually amount to a strong attack. 
And not every observer agrees that Trump onstage is a trend in opera.
Citing three productions, including the Serebrennikov ""Nabucco,"" Manuel Brug, the critic of the German paper Die Welt, said, ""There are probably a few more, but [Trump] hasn't really become a permanent guest on German stages.""
But for Hershkowitz, it has been eye-opening.
 ""Singing Ligeti to millennials at a rock-concert setting was a huge eureka moment for me, about how if we got more creative about presenting classical music,"" she said. 
""We talk about, 'How do we make classical music cool, bring in the young people?' "" she said. ""You don't. Classical music is not cool. It's thrilling, visceral, raw and sexy but not cool. But if you simply present all the juiciness that's already there, just go to where people are camping at a rock festival - they got it. This is avant-garde."" 
Hershkowitz is even in discussions about bringing her interpretation of the piece to the United States. At the same time, she doesn't want this particular moment to last forever. 
""As much fun as I'm having,"" she says, ""I hope I get to create a different version in 2020.""

The lunatic raves. We shrug.,"Uh-oh. President Trump is in such a state of panic about his dimming reelection prospects that he's getting his lies mixed up and occasionally blurting out the truth.
""It's tough for Apple to pay tariffs if it's competing with a very good company [Samsung] that's not,"" the president told reporters Sunday - flatly contradicting the ridiculous and utterly false narrative that he has spent months trying to sell. Trump apparently forgot his standard lie that China is somehow paying ""billions of dollars"" in tariffs, acknowledging instead that they are taxes paid by U.S. companies and, ultimately, the American consumer.
This reflects more than just the difficulty of juggling multiple lies. Evidence suggests that Trump is melting down. Again.
And for good reason.
Fears of a global recession, greatly exacerbated by Trump's erratic and self-destructive trade policies, have sent financial markets tumbling. A sharp downturn would close off one of the principal lines of attack the president was hoping to use against his Democratic opponent. He tried it out at a rally in New Hampshire last week: ""You have no choice but to vote for me,"" he told the crowd, ""because your 401(k)'s down the tubes, everything's gonna be down the tubes"" if he loses. ""So whether you love me or hate me, you gotta vote for me.""
Fact check: No.
Trump is flailing. He berates his handpicked chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, for not cutting interest rates fast enough to goose the economy. He practically begs Chinese President Xi Jinping for a meeting to work out a trade deal - any trade deal, apparently - and is met with silence. He threatens more tariffs but then backs down, at least for now. According to published reports, he sees himself as the victim of a conspiracy to exaggerate the growing economic anxiety in order to hurt his chances of winning a second term.
He entertains grandiose, almost Napoleonic fantasies - purchasing Greenland from Denmark in what he calls ""a large real estate deal,"" perhaps, or imposing a naval blockade to force regime change in Venezuela. He apparently spent much of this past weekend fuming about not getting credit for how his New Hampshire rally broke an attendance record for the arena that had been set by Elton John.

And Trump can't seem to stop railing against a recent Fox News poll that showed him losing to four of the leading Democratic contenders. The president seems to consider Fox News his administration's Ministry of Propaganda - indeed, that is the role the network's morning-show hosts and prime-time anchors loyally play - but the polling unit is a professional operation. ""There's something going on at Fox, I'll tell you right now. And I'm not happy with it,"" Trump told reporters Sunday
. He added a threat, saying that Fox ""is making a big mistake"" because he is ""the one that calls the shots"" on next year's general election debates - the implication being that Fox News might not get to broadcast one of them if it doesn't toe the party line.
For the record, Trump's claim about his political standing is that it couldn't be better - but could be better.

""Great cohesion inside the Republican Party, the best I have ever seen,"" he tweeted Monday. ""Despite all of the Fake News, my Poll Numbers are great. New internal polls show them to be the strongest we've had so far! Think what they'd be if I got fair media coverage!""
An hour later, he was back on Twitter to attack Anthony Scaramucci, who famously spent 11 days as White House communications director and recently became the latest Trump supporter to hit the ""eject"" button. Predictably, Trump called him a ""nut job,"" claimed to barely know him and dusted off the ultimate insult, calling him ""bad on TV.""

The astonishing thing is that the president of the United States is, let's face it, raving like a lunatic - and everyone just shrugs.
The nation is still reeling from two mass shootings. The financial markets are yo-yoing by hundreds of points. A bomb in Afghanistan, where we're still at war, killed 63 revelers at a wedding. Tension between the United States and Iran continues to mount. North Korea keeps testing new missiles. India is playing with fire in Kashmir. Hong Kong has been convulsed for months by massive protests seeking to guarantee basic freedoms.
And Trump obsesses about buying Greenland.
The truth is that we don't have an actual presidency right now. We have a tiresome reality show whose ratings have begun to slide - and whose fading star sees cancellation on the way.

"Nobody expects politics on the Disney Channel, so why from Le Batard on ESPN?","Okay, let's take an unconventional, unvarnished look at this Dan Le Batard-ESPN diplomatic divide that popped out of the Bristol jack-in-the-box bin when I was on vacation.*
*By the way, it is wholly possible that my next column hiatus will be forever; I can't take it anymore. Sports Nation is perpetually on the edge of a cliff, and America is on tilt. So, frankly, I'm thinking about a one-way ticket to paradise in 2020. I'm not sure where paradise is, but I'm hoping Amtrak can get me there because I may not get into a car or a plane for the rest of my natural life.
But I digress.
So Le Batard is unhappy that ESPN's no-politics policy prohibits its on-air chatterboxes from delving into real issues beyond sports.
In response to the ""Send her back!"" chants directed at Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) at a President Trump rally in North Carolina, Le Batard - on his ESPN Radio show - said, ""There's a racial division in this country that's being instigated by the president, and we here at ESPN haven't had the stomach for that fight.""
For argument's sake, let me play devil's advocate - the devil, of course, being ESPN - on this one.
We'll start by giving you a hypothetical example focusing on one of ESPN's Disney relations, the Disney Channel.
Imagine the Disney Channel decided that, between daily episodes of ""Raven's Home"" and ""Andi Mack,"" it wanted some telegenic host to talk amiably about the Disney schedule. But let's say that person decided to go off-script, and every once in a while, rather than discussing Mickey Mouse and Snow White, weighed in on Brexit, boxing and the border wall.
Something tells me this individual would no longer have a parking spot anywhere near the happiest place on Earth.
The Disney brand is all about magical kingdoms, fairy-tale stories and a fantasy world of delight. Its powers that be don't want a reality check on, say, economic woes, and Disney-bound viewers are not looking for updates on protests in Hong Kong.
Disney, understandably, would have no interest in one of its spokesmen exercising freedom of speech in any way that interrupts the flow of business.
Which brings us to ESPN.
Like Le Batard, I am also an ESPN talker of sorts. I might not like the company's head-in-the-turf stance on the crashing planetary disorder around us, but in the cable network's attempt to maximize profits - a centuries-old American tradition - it has decided to build a sports video palace in which most of the real world does not penetrate.
Thus, I am aware that, between the turn and river cards at the World Series of Poker main event, the suits don't want me pontificating on our unrelenting history of racial injustice or the lack of clean drinking water in Flint, Mich., or the fact that the production trailer I'm sitting in is unconscionably hot because of climate change.
Would I like ESPN to sometimes embrace the world beyond stadiums and arenas? Yes. But I haven't even met new ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro to tell him this, partly because I fear he would fire me upon first sight.
Besides, if ESPN opened that door, when would it ever close? If Le Batard's shorts are all bunched up about fracking, maybe Bomani Jones will disagree on ""High Noon,"" then Woody Paige chimes in on ""Around the Horn"" before, God forbid, Stephen A. Smith blows a gasket about the entire natural gas industry on ""First Take.""
And suddenly ESPN is Fox News or MSNBC, and there won't be any time for Adam Schefter to report that the Jacksonville Jaguars' provisional fifth-round pick in 2024 might be traded to the Los Angeles Rams for a case of iPad chargers.
So my advice to Le Batard is: If you must, join Victor Laszlo for late-night resistance meetings, but in general, you have to zip it on-air when it comes to immigration reform.
P.S. For what it's worth, I might have voted for Eugene V. Debs in 1908.

China rolls out new weapons to mark 70th anniversary,"Gala celebrations include emphasis on extensive nuclear arsenal
BEIJING - The Chinese Communist Party flaunted an astonishing array of new weapons systems, many of them nuclear, in a highly choreographed military parade Tuesday in front of thousands of carefully selected citizens.
But the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China was overshadowed by a different gathering: clashes and rallies on the streets of Hong Kong, where demonstrators took to the streets in a display of raw people power.
The divergence in political ideologies could hardly have been laid out more starkly.
In Beijing, the increasingly authoritarian Xi Jinping stood in the very spot overlooking Tiananmen Square where Mao Zedong had declared the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, following in the footsteps of the Soviet Union.
With goose-stepping soldiers, a convoy of missiles and portraits of the party chairmen carried on floats, it was a display that would have been recognizable to Mao - or to Joseph Stalin.""This was a very Soviet, very Cold War-style parade packaged for the 21st century,"" said Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at Australian National University. ""China accuses others of Cold War thinking. But this is Cold War acting. And it's not the China that many of us were hoping to see 10 or 12 years ago.""
The firepower on display in Tuesday's parade was certainly remarkable.
""I think it's a little surprising that China was so straightforward,"" said Tong Zhao, a weapons expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing.
The DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missile, which can be armed with 10 nuclear warheads and is on a par with U.S. and Russian missiles, made its public debut at the parade.
China for the first time displayed as many as 16 examples of the DF-17, a medium-range missile that can launch a hypersonic glide vehicle and would be extremely difficult to intercept. Its inclusion in the parade in a signal that the weapon is now operational and ready to be deployed, Zhao said.
There were also H-6Ns, a new version of China's long-range strategic bomber - which has an underbelly reserved for a large ballistic missile, probably to be used against large ships such as aircraft carriers - and JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missiles.""It's possible that they showed us their emerging nuclear triad,"" Zhao said. ""They have land-based, sea-based and air-based nuclear capability.""
The largely indigenous technology also was developed amid a deteriorating international environment for China.
""China's defense industry is independent and complete,"" said Wang Yiwei, a professor of international affairs at Renmin University in Beijing. ""This shows that China is not afraid of any evil pressure when it comes to the so-called China-U.S. trade war.""
American policymakers should view Tuesday's parade positively, Wang said. ""If you are not hostile to China, you should be encouraged by its achievements,"" he said. ""And these weapons and skills are not stolen.""
The weapons also had an important domestic message. Most were developed and deployed under the watch of Xi, who took power at the end of 2012.
""This helps highlight his personal achievement of promoting the dream of having a strong army,"" Zhao said, referring to Xi's pledge to return the Chinese nation to the strength and prosperity it once enjoyed.
""Xi presided over the parade, surrounded by people who were applauding, to send the message that he is popular,"" he said. ""Xi wants to show that he is a great leader and is confident that China will continue to rise.""Meanwhile, Hong Kong highlighted one of Xi's mounting challenges.
Large crowds gathered to protest what they see as China's increasing encroachment on the freedoms the semiautonomous territory is supposed to enjoy, but the demonstrations quickly turned violent. Police fired live ammunition directly at protesters for the first time, seriously injuring at least one.
But none of this was visible in the mainland. Coverage in Chinese state media - which accounts for almost all Chinese media - was full of reports about national unity and the miracle of China's development.
Any discussion of the events in Hong Kong was swiftly removed from China's parallel Internet and social media accounts. The top Hong Kong-related news on Baidu, the Chinese search engine, was about Chinese flag-raising ceremonies in the territory and what it described as the strong sense of patriotism toward China the residents there feel.
""They have shut down any leakage of information and have convinced the population that the 'black hands' of foreign powers are behind these protests,"" said Bonnie S. Glaser, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""That narrative has resonance.""
Indeed, 20-somethings in Sanlitun, a popular entertainment and shopping area in Beijing, said they felt no connection with their peers in Hong Kong.
""Hong Kong youth have never experienced hardships,"" said one 23-year-old real estate agency worker during a break, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ""They want to live like foreigners, but they are Chinese.""
A 22-year-old sitting outside a hipster clothing store echoed that view.
""It's always good to have more rights and freedoms, but I think as a mainlander we already enjoy the fruits of economic development,"" she said, also speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of political discussions. ""But we should not create trouble for our government.""
With this absence of spillover into the mainland, and mindful of the extraordinary damage that intervening in Hong Kong could do to his political standing, Xi remains unlikely to send in troops to quell the protests, Glaser said.
""Instead, he's sending a signal to Hong Kong and Taiwan, to all of China's neighbors and to the West, that China is making great strides toward becoming a first-tier military power,"" she said.

A clash between profit and principle,"APPLE CHIEF EXECUTIVE Tim Cook has said that ""companies should have values, just like people do."" He's right. But it is difficult to champion democratic values while doing business in a country that runs on speech-stifling authoritarianism.
China is Apple's third-largest market, and it brings the company $44 billion per year in sales, plus countless ethical headaches. Last week brought several, all surrounding the ongoing anti- government protests in Hong Kong. Apple hid the Taiwanese flag emoji from its keyboard for those tapping away on the island. It booted the news outlet Quartz from the Chinese version of its app store after its aggressive coverage of the unrest. And then there was HKmap.live, an app designed for Hong Kongers to avoid law enforcement amid violent crackdowns. Apple, at first, rejected the app. Then it approved it. Then, finally, it removed it. 
Apple says its decision to yank HKmap.live wasn't a matter of capitulation to the Chinese regime, but rather of internal enforcement. The tool's tracking function was abused to attack police, as well as to commit crimes in unpatrolled areas, and that ran counter to Apple's guidelines. But the company's reversal came after the ruling party's official newspaper, the People's Daily, declared that Apple's support for ""toxic apps"" made the company ""an accomplice to the rioters."" 
Quartz was another story. Apple complies with local laws wherever it operates, and President Xi Jinping's laws don't respect press freedom. Apple removed the app because China said to do so, just as it removed the New York Times's almost three years ago.

Apple justifies acceding to despotic demands by arguing that it is the cost of operating in China, and that the Chinese people are better off with a big U.S. firm around than without. Apple and its peers can facilitate a freer flow of information - not to mention better privacy protections, on many of which the company says it will not compromise - than homegrown firms. The question, of course, is how free. Sometimes, corporations might go to the mat for what's right, and sometimes they might win. But, other times, they will lose, and then they are left with a choice to leave China altogether or help warp the world its residents are allowed to see.
When the United States and its allies made the decision to engage with China, they imagined that economic growth and trade would promote political liberalization and a convergence of values. That hasn't happened. Instead, there is competition between vastly different sets of values, and China doesn't hesitate to use the lure of its market to demand fealty to its propaganda line. Apple, the National Basketball Association and other businesses should resist - but they need help. The United States should negotiate not only over soybean purchases and steel quotas but also to protect free speech and other liberties that China would erode."
Hong Kong police intensify efforts to break up demonstrations,"HONG KONG - An unauthorized march against totalitarianism and Beijing's grip on Hong Kong quickly devolved into chaos Sunday, as police fired rounds of tear gas and made arrests to stop the crowd of thousands from protesting - kicking off another day of conflict in what has become the new normal in this global financial hub. 
It was among the most aggressive police responses in the 17 weeks of demonstrations, amid growing sensitivity over the rapidly approaching anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Several people were seriously injured, including an Indonesian journalist based in Hong Kong who was hit in the eye by a projectile while live-streaming the event for her publication.
As police intensify their efforts to crush the protests, they are facing more resistance from ordinary people who are increasingly joining protests and hurling abuse at officers.Despite the forceful police response, the protesters persevered and scattered across central areas of the city. Some set fires, broke windows at subway stations and threw bricks at officers. Street battles broke out between protesters and police, who struggled to keep the demonstrators at bay with rubber bullets and tear gas. 
Residents and tourists were caught in the crossfire, clutching their faces and running in fear in several areas, including the neon-lit luxury shopping district of Causeway Bay. 
About 5 p.m., police launched an aggressive clearance operation against protesters occupying Harcourt Road, where clashes have broken out frequently during the past four months. Police pushed young demonstrators to the asphalt road and dragged them away, leaving pools of blood. Hong Kong's hospital authority said 13 people were admitted to hospitals by 7:30 p.m., including one in serious condition.
The protesters are determined to show Beijing that they wholly reject the erosion of their promised freedoms and see this as their opportunity to push for the right to directly elect the leaders of the city. 
""If they respect us, then we will respect them,"" said Michael, a 28-year-old protester who works in the banking industry. ""But if they don't respect our democracy or human rights, then why do I need to respect them?""
Protesters tore down signs and flags hoisted in advance of the 70th anniversary celebrations, setting fire to some.At times, riot police appeared outnumbered. Shoppers at a luxury mall in central Hong Kong looked on as police and protesters engaged in a pitched battle. Protesters crouched, created a phalanx of umbrellas, and tossed bricks and bottles toward the officers. Police fired round after round of tear gas.
The protesters inched forward as rubber bullets shredded their umbrellas. When it appeared the police might be outflanked, officers made a hasty retreat. Protesters seized the moment, rushing toward officers piling into police vans. 
Demonstrators, cheered by onlookers and fellow marchers, hit the vans with poles and bottles as the vehicles sped away. The road was littered with glass and spent tear-gas canisters clinked across the asphalt as the protesters continued their march. 
At nightfall in the nearby neighborhood of Wan Chai, residents left their homes and workplaces to jeer at police and pelt their vehicles with bricks and bottles.
Police responded by firing tear gas into the crowd, which included elderly residents.
Several protesters were hurt during the day, including one who was briefly unconscious and another who was dragged away by several officers because he couldn't walk. Several bled while ambulances rushed to the scene.Police arrested protesters, lining them up against a wall outside a government building plastered with posters and graffiti denouncing police violence. Officers frisked the protesters and took them away. A spokeswoman for the police force said she could not immediately give the number of arrests.
After one clash, police regrouped and then charged protesters. ""Go, go, go,"" a commanding officer shouted as dozens of tactical and riot officers sprinted down the street. Officers tackled demonstrators, pinning them to the ground and blocking journalists' cameras as they made arrests. 

The protest movement was sparked in June by a bill that would have allowed the extradition of criminal defendants from Hong Kong to mainland China. The bill has since been withdrawn, but protesters' demands have grown to include direct elections for Hong Kong leaders and an independent investigation into police use of force, amid growing sentiment that officers have acted with impunity during the demonstrations. The movement has also taken on a distinctly anti-Beijing flavor.
Protesters have become increasingly aware of the risks of their continued participation in the demonstrations. Police have arrested more than 1,500 people in the past four months with charges including rioting, unlawful assembly, assaulting police officers and possession of offensive weapons. After demonstrations ended Saturday and Sunday, police stopped and searched young people in buses and trams, at convenience stores and elsewhere in the city.

""We can't make fear grow in our hearts,"" said Michael, the 28-year-old. ""If we are not going to go out now, then when?
""If we really lose this time, we may not get the right to come out ever again, just like it is in China."" 
Joshua, a 22-year-old protester, said he grows more afraid before each march. Sometimes he feels like throwing up, he says, worrying that he could be the next to be cuffed and hauled away. He gave only his first name because the demonstration was unauthorized.
""If this is our path to democracy, then it is a sacrifice I am willing to make,"" he said.

Hong Kong skirmishes again turn streets into tear-gas-filled battlegrounds,"Demonstrators marched in defiance of authorities for second day in a row

HONG KONG -
Popular central Hong Kong neighborhoods became foggy battlegrounds Sunday as police for the second day in a row fired tear gas and projectiles at thousands of protesters who were again demonstrating without official authorization.

The clouds of gas left bystanders - including children, tourists and the elderly - choking and sputtering, underscoring the growing risks of Hong Kong's deepening political crisis, now in its eighth weekend. Police said that protesters threw paint bombs, corrosive liquid and bricks at them and that 49 people were arrested.

Protesters had convened to demonstrate against what they saw as police brutality over the course of the protests, including in the neighborhood of Yuen Long the day before. They marched across a nearly four-mile stretch and clashed with police at several points, such as at the iconic Causeway Bay shopping district.
By 7 p.m., police had started firing round after round of tear gas to clear protesters.
Police and protesters alike shouted warnings to residents to close their windows and protect themselves from tear gas. But the noxious gas fired around the trendy Sheung Wan neighborhood just west of central Hong Kong seeped into packed residential buildings, hotels and air-conditioning systems.
The neighborhood is home to Beijing's liaison office, a target of previous protests.
Ed Vinales, a 38-year-old expatriate from Britain, said he was going down the steps of his apartment building on his way to dinner when he caught a whiff of the gas. He said he was more than 100 yards from the clashes.
""I was still within the iron gates, by the security guard, and I could feel the tear gas already,"" he said. He filmed a quick video to post to Instagram and then ""literally ran."" 
""It was very invasive and very surprising,"" he added. 
Others reported the gas seeping into their apartments and fast-food restaurants. 
Police said they had ""liaised with the management of the residential buildings in the neighborhood, and reminded them about the imminent protests and police's prospective actions."" They have also warned people to stay indoors.
Protesters armed themselves with iron poles. Riot police were seen making arrests. A police spokeswoman did not immediately provide details. Four people were injured as of 10 p.m. local time, according to Hong Kong's Hospital Authority.
Hong Kong's escalating tensions were sparked by an unpopular extradition bill that would allow fugitives to be sent to China, and it has deepened as the government has declined to fully withdraw the proposal.
In recent days, protesters have grown infuriated with Hong Kong's police and government, which protesters say are doing the bidding of Beijing rather than protecting citizens and their rights.
On Saturday, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in Yuen Long to voice their anger at violent mobs who a weekend earlier had attacked protesters returning to that area after a huge march. The demonstrations turned into a standoff with police at the railway station where the mobs had attacked the weekend before, leaving trails of blood in the suburban area for the second time in six days.
Police arrested 11 men, ranging in age from 18 to 68, in connection with Saturday's protest ""for offences including unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapon, assaulting police officer and assault,"" they said in a statement.

This weekend's protests, unlike previous marches, were not sanctioned by authorities. Ventus Lau, one of the organizers of Sunday's rally, said the lack of authorization served to worsen the clashes with police.
""No matter if the march is permitted or not, conflicts may still happen,"" he said. ""But the letter of objection [from the police] would only make things worse because everything would be less predictable.""
Police throughout the evening urged demonstrators to leave the scene. But after weeks of sustained and highly coordinated protests, the mostly young demonstrators have become more sophisticated in protecting themselves against potential police action, covering their faces with respirators and wrapping exposed skin in cling film to minimize the sting of tear gas.
Protesters have also become bolder and more provocative against riot police, ripping up bricks from the sidewalks, fashioning shields from metal and wood and setting fires to keep police back. At one point Sunday, a protester wearing a full-face gas mask picked up a canister of tear gas that landed at his feet back and threw it back at officers.
Police said protesters had ""set ablaze a cart with miscellaneous objects and pushed them toward the police cordon line.""
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, one of the main targets of the protesters' wrath, has largely stayed out of public view as tensions have escalated. But she resurfaced Sunday morning to speak at the closing ceremony of a youth military camp hosted by Chinese troops stationed in Hong Kong. 
Lam, appearing with Wang Zhimin, China's top representative in Hong Kong, praised the ""one country, two systems"" framework and urged participants to pass on what they learned at camp to their peers.
Protesters' demands have swelled beyond the extradition bill that sparked the crisis and now include the long-fought demand that Hong Kong directly elect its leader, who currently must be prescreened by Beijing and is selected by a small committee.
""Liberate Hong Kong!"" they chanted Sunday. ""This is the revolution of our times!""

Demonstrators clash with police Sunday."
China is waging war with U.S. businesses. And it's winning.,"Ben Sasse, a Republican, represents Nebraska in the U.S. Senate.
If you want to understand what's happening in the National Basketball Association, turn off SportsCenter and pick up ""The Art of War."" More than 2,000 years ago, the Chinese general Sun Tzu wrote that ""the skillful strategist defeats the enemy without doing battle, captures the city without laying siege, overthrows the enemy state without protracted war."" That's how the NBA lost its recent battle with China, and it's how China has been beating Americans the past few years.
Let's back up.
On Oct. 4, Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted support for Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests. Of course, almost no one in China saw this tweet given that the country's ban on Twitter keeps Chinese citizens in dark. Nevertheless, this small, symbolic gesture of solidarity with human rights-seekers landed the NBA in the middle of the war between Chinese techno-authoritarianism and U.S. democracy.
The Chinese Communist Party mobilized immediately. The Chinese Basketball Association severed ties with the Houston Rockets, Chinese corporations canceled lucrative deals, and CCTV (Beijing's state-run media company) and Tencent (the tech giant that's in bed with Beijing) declared that they'd be blacklisting Rockets games. Millions of viewers and billions of dollars were on the line.
The NBA quickly surrendered. The league pushed Morey to apologize, and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver followed suit. Even worse, Joe Tsai, the owner of the Brooklyn Nets and co-founder of the quasi-state enterprise Alibaba, parroted Beijing's Orwellian spin that Hong Kong protesters are less pro-democracy than they are a ""separatist movement."" 
The NBA has prided itself on free expression. Its players and owners have a well-earned reputation for speaking out on social justice in the United States. Sadly, it seems woke capitalism stops at the water's edge. And this goes way beyond basketball; it is part of Beijing's strategy of corporate encirclement straight out of Sun Tzu.
The Chinese Communist Party and the American people are locked in conflict. We have been for years. Recently, we have fought with cyberweapons and cyberespionage, but the biggest share of this war has been waged with businesses. That's part of the problem.
With a population of 1.4 billion, China is a lucrative market. But getting into that market isn't cheap. At best, the price of doing business in China is silence; at worst, it's reading talking points straight from the Chinese Communist Party. Beijing is not subtle about it.
China is making an example out of the NBA. The Global Times, the government's propaganda newspaper, warned Western businesses that ""global brands better stay away from politics."" In its typical threatening tone, the Communist Party laid it all bare: ""The biggest lesson which can be drawn from the matter is that entities that value commercial interests must make their members speak cautiously.""

The message is inescapably clear: If you're a U.S. company, the only acceptable position is the Chinese Communist Party's position:
The kid in Hong Kong they shot at point-blank range? Don't mention it. The Muslims they torture in re-education camps? Don't object. The threat to Taiwan? Tread carefully.
Let's be clear: The NBA's surrender is nothing new. American businesses have been silent for years as C-suite executives chased Chinese markets for higher profits. But, like Sun Tzu's enemies, we've found ourselves encircled, playing by China's rules and struggling to keep up.
Communists aren't seizing businesses; they're co-opting them. Just last week, Apple took HKmap.live off its App Store after Beijing complained that Hong Kong protesters were using it to organize. ESPN not only warned its employees to avoid talking about the Hong Kong protests but also described the pro-democracy protests as ""anti-government."" Even worse, the network used a propaganda map of China that includes the South China Sea as Chinese territory, despite the fact that U.S. sailors are patrolling there to prevent that annexation. Clothing manufacturers, hotels and airlines have been forced to adopt the Chinese Communist Party's official talking points about its supposed ownership of Tibet and Taiwan.
We've lost the opening battles, but we're not fated to lose the war.
U.S. businesses must step up to the plate and aggressively confront China's intimidation campaign. And if they don't have the courage and integrity to fight back, American consumers should demand that our companies put basic human rights above profit margins. The U.S. government has a role to play, too; Washington needs to stem the rising tide of Chinese intellectual property theft and cyberattacks so that we can empower American businesses to take a tougher stand. If free and open societies don't wake up to this geopolitical reality, we're going to be encircled before there's time to fight back.
Sun Tzu's ancient maxims don't command our destiny. We're not going down without a fight. We ought to have the courage of our convictions and confidence in our own ingenuity.
After all, that's what America is all about. Either that, or learn Mandarin.

Repression's meme machine?,"TIKTOK IS a meme machine that transforms songwriting teens into stars and turns goofy everyday recordings into viral sensations. It's also owned by a Chinese company. This provenance, coupled with its popularity, has government officials worried.

TikTok has racked up more than 500 million active users in its relatively short life span, surpassing even Instagram in global downloads last year. More than 25 million of these users are American, and many of them are minors. Last month, lawmakers
asked U.S. officials to examine TikTok's data- collection and censorship practices. On Friday, the New York Times reported that a federal panel was reviewing the two-year-old deal that put the American firm that became TikTok under Chinese control.
TikTok's leaders protest that they store local information locally, so whatever data the company has on the behavioral patterns or personal attributes of some of the most vulnerable American citizens are not ""subject to Chinese law."" But it's reasonable to wonder whether TikTok might not comply with targeted intelligence requests from the repressive regime ruling over its parent company ByteDance. TikTok's younger users will be voting in the coming years; down the line, they may hold positions of power. A trove of their information is a valuable asset.
It's also reasonable to wonder about TikTok leaders' claim that they have ""never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content"" - especially in light of The Post's reporting that none of the strife in Hong Kong made its way onto the app's search screens. 
The TikTok anxiety captures a more general concern about China's ability to export its anti- democratic norms. U.S. companies are largely unable to operate in China on their own terms, if they're able to operate there at all. Yet the relationship isn't reciprocal: China seeks to stretch its arms as far as possible and squeeze. Douyin, the mainland's version of TikTok, is heavily censored. The threat is that the censorship won't end where the country's borders do. 
Nowhere is Xi Jinping's interest in worming his regime's way around the world clearer than in the case of Chinese students at U.S. universities; they reside in our physical space but in China's cyberspace. Their actions and communications are monitored, and their media diets restricted. It is difficult enough for any college student to break out of the worldview they grew up with, though that sort of broadening is what college is for. It is almost impossible with a suffocating state building a box around even those citizens who have chosen to leave.
TikTok has enabled an explosion of creativity here in the United States, allowing a rising generation to enjoy some of the early promise of the Internet. It's exactly this promise that China threatens to crush. This government should pull whatever levers it can to ensure that a country that will not allow democracy in is unable to push authoritarianism outward."
Drug dealers are using social media sites to sell steroids,"Drug dealers are turning to Facebook and other popular social media sites to peddle steroids, which are illegal without a prescription, raising more questions about whether the companies are properly policing their platforms.
Those substances are being aggressively sold or marketed through posts and videos on sites including Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter, according to new research by Internet safety nonprofit Digital Citizens Alliance and cyberintelligence firm GiPEC. During the first half of the year, the researchers say, they found more than 100 examples of such pages or posts.
Pages, groups and videos pushing steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs could be found through searching for keywords such as ""Human Growth Hormone"" or ""Humatrope."" Once users land on one of those pages, dealers push using the drugs and may include a way to contact them, such as an email address or WhatsApp number.
Even as recently as this week, more than a dozen Facebook pages, YouTube videos and an Instagram account were selling or promoting prescription steroids and other appearance-enhancing drugs. After a Washington Post inquiry, the social media companies removed the pages and posts for violating their terms of service, which prohibit illegal drug sales.
The posts turn devices into drug dealers, said Tom Galvin, Digital Citizens Alliance executive director. ""Parents should know that,"" he said. Their kids are ""gaining access to this online on sites that are mainstream."" 
The sale of these types of drugs is just the latest example of harmful and illicit content proliferating on social networks. Disinformation, hate speech and illegal sales continue to plague the sites, despite efforts to better moderate content both with thousands of humans and improved algorithms.
Amazon and Google recently were selling firearm and gun accessories on their sites in apparent violation of their own policies. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) YouTube, Facebook and Twitter played Whac-a-Mole after the Christchurch shooting in New Zealand, when the shooter's video surfaced and was disseminated across the Web. And Twitter, Facebook and YouTube recently said they removed hundreds of accounts that appeared to be a concerted Chinese effort at spreading political discord regarding protests in Hong Kong.
That has led some industry critics to question whether the companies are doing enough.
""The model of moderation that platforms use is structurally inadequate to the task,"" said Roger McNamee, a Facebook investor who has become one of the most prominent critics of Big Tech. ""It appears that the moderation is not actually designed to eliminate those things; it's designed to eliminate the political blowback."" 
Facebook, which owns Instagram, said it removes content that violates its policies as it finds it. ""Our Community Standards make it very clear that buying, selling or trading drugs, which include steroids, is not allowed anywhere on Pages, in advertising, or anywhere else on Facebook,"" said Facebook spokeswoman Crystal Davis.
YouTube said it removed 90,000 videos for violating its ""harmful or dangerous policy"" in the second quarter of 2019, and the company works closely with experts, including emergency room doctors and pediatricians, to develop its policies. ""We've been investing in the policies, resources and products needed to live up to our responsibility and protect the YouTube community from harmful content,"" YouTube spokesman Farshad Shadloo said.
Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough pointed to the company's existing policies, which state Twitter can't be used for ""any unlawful purpose or in furtherance of illegal activities."" 
Steroids have previously surfaced as a social media problem. Digital Citizens Alliance first researched the issue in 2013, finding that steroids were being sold on YouTube. Immediately following the report, it appeared the company cracked down. (DCA receives funding from telecommunications, pharmaceutical and tech organizations, as well as some members of the Motion Picture Association of America.)
YouTube, which is part of Google, said it has taken steps to reduce the spread of ""borderline content and videos"" on its site in recent years.
The researchers, including Eric Feinberg, the CEO of New York-based GiPEC, decided to revisit the topic after noticing last year that steroids continued to be sold on the platforms. ""They continue to turn a blind eye,"" he said.
In some cases, the content surfaced to researchers as ""Suggested Pages"" or ""Recommended Videos"" they might like due to their searches. While YouTube has recently launched features attempting to reduce illicit content, it only works on English-speaking videos. The researchers found suggested steroid videos alongside videos in foreign languages such as Arabic, according to images reviewed by The Post.
In one example, a Facebook page called ""Landmarkchem Raw steroid powders, HGH, peptides & semifinished for sale"" offered a variety of steroids via Facebook's ""shop"" function, which is intended to help merchants sell products. The button directed people to the Facebook page of ""Lucky Li,"" whose email address and Skype name were also listed on the page.
The researchers contacted Landmark through an email address found on Facebook, and they were offered a wide range of drugs that are supposed to require a prescription, according to emails reviewed by The Post. The emails also gave instructions for administering the drugs.
The researchers purchased two vials labeled ""Human Growth Hormone,"" a substance that is often abused to enhance muscle mass or athletic performance, and three vials of an anabolic steroid known as Deca-Durabolin, which is available only with a prescription because of potential side effects such as liver damage. The researcher paid about $360 for the drugs via the PayPal-owned platform Venmo. (Such a transaction violates Venmo's terms of service.)
Drug testing showed that the Deca-Durabolin appeared to be legitimate, but the HGH was not - leaving questions about what they were sold.
Steroids can be used to enhance appearance as well as athletic performance. 
""It seems like a cruel irony that the same platforms that are fueling a desire to look like celebrities in the social media age are also the platforms that people turn to reshape their body to look like celebrities,"" Galvin said.
Advocates against steroid abuse are calling on the tech companies to do more to stamp out the sales on their platforms.
Donald Hooton Sr., the executive chairman of the Taylor Hooton Foundation, fights steroid abuse in memory of his son. The new research illustrates just how much the issue of steroid abuse has evolved, he said. His son Taylor, a successful high school student athlete whose death was linked to steroid abuse more than 15 years ago, found his dealer while working out at the local YMCA.
Hooton said he was concerned that parents don't realize such sales could now be happening on their children's devices, and he called on the tech giants to do more.
""There is no doubt in my mind that they've got the capability, engineering skills and the wherewithal to get this crap stopped, to prevent this from going on their platform,"" he added.

"Does Denmark matter? Yes, it turns out.","It has a lovely, wind-swept coastline and a bicycle-friendly capital city. It has some cutting-edge restaurants, internationally competitive companies, impressive wind farms, a spectacular opera house. It regularly tops the list of the world's happiest countries - this year, it came in second, just after Finland, and well above the United States. Still, at this particular juncture in history, maybe it's time to ask: What, after all, is the point of Denmark? 
Or, more precisely: Why do we need a Danish ally? In normal times, I wouldn't have bothered to ask that question, let alone spend even a nanosecond answering it. Denmark has been a formal U.S. ally since it joined the NATO alliance in 1949. For 70 years, nobody has questioned Denmark's strategic importance in the Baltic Sea, its reliability as an ally, its membership of the various clubs that make up the West. But President Trump's ludicrous spat with the prime minister of Denmark - which takes place just as he sets out, once again, for what all assume will be another disastrous trip to Europe - makes me think it's time to go back to basics, to think again about the purpose of U.S. alliances, and not just the alliances with big countries such as Germany or Britain. 
It's true, of course, that some aspects of this bizarre Danish story just reflect Trump's own snowflake hypersensitivity, his mistaken belief in his ability to ""make deals,"" his instinctive dislike of female leaders. But some of it also reflects a very deep scorn for smaller countries, a scorn already made evident by his appointment of an ambassador to Copenhagen who is beyond caricature: a failed actress with a rich husband
; a degree from a chiropractic college that recently was put on probation by an accrediting agency; and a penchant for promoting online conspiracy theories. Trump's lack of interest in the momentous protests in Hong Kong and his support, in 2014, for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, are part of the same pattern. Might makes right, in Trump's 1930s-era brain. If big countries choose to occupy and incorporate smaller ones, then so be it.
This argument can be countered by pointing to the contributions that Denmark has made, in recent years, to U.S. foreign policy. After 1989, the Danes deliberately reconfigured their military, creating expeditionary forces designed to assist the United States. Denmark sent troops to Iraq; in Afghanistan, the Danish army suffered 43 casualties, a higher rate, proportional to Denmark's 5.7 million population, than the U.S. military. Since 1951, Denmark has also hosted an important U.S. air base in Greenland - a self-governing, autonomous Danish territory that is not for sale - and Denmark makes important contributions to modern thinking about informational warfare and cybersecurity, too.
But the real value of Denmark's alliance with the United States lies elsewhere. What really matters, in the longer run, is not merely Denmark's troop contributions but the fact that Denmark - like Portugal, Estonia, the Philippines and Belgium - is not at war with anybody, is not a target for invasion, is not preoccupied by a violent rivalry with one of its neighbors. For a large part of the 19th century, Denmark was in a constant struggle with Germany (look up the Schleswig-Holstein question if you don't believe me), just as France was once at war with Spain, and Japan with Korea. These kinds of struggles - for territory, influence, trade - between big countries and small ones in the world of ""might makes right"" preoccupied leaders, devastated territories and, in the 20th century, mushroomed into the lethal battles of World Wars I and II.
Since 1945, the United States' large and small allies in Europe and the Pacific have ceased to fight one another. Instead, they have agreed to be led by the United States, to abide by U.S.-created systems of mutually beneficial rules of trade, to create vast markets for U.S. companies that would not have been conceivable in the dog-eat-dog, ""might makes right"" world of the past. Small countries such as Denmark are now safe places for long-term U.S. investments. They abide by international commercial agreements. They don't confiscate American property or destroy it in the course of a war.
So, no, it's not a good idea to insult the Danish prime minister or to cancel, arbitrarily, a U.S. presidential visit to Copenhagen. When the United States seeks to project power, in Afghanistan or Iraq, Denmark can be useful. But Denmark's membership in the NATO alliance and the rules-based international order that Trump so dislikes - predicated on a multi-decade truce with its neighbors - is America's golden ticket to security and prosperity.

On the razor's edge,"FIVE MONTHS after anti-government demonstrations first erupted over an extradition law, Hong Kong is on the brink of breakdown. All last week, police fought pitched battles with students who had barricaded university campuses and armed themselves with bricks, firebombs and even bows and arrows. When the students finally evacuated the campuses Saturday, Chinese troops left their barracks to dismantle barricades "" the first time they had taken to Hong Kong's streets during the crisis. Hospitals have treated scores of people for injuries, many of them serious.
 All this is happening in a city once known for law and order, and for the peaceful moderation of its pro-democracy movement. The reason is unquestionable: the implacable hard line taken by the Chinese Communist government and the Hong Kong administration it controls toward what began as peaceful protests.
The demonstrators who first turned out on Hong Kong's streets in June had a simple demand: the withdrawal of a proposed law that would have allowed Hong Kong authorities to arrest and turn over people to mainland authorities. The unrest could have ended quickly had the law been dropped; instead, Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam refused for months to concede, even as tensions steadily escalated.
By now, having been assaulted every weekend by police with tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannon and, most recently, live ammunition, protesters have escalated their demands. They want an independent investigation of police brutality and the dropping of charges against the thousands who have been arrested. Most important, they want Beijing to deliver on the promise it made at the time it took control of Hong Kong in 1997 and allow fully democratic elections for its executive and legislature.
Once again, the regime has taken an uncompromising stand, rejecting any concession. And so the demonstrations have spread from weekends to weekdays, and protesters are increasingly defending themselves from the police with their own violence. That's regrettable. But the students did not initiate the fighting, nor can they end it. The responsibility for de-escalation lies with Beijing. The only way to end the street fighting is for Hong Kong authorities to restrain the police and meet the demonstrators' reasonable demands. 
Unfortunately, the regime probably will resort to more drastic measures of force. If so, the United States and other democracies must be ready to respond. The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which would require an investigation of repression in the city and sanctions against those responsible, is pending in the Senate and could be approved Monday if no senator objects. None should."
Elections loom as new flash point in Hong Kong,"HONG KONG "" A university campus turned into a combat zone of police tear gas and pro-democracy protesters hurling bricks and firebombs Tuesday amid a dramatic surge of violence across Hong Kong that could threaten local elections this month.
The clashes at the Chinese University of Hong Kong "" among the fiercest since demonstrations began in June "" came amid a marathon string of street marches and confrontations that have paralyzed parts of the former British colony.
The violence escalated this week after police gunfire wounded a 21-year-old protester Monday.
The same day, protesters doused a 57-year-old man with a liquid and set him on fire. Both victims remained in the hospital Tuesday.
Authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing must decide whether to go ahead with local elections on Nov.-24. If the vote is not held, many protesters would view it as another sign of the power they wield from the streets.

More questions about the vote were raised Tuesday. The People's Daily, the Communist Party's mouthpiece, published a commentary on its social media accounts that backed Hong Kong's crackdown on demonstrators and said the vote should proceed only if calm is restored in the semiautonomous Chinese territory.
'Only by supporting the police force in decisively putting down the riots can [Hong Kong] return to peace and hold fair elections, to help Hong Kong start again,' it said. Facing escalating threats, it said, Hong Kong's government is 'entitled to regulate the street violence instigated by opposition parties and extremist forces.'
At the Chinese University, a stretch of campus became a no man's land.
Black-clad demonstrators, behind umbrellas and table tops, hurled bricks and gasoline bombs. Police fired rubber bullets and tear gas from across a narrow bridge, releasing stinging pink and orange clouds.
At one point, police offered to stop firing tear gas if students pulled back. Later, however, they deployed a water cannon to the university to force protesters to disperse. Students remained guarding the university through the night, even when police had left.
A university fitness room was converted into a makeshift first aid center to manage injuries. According to the Hospital Authority, 51 people were injured between 7:30 a.m. and midnight on Tuesday, the youngest of whom was a baby. 

Clashes also flared in other spots around Hong Kong, including the City University and central business districts during midday. Near the City University, protesters rampaged through a shopping mall and set a Christmas tree ablaze. 
'Our society has been pushed to the brink of a total breakdown,' Senior Police Superintendent Kong Wing-cheung told reporters. 
Hong Kong's universities are home to thousands of international students, a majority of whom come from mainland China. On Tuesday, the Chinese Students - Scholars Association at City University posted on the Chinese messaging app WeChat that they could provide transportation for students hoping to return to Shenzhen, the Chinese city that borders Hong Kong. Several Chinese students interviewed by The Washington Post were planning to fly back home or were making travel plans.
'I was so scared when I came across the protesters, all in black,' said a mainland Chinese student who was caught in the clashes at Hong Kong's Chinese University, giving only her last name, Yang. 'The sound of bricks being thrown still echoes in my ears.'
Yang, 23, has returned to Shenzhen and said she will return to Hong Kong only when the situation is 'normal.'
The district elections would allow a polarized city to vote in Hong Kong's only relatively free electoral exercise. 
District councilors' responsibilities are largely local, but their seats make up a sizable portion of the committee that selects Hong Kong's chief executive, with the other half handpicked by the Chinese government. The pro-democracy camp hopes to capitalize on public anger at the city's Beijing-backed administration, which has deployed increasing force against protesters demanding full democracy and police accountability.
Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, whose approval rating has plummeted to a record low of about 20-percent, has the support of Chinese leader Xi Jinping. But with that backing comes an expectation that Lam will use necessary means to restore order to Hong Kong, now in its sixth month of demonstrations. 
Since Lam invoked emergency powers to ban the wearing of face masks in public assemblies "" protesters use the masks to protect themselves from surveillance and tear gas "" some lawmakers worry that the government could use the same powers to postpone the election, citing political turmoil, said Dennis Kwok Wing-hang, a lawmaker representing Hong Kong's legal sector.
Fears of cancellation are not unfounded. In recent weeks, authorities have arrested several pro-democracy lawmakers and candidates running for district council seats. Democracy activist Joshua Wong was barred from running. Violence against councilors has increased: Pro-establishment figure Junius Ho was stabbed while campaigning, and the ear of a pro-democracy district councilor was bitten off during a tussle involving a knife-wielding assailant. Jimmy Sham, an organizer of pro-democracy marches and a candidate in the election, was attacked by a gang wielding hammers.

"After video, Hong Kong police in clash with facts","Police are accused of obfuscating about video of protester's beating
HONG KONG - The ""yellow object"" lying on the ground had a distinct shape, evident in the video footage that surfaced later. Certainly, a good portion of it was bright yellow. It appeared to have arms. And two protrusions that resembled legs. Someone had dressed the object in dark-colored shorts.
As Hong Kong police officers swarmed over the object and roughed it up in a dark alley, it appeared to squirm. 
In a city grown accustomed to clashes between demonstrators and police as the government responds to months of protests with tear gas and mass arrests, the incident on Saturday and the official response to it illustrated a breakdown in the relationship between the police force and the public.
https://twitter.com/galileocheng/status/1176188077221433345?s=20"">
The episode underlined a harsh reality in this global financial hub, once admired for its legal system and official transparency. With Beijing asserting increasing control over the city's institutions and Hong Kong's leader refusing to allow an independent inquiry into police behavior, authorities here appear not to fear the consequences of violating protocols intended to uphold the rule of law.
Instead, their approach this week was to obfuscate.
Asked Monday about the incident in Yuen Long, an outlying area of Hong Kong, acting senior superintendent Vasco Williams said footage showed an ""officer kicking a yellow object,"" not a man lying on the ground. 
""We don't know what that object is, but there are other videos that are more clear that show the entire incident,"" he said. ""And there's no malpractice by the police whatsoever."" There was no assault, he added during a heated news conference. 
The man shown in the video being kicked by police was a member of a group that deploys volunteers to negotiate between police and protesters at rallies, the group said. He was later arrested, local media reported.Williams conceded that the case warranted investigation but suggested that the video could have been ""doctored"" - an idea that was quickly debunked.
""Knowing you are being videoed, do you think any officer would be that stupid to assault someone under detention? I don't think so,"" Williams said. Hong Kong's daily police briefings are carried by numerous news outlets and watched by thousands. Nearly as soon as Williams spoke, netizens pointed out that more than a month ago, two officers were arrested after being captured on security footage beating a 62-year-old man restrained in a hospital bed.Hong Kong's police force said it would not comment on individual cases. But it added that the force attaches ""great importance to the behavior of police officers on the use of social media"" and noted that it had issued guidelines on social media usage seven years ago.
Throughout the protests that have rocked the city, triggered by a now-shelved plan to allow extraditions to mainland China, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has refused to countenance an independent investigation into police tactics - one of protesters' five demands.
Those tactics have become more forceful over recent weeks, with police making more than 1,550 arrests and deploying water cannons and stinging blue dye along with tear gas.
A report last week by Amnesty International accused the force of ""reckless and indiscriminate"" tactics, including torture, beatings and other mistreatment of detained protesters. The report followed criticism of the police by the United Nations. 
Asked Tuesday how her government could rebuild trust in the police without a fully independent investigation, Lam said her backing of the force does not mean she ""condones irregularities."" Lam has said the existing police watchdog has her ""full support"" to conduct fact-finding studies, but critics note that the body is headed by an official she handpicked, is packed with her associates and loyalists and is not authorized to call witnesses.
Pressed about the video of the ""yellow object,"" Lam said it would be difficult to opine on ""what is right, what is wrong, what is true, what is fake, because there have been . . . different versions [of] the same incident.""
The police have been under extreme pressure, she said, adding it was ""quite remarkable"" that there have been no fatalities. 
The violence has not been one-way. Hardcore protesters have pelted officers with molotov cocktails and bricks and set up burning barricades to stymie police operations. Others have used slingshots to launch rocks at police and have pestered officers with laser pointers. 
The protests represent a challenge to the authority of Chinese President Xi Jinping, who warned in 2017 that any effort to contest China's sovereignty over Hong Kong was a ""red line."" Although not an independence movement, the protests have come as Xi faces pressure on numerous fronts, including China's trade dispute with the United States, a slowing economy, rising food prices, a recalcitrant Taiwanese administration and accusations of cultural genocide against the Uighur people and other Muslim minorities in China's Xinjiang region.
Chinese authorities appear particularly anxious for calm ahead of Oct. 1, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Protesters are planning to disrupt official events in Hong Kong, where the government has already canceled a fireworks show.
On Tuesday in Hong Kong, a pro-democracy lawmaker, Roy Kwong, was attacked by three masked men as he tried to get into his car. The trio kicked and punched Kwong and recorded the assault on video, according to other lawmakers from the democracy camp.
""The fact the attackers recorded the ambush leads me to believe that the attackers were possibly paid to do this and the video would be needed as proof in order to get paid,"" said James To, a pro-democracy lawmaker.

Vietnam pulls movie 'Abominable' from theaters over South China Sea claim,"Scene in animated film shows map asserting Chinese ownership of sea 
BEIJING - China's territorial ambitions and pop culture have clashed - again. 
Barely a week after a single tweet detonated a firestorm against the Houston Rockets and the NBA, another international incident has erupted. But this time, China is the country being punished. 
It began over the weekend, when moviegoers in Vietnam noticed something shocking on their screens while they were watching ""Abominable,"" an animated film about a girl called Yi in a city that looks a lot like Shanghai. She finds a yeti on her roof and embarks on a journey across China - replete with soaring mountains and fields of yellow canola flowers, not a polluted sky in sight - to guide him home to Mount Everest.
The film was the first co-production between DreamWorks Animation, the American production company owned by NBCUniversal, and Shanghai-based Pearl Studio. The heads of the studios wanted to create a film that would appeal equally to American and Chinese audiences, enabling them to capture the two largest movie markets.
But perhaps the Chinese side went too far in appealing to nationalist tendencies in Beijing.
In one scene, Yi repeatedly walks past a map on a wall, which contains the unmistakable dotted U-shape of the nine-dash line, encompassing a swath of the South China Sea that Beijing claims as its own. Other countries - including the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam - claim rights to the resource-rich sea.
The Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ruled against China in 2016, declaring that Beijing's assertion of sovereignty over the South China Sea has no legal or historical basis.
Beijing rejected the decision and has continued to patrol and build islands in the sea to extend its de facto control over the waterway.
Tensions have grown in recent months as a Chinese survey ship with a coast guard escort has sailed through an area controlled by Vietnam. Vietnam has licensed Russian energy giant Rosneft to explore for oil in the area, prompting protests from China.
So moviegoers in Vietnam, where the film is called ""Everest: Tiny Snowman,"" were outraged to see the dotted line on the map over the weekend. Some shared it on social media, and that prompted officials to take action against the film, which opened in Vietnam on Oct. 4.
""We will revoke [the film's license],"" Deputy Culture Minister Ta Quang Dong told the Thanh Nien newspaper, according to Reuters.Nguyen Thu Ha, the cinema department director, confirmed the action. ""We will be more alert and cautious in future,"" Vietnam Insider quoted her as saying.
Vietnam's main movie-theater chain, South Korean-owned CGV, stopped selling tickets to the film, representative Hoang Hai said. All information and trailers have been removed from its website and YouTube channel.
DreamWorks could not be reached for comment, and Pearl Studio did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
It was not the dotted line's first appearance this month on screens outside China. 
ESPN, the U.S. sports channel, was sharply criticized for using a map showing the line - although it had 10 dashes - when reporting on the furor over a tweet by Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets basketball team. That stemmed from a different territorial sore point: the protests in Hong Kong over Beijing's increasingly heavy-handed governance of the supposedly semiautonomous territory.
The nine-dash line is seldom, if ever, used by anyone outside China, and ESPN was accused of going too far to try to appease Beijing.
Still, the appearance of the nine-dash line - or the friendly themes of ""Abominable"" - have found a generally approving audience in China. Box-office sales have exceeded $14 million, according to Maoyan, China's largest online movie-ticketing service provider. 
""Benefiting from the magnificent Chinese scenery and heartwarming Chinese emotions, the movie has broken through cultural differences as the first animated film produced by China and distributed globally,"" a Maoyan statement said. ""It can be regarded as a new paragon of cultural exports.""
The film has scored 7.5 out of 10 on the Douban review site, China's equivalent of Rotten Tomatoes.
""A good animation. Classic Hollywood story line with strong Chinese characteristics,"" wrote a reviewer using the screen name Sikaodemao. ""Displaying the scenery of the beautiful motherland makes it like a tribute film to the country. But it is highly entertaining and all the kids were laughing.""Another commenter, Tang Xiaowan, was less impressed. ""Chinese skin, American core,"" Tang wrote.
China is a cutthroat market for Hollywood studios. According to Chinese rules, only 38 foreign films are allowed to be shown in Chinese movie theaters each year, fueling competition among studios to make films that will win Chinese authorities' approval.
There have been several examples of movie producers altering scripts to please Beijing. 
When ""Red Dawn"" was rereleased seven years ago, the villains, who were meant to be Chinese, suddenly became North Korean. In the disaster movie ""2012,"" Hollywood added references to Chinese scientists rescuing civilization.
Yin Hong, professor of film and television studies at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said political and economic elements needed to be considered when making co-productions.
""Of course China is actively propelling its movies toward world viewers,"" he said, ""but it's not always easy to get what they want.""

China's sway chills campus speech in 2 Pacific nations,"Australia, New Zealand reassess ties as Beijing backers proliferate 

SYDNEY - Chinese students poured into Australia and New Zealand in the hundreds of thousands over the past 20 years, paying sticker prices for university degrees that made higher education among both countries' top export earners.

Now, as a more-authoritarian China projects its influence deeper into the South Pacific, attempts by Chinese students and diplomats to interfere with anti-Beijing dissidents and stifle free speech on campuses pose an uncomfortable challenge for both U.S. allies. 
The immediate trigger for the flare-ups was mass protests in Hong Kong, which authorities in the semiautonomous Chinese territory are struggling to contain. Protesters there have assailed what they say is the steady erosion in Hong Kong's rule of law, aided by the city's pro-Beijing leaders.
Students, academics and officials in Australia and New Zealand, two of the modern world's older democracies, now find their natural sympathy for Hong Kong's protesters colliding with their nations' economic dependency on Beijing - a weakness the Chinese Communist Party isn't hesitating to exploit.
The most visible flash point is on campus. At universities in the Australian cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Hobart, and in New Zealand, students who support and oppose the Chinese Community Party have spent recent days erecting, ripping down and restoring walls covered with cards and Post-it notes calling for freedom in Hong Kong.
""Beijing's influence on campuses is responsible for widespread self-censorship by universities and academics in Australia and New Zealand,"" said Clive Hamilton, a professor of public ethics at Charles Sturt University in Canberra, Australia, and the author of ""Silent Invasion: China's Influence in Australia.""
""The events of the last couple of weeks on Australian campuses have proved to be a serious escalation of Beijing's interference,"" Hamilton said.
Every pro-democracy protest is countered by Beijing's well-drilled student supporters. When some University of Sydney students proposed a protest Friday - which did not proceed - opponents shared notes on WeChat, the Chinese messaging and social media platform, about how to respond.
""The pro-Hong Kong independence demonstration on August 9 is planned by some forces of Sydney University,"" one person wrote, according to an image taken by a student. ""We will not use force, but will absolutely not sit idly by and do nothing. [We] will fight the separatist forces to the end using legal means. Never make a concession!!""
The person, who could not be reached for comment, added in the message that they had ""reported this to the education section"" of the Chinese Consulate.
After years of feeling fortunate about their economic relationship with China, Australians are starting to worry about the cost. On Thursday, a ruling party lawmaker, Andrew Hastie, compared China's expansion to the rise of Germany before World War II, suggesting it posed a direct military threat.
""Like the French, Australia has failed to see how mobile our authoritarian neighbor has become,"" Hastie wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald.
Hastie's comments ricocheted between Beijing and Canberra, where the Chinese Embassy condemned the former officer in Australia's Special Air Service Regiment, an elite army special forces unit.
""We urge certain Australian politicians to take off their 'colored lens' and view China's development path in an objective and rational way,"" an embassy spokesman said. ""They should make efforts to promote mutual trust between China and Australia, instead of doing the opposite.""
Australia and New Zealand are attractive targets for Chinese influence and espionage operations, analysts say, particularly as the smallest members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance that includes the United States, Britain and Canada.
Paul Buchanan, a strategic analyst based in Auckland, said New Zealand is an ""ideal liberal democratic lab rat"" for China to experiment with ways to use ""the very freedoms and transparency of democratic systems against them.""
Chinese diplomats in Australia and New Zealand appear to be encouraging confrontations by praising counterprotesters.
On July 29, a student at New Zealand's Auckland University was confronted by a group of men who objected to her involvement in adorning a protest site, known as a ""Lennon Wall,"" with messages of support for Hong Kong's demonstrators. 
Cellphone footage uploaded to social media showed one of the men moving aggressively toward the student, who fell to the ground. 
Three days later, the Chinese Consulate General in Auckland published a statement that appeared to support the actions of the alleged assailant and his companions, conveying its ""appreciation to the students for their spontaneous patriotism,"" while condemning unnamed people for ""inciting anti-China sentiment.""
Protests and counterprotests have taken place since, and participants say they have received threatening messages from unknown senders. 
Defenders of free speech say the episodes are a wake-up call. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said last week that officials have reminded their Chinese counterparts that New Zealand ""will uphold and maintain our freedom of expression."" 
Standing up for such values comes at the cost of worsening relations with Beijing, the top trade partner of both countries and a lucrative source of funds for universities, which lack the big endowments of U.S. colleges. China's purchases of iron ore, coal and dairy products have helped power Australia's and New Zealand's prosperity.
The University of Queensland, where punches were thrown at a Hong Kong sympathy protest recently, is so close to Chinese authorities that it appointed the Chinese consul general in Brisbane a visiting professor of language and culture last month.
The consulate then praised the ""patriotic behavior"" of 300 pro-Beijing students after the violent incident, prompting Australia's defense minister to warn foreign diplomats against interfering in free speech.
The university has said that it is committed to freedom of expression on campus.

Among themselves, mainland Chinese students share advice on how to attract sympathetic coverage in confrontations with the left-wing activists they call the ""baizuo,"" a pejorative term for Western liberals that translates as ""white left."" 
""UQ students please be calm, don't resort to violence,"" said a recent post on Weibo, China's Twitter-like service. ""Try to learn from the tricks of those pro-Hong Kong independence activists. If you push me I will fall over. Fake tumble, cry and wail, call campus police. We are too strong, which won't work in the world of baizuo.""
""It's very tense,"" Drew Pavlou, one of the student organizers of the University of Queensland protest, said in an interview. ""It doesn't feel safe. I have had to have security walk me to some classes.""

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern talks to the media in Wellington, New Zealand, on Aug. 5."
"In a healthy democracy, power starts at the top - and the bottom","American political science in the 1990s and 2000s was rife with celebration: The end of the Cold War seemed to herald an ""end of history"" when free markets and liberal democracy were in ascendance. That triumphalism is now overrun by widespread concern and anxiety: After recurring financial crises, rampant economic inequality, and the rise of ethnonationalist violence and authoritarianism around the globe, the ideal of democracy seems more precarious than ever. 
From the protests in Hong Kong to the increasing power of ethnonationalist governments in India and Europe and the troubling overreach of leaders like President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and President Trump in the United States, our global crisis of democracy has never been more apparent or urgent. In their latest book, ""The Narrow Corridor: States, Societies, and the Fate of Liberty,"" political economists Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson hark back to an earlier tradition of postwar social science, asking a fundamental question: What explains the rise and fall of democracy and dictatorship? In so doing, they offer a provocative framework for analyzing our current moment of democratic crisis. At the heart of Acemoglu and Robinson's argument is a central insight that for liberty to flourish, societies require both a strong state and a strong civil society. As the authors write, ""A strong state is needed to control violence, enforce laws, and provide public services that are critical for a life in which people are empowered to make and pursue their choices."" State action is critical to address issues like financial crises and growing inequality, or to dismantle enduring inequities such as caste and racial hierarchies, or to provide social insurance and welfare in a changing economy. At the same time, societies need a strong civil society to hold the state accountable - and to demand that the state deploy its powers in the service of the common good. As Acemoglu and Robinson write, ""Despotism flows from the inability of society to influence the state's policies and actions."" Democracy and liberty, then, thrive in this ""narrow corridor,"" where the right balance between a strong state and a strong civil society ensures a virtuous cycle of mobilization, policymaking and accountability. Put another way, we need a strong enough state to protect against various forms of social and economic domination and unfreedom - but we need that state to be democratically accountable to ensure that we don't fall subject to new forms of political domination instead. 
This framework offers a powerful starting point for understanding the many perils facing aspirations for democracy and liberty today.
First, it helpfully recalibrates our American tendency to collapse debates over freedom into a binary clash between the narrow liberty of ""free markets"" on the one hand, and the economic and political freedoms provided by social-democratic ""big government"" on the other. As Acemoglu and Robinson note, threats to freedom don't stem just from the overbearing state that is the boogeyman of most libertarian attacks on economic regulation. Freedom is also lost when a weak state leaves in place social norms and systems that perpetuate racial hierarchies and economic insecurity - what the authors call ""Paper Leviathans."" In the U.S. context, the authors cite examples like the weakness of a welfare state dependent on public-private partnerships and a fragmented safety net that perpetuates economic and racial inequality. 
Second, Acemoglu and Robinson rightly emphasize that freedom ""cannot be engineered"" through perfect institutional design. Rather, it is a ""messy process,"" requiring mobilization, conflict, pressure and institutional change over time. One need only to look at the accelerating collapse of our intricate American system of checks and balances under the pressures of the Trump presidency to see the truth of this analysis. Constitutional checks and balances are not self-executing, and the abstract appeal to the rule of law is of little force in the face of authoritarian leaders once they achieve a foothold of power. Real accountability and freedom require genuine political power and mobilization from the bottom up. 
Third, Acemoglu and Robinson's framework helpfully puts social movements and civil society back into the picture of democratic consolidation. Progress, the authors remind us, is driven by social movements that mobilize and pressure policymakers to develop new institutions. Think of how labor rights and social insurance emerged from the first Gilded Age, as policymakers had to respond to labor organizing and mass-movement politics - or how today's social movements and their calls for a genuine human right to health care and climate equity and racial justice and student debt relief are dramatically transforming the political conversation. This insight operates in the other direction, too. The authors suggest that the persistence of deep racial and economic inequities in the United States is in part due to the relative insulation of American political institutions from this kind of bottom-up pressure. At the same time, civil society pressure is not always progressive: Demands for equity and democracy provoke backlash, and those backlashes can fuel more authoritarian movements and leaders; the authors cite examples like the rise of fascism in 1930s Europe or Augusto Pinochet's Chile. 
Acemoglu and Robinson illustrate their arguments with abbreviated accounts of political change from across world history, including the early-modern European states, the politics of Lebanon, the rise of the 19th-century Zulu state under Shaka, and China from the Tang to the Qing dynasties. While wide-ranging and provocative, this approach does have its limits. Polities do not oscillate between democracy and authoritarianism as monolithic states of being. Rather, they often house both pockets of democracy and pockets of autocracy. The United States has, arguably, been a robust democracy for white men for a long time, while for many communities of color and working people, it's
more akin to an autocracy, where the combination of unaccountable state power (such as policing or immigration enforcement) and absent state power (such as a missing safety net or lack of worker protections within dominating workplaces) means that democracy is largely an aspiration but not a reality. 
Indeed, fights for freedom are not always so easily collapsed into the civil-society-vs.-political-elites formulation that Acemoglu and Robinson often deploy. Critical battles are more likely to be between different coalitions that include both civil society actors and policy elites, clashing over who is deserving of freedom and what freedom entails. The Reconstruction Amendments that abolished slavery and ensured equal protection and due process for all residents after the Civil War did owe much to pressure from grass-roots abolitionist movements. But these reforms were quickly followed by a sustained campaign of private paramilitary racial violence and official law and policymaking that reasserted racial hierarchy through Jim Crow. Similarly, the institutional changes won by the civil rights movement were undermined quickly by civil society mobilization among white citizens and traditionalists to oppose desegregation, leading to formal policy changes - such as privatization, defunding of the safety net and mass incarceration - that conservative policymakers used to roll back the more radical aspirations for equity. And much of today's crisis of American democracy is very clearly a product of political elites' deliberate dismantling of democratic checks and balances to retain power - whether in the White House, in the GOP Senate or in statehouses like North Carolina's - with the active and mobilized support of key interest groups and civil society actors on the right. 
This raises further questions for defenders of democracy, particularly as we enter a high-stakes period in American politics, facing the prospect of presidential impeachment, a critical 2020 election and a rich debate over a potential 2021 structural democracy reform agenda. What strategies must democratizing social movements use to most effectively jump-start the kind of bottom-up pressure that can force changes in political institutions? For pro-democracy elected officials, bureaucrats and legislators, what structural, institutional reforms should they pursue - beyond simply resistance to autocratic rule - that would yield the most transformative and durable shifts in our social and economic systems to better realize a more inclusive vision of freedom? And what lessons might Americans in the Trump era learn from the social movements of other countries, where bottom-up pressures have been successful in driving anti-colonial, anti-racist, egalitarian and democratizing social change? 
Structures are durable until they aren't, and we are in a moment of sudden plasticity, when our political structure can tip toward freedom or further away from it. While Acemoglu and Robinson do not offer a playbook for today's reformers, their book raises important questions that we will all have to grapple with.

How Democrats can claim the high ground on Iran,"Democratic candidates for president should get smart about the United States' confrontation with Iran: Rather than seek only to restore the 2015 nuclear deal, they should also endorse a broader, new negotiation that addresses Iran's meddling in the region and removes sanctions against Tehran.

The goal should be ""JCPOA 2.0, plus,"" argues Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. That's a reference to the acronym for the accord, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Sadjadpour, perhaps the most knowledgeable Iran expert in Washington, has urged several prominent former Obama administration officials to support this course.

This demand for a wider negotiation makes sense for several reasons: It's a way to get the United States and Iran back to the table to discuss de-escalation of the current confrontation. But it's also a way to force Iran to address a reality that's clear to analysts in the United States, Europe and the Middle East: Tehran's behavior is a source of constant friction in the region; real stability and security won't be possible until Iran backs off. 
The Democrats' stance is important because the U.S.-Iran standoff has now entered a dangerous phase of escalation and brinkmanship. The United States is waging what amounts to economic warfare to pressure Iran into making concessions. Iran has made graduated military moves to increase the cost for the United States - shooting down a drone and, this week, blowing through the JCPOA caps on the enrichment of uranium. 
Iran's leadership, in simple terms, is running a squeeze play. It knows President Trump doesn't want a war as he heads toward an election year. And Tehran is hoping that the Democrats and Europeans pressure Trump to preserve the old status quo without making it pay a price. 
In political terms, the Iranians are hoping that disdain for Trump will be so strong on Democratic debate stages and in European foreign ministries that Tehran will get a pass. But, frankly, that's a bet that nobody should want Tehran to win. 
Iran (like Russia, China and other adversaries) sees the contest for political support in ""information space"" as the opening theater of battle in modern conflict. Tehran wants to use the asymmetry of this battleground to its advantage: The United States is an open society; public opinion flows freely, and if there is one thing Republicans and Democrats agree on, it's that they don't want another war in the Middle East.
Tehran counts on this political pressure to temper the president's rhetoric. Iranians, from the ruling elite to traders in the bazaar, read Trump's comments in May in Japan as a sign of the president's pliability. ""I think we'll make a deal,"" Trump said. ""We're not looking for regime change. I just want to make that clear. We're looking for no nuclear weapons.""
Trump seems to be counting on his ""maximum pressure"" campaign of sanctions to clamp the Iranian economy so tight that the hard-liners give ground in any negotiation. This strategy has two big problems: It puts the United States' European allies in the middle between Tehran and Washington, and it assumes that the Iranian people will compel the regime to make concessions. 
As a closed society, Iran has the seeming advantage that it can suppress both dissent and Western reporting about it. The danger for such closed nations is that strangling dissent can eventually create a domestic pressure cooker. When public anger finally explodes, it can rock society. Look at the millions in the streets of Hong Kong over the past month to protest Beijing's policies, or the protesters in Russia who forced withdrawal of the arrest of a Russian journalist.
There are tiny glimmers of dissent visible behind the Iranian veil. Few publications have regular dispatches from Tehran, but the Financial Times' correspondent there reported recently,
""The economy is contracting and an army of unemployed young people think they have no future in their homeland. The hopelessness is alarming.""

The political danger for Tehran was summarized well in a July 8 speech by former president Mohammad Khatami: ""If people lose faith in reform, gradually the overthrowing mentality will take hold and, God forbid, they might succeed."" 
Democrats could take the high ground in this debate if they made a simple point: We oppose Trump's Iran policy and favor a return to the JCPOA. But we also oppose Iran's destabilizing actions in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. 
It's the right policy, and it's also useful leverage in this crisis. A harder line on the American left would usefully turn the tables.

Xi presides over massive show of military tech to mark party's 70th year,"BEIJING - The Chinese Communist Party marked the 70th anniversary of its rule Tuesday with a grandiose narrative about its past and its future, with leader Xi Jinping presiding over a massive parade full of new military technology and declaring that ""no force"" could stop China's rise.
Although the parade was held to mark a very domestic event - the triumph of Mao Zedong's Communists over nationalist forces and the creation of People's Republic of China in 1949 - it had a clear international message.
The display of new military technologies, including an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching anywhere in the United States, and the defiant rhetoric acted as Xi's response to external pressures.
""There is no force that can shake the foundation of this great nation. No force can stop the Chinese people and Chinese national forging ahead,"" Xi said Tuesday morning in a speech delivered in Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing, on the spot where Mao stood seven decades before.
With multiple counter-rallies taking place in Hong Kong, where a large proportion of the population has been demonstrating against China's encroaching influence, Xi also sent a message to the citizens there.
""Forging ahead, we must remain committed to the strategy of peaceful reunification and 'One Country, Two Systems.' We will maintain the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macau,"" Xi said, referring to the principle that Hong Kong and Macau have a degree of autonomy from Beijing.
Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong who has been under fire from protesters for doing Beijing's bidding, could be seen on the dais overlooking the square during the parade.
Xi also pledged to ""unite the whole country and continue to strive for the complete unification of our country,"" a reference to his desire to bring Taiwan, which Beijing views as a breakaway state, back under mainland control.
Xi, who has been increasingly invoking Mao, again called for the revolutionary ""struggle"" that led to the Communists taking power in 1949 to continue.
""We must continue to consolidate and develop the People's Republic, and continue our struggle to achieve the two centenary goal and to realize the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation,"" he said.
His words were followed by an extravagant display of military firepower, with tanks rolling down the main avenue into Tiananmen Square - the same route they took 30 years before to crush pro-democracy demonstrations.
But neither those events nor the brutalities of the Mao era, which included a famine resulting from the disastrous Great Leap Forward agricultural policy and the purges and violence of Cultural Revolution, were mentioned on Tuesday.
Instead, the Communist Party and its People's Liberation Army put on a staggering display of military firepower. Some 40 percent of the armaments were displayed in public for the first time, according to state media commentary.
These included the DF-41, a three-stage, solid-fuel missile that can carry up to 10 independently targetable nuclear warheads and has a range of about 7,500 miles, putting the entire United States in range.
The DF-17, a short-to-medium-range missile that can launch a hypersonic glide vehicle, was also on display. Analysts say the missile appears to be capable of exceeding the speed of sound and penetrating U.S. missile shields, and has a maneuverable reentry vehicle, so it can shift targets in flight.
There were also multiple new drones on display, including the Sharp Sword, an attack drone that can carry missiles or laser-guided bombs and is expected to enter service before the end of the year.
The parade was ""glitzy"" and showed ""unity and optimism,"" said Adam Ni, a China researcher at Macquarie University in Australia. ""But I think underlying that, there are myriad challenges and tensions, both from within China and from external sources, that are creating the condition for potential dramatic change.""
Despite Xi's posture of assurance, his leadership is coming under intense pressure from both inside and outside the country.
Protesters in Hong Kong show they do not share Xi's ""Chinese Dream"" of ""realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation"" and are pushing for democracy and greater autonomy. They have been demonstrating for 17 straight weeks and held multiple rallies around Hong Kong on Tuesday to underscore their different dream for themselves.
Separately, China's protracted trade war with the United States remains bogged down, with few anticipating Vice Premier Liu He's trip to Washington next week for another round of talks will precipitate a breakthrough.
At home, the economy is tangibly slowing, with growth at its lowest level in more than a generation.
To bolster his leadership, Xi has repeatedly invoked Mao and exhorted the Chinese people to stay true to the ""original mission"" of the Party.
Xi wants to present himself as heir to the ""struggle"" Mao began and discount the leaders who came between them, analysts say. That includes Deng Xiaoping, the economic visionary responsible for China's astonishing transformation in the 1980s and 1990s.
""He wants to draw a straight line between Mao and himself,"" Ni said. ""He wants to say that the revolutionary establishment of the People's Republic of China is now on the threshold of national rejuvenation. It's a very simplified story.""
In 2017, Xi elevated himself to the same level as Mao and Deng in the Chinese Communist pantheon by having his name and the phrase ""Xi Jinping Thought"" enshrined in the constitution.

Protesters force delay on extradition bill in Hong Kong,"Unions, small businesses mobilize as pro-China legislature convenes 
HONG KONG - Tens of thousands of demonstrators stormed key city roads at rush hour Wednesday morning after days of heightened tensions over the government's plan to push forward a bill that would allow extraditions to China, occupying Hong Kong's main arteries for the second time in five years in defiance of Beijing's tightening control. 
The protesters, many young people dressed in black, started surrounding the building that houses Hong Kong's main government offices, the Legislative Council, late Tuesday night. Some pitched tents in a nearby park and on sidewalks, spending the night despite sporadic rain showers. The government has refused to scrap the extradition bill even after an enormous protest over the weekend, which organizers said brought over a million people to the streets.
Just as lawmakers were scheduled to hold a second reading of the bill at 11 a.m., the president of the legislature announced the reading would be changed ""to a later time,"" an apparent response to the demonstrations. A final vote on the measure is expected by June 20.
Earlier that morning, when workers would typically be heading into towering office buildings that define the city's skyline, thousands of demonstrators had streamed into major roads near the Legislative Council complex. 
One female demonstrator, who declined to give her name, said the government's failure to accept protesters' calls for the bill to be dropped meant that protesters need to escalate their actions. 
""We reject the law,"" she said. ""We have a process that involved many people and the government did not listen to us. We need to do more than just standing here and shouting some slogans.""
The showdown cuts to the core of tensions in the former British colony: How much can Beijing set the rules in a place with a history of relative independence, a separate legal code and greater freedoms?
Critics say the extradition change threatens the ""one country, two systems"" framework that has given Hong Kong a degree of political autonomy from Beijing since it was handed back to China in 1997.
The showdown over the bill also marks the most serious political turmoil in Hong Kong since a wave of pro-democracy demonstrations five years ago that led to street clashes and arrests of protest leaders.
Early Wednesday, hours after midnight, a steady procession of demonstrators moved past the Legislative Council complex, which was guarded by police and sealed off by three rows of metal barricades chained together.
Protesters gathered, some pitching tents, in the few spots not blocked by security forces and in other areas along Victoria Harbor despite warnings from Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, not to take ""radical action.""
With a backdrop of Hong Kong's illuminated skyscrapers, a Catholic student association sang hymns and held candles. Another protester waved a British Union Jack. In another part of the city, Sunny Leung, 24, handed out red signs denouncing the extradition bill.
He was doubtful that the demonstrations would sway lawmakers. ""We should at least try,"" he added.
""Maybe we [Hong Kong] will die, but we will not die in silence,"" he said. ""We are protesting until the end.""
Meanwhile, labor unions and small businesses across Asia's financial capital planned more strikes. In a sign of the rising stakes, more than 4,000 aviation employees from various carriers, including the flagship Cathay Pacific Airways, signed a petition requesting to join the strikes.
""I hope schools, parents, organizations, businesses and unions consider things thoroughly before advocating any radical action,"" Lam said Tuesday. ""What good would it do to Hong Kong society . . . and our young people?""
The warning came after Lam told reporters Monday that the government would proceed with the bill, which has galvanized an unusually broad swath of opposition, ""out of our clear conscience and our commitment to Hong Kong.""
Lam's persistence has incensed those opposed to the bill, who accuse her of doing the bidding of Beijing rather than representing the people of Hong Kong.
""Carrie Lam ignored the voice of more than a million of our citizens. It is totally unacceptable,"" said Bonnie Leung, vice convener of the Civil Human Rights Front, which organized Sunday's demonstration and estimated the number of attendees at more than 1 million. ""It's very angering. The Hong Kong people should take this as a test, to test what price Hong Kong people are willing to pay to fight for our cause, to fight for our rule of law.""The bill was scheduled for a second reading by lawmakers Wednesday in the city's 70-seat Legislative Council, which is controlled by a pro-Beijing majority. The president of the legislature, Andrew Leung, said Tuesday that 66 hours of debate would be held, followed by a final vote by June 20.
A petition circulated online called for 50,000 people to gather at the Legislative Council offices in central Hong Kong late Tuesday and surround the building through the night in anticipation of Wednesday's debate by lawmakers. By Tuesday evening, police had already begun cordoning off areas around the offices.
Ip Kin-yuen, vice president of the Professional Teachers' Union, Hong Kong's largest teachers union, urged teachers to join the demonstration and said he would hold discussions over the weekend about a school strike. Other labor unions, including the Hong Kong Social Workers' General Union, had already called a strike for Wednesday.
Hundreds of small businesses - Chinese medicine shops, art supply stores and cafes - with more joining by the hour, took to social media platforms and plastered subway stations with posters to announce that they would shutter Wednesday in support of demonstrators and to allow workers to attend protests. Other business owners said they would allow employees to skip work.
""For the children, for the future, allow us to be brave,"" one bridal shop wrote in a message on Instagram attached to a post announcing its closure.
Bleak House Books, an independent bookstore, said it was closing ""to attend to more pressing matters.""
""Ah that pesky Hong Kong spirit is rearing its ugly head again. Refusing to back down in the face of adversity,"" read a post on Facebook from the shop. ""We stand with our brothers and sisters in their fight for a better Hong Kong.""

Trump and McConnell are failing Hong Kong,"This week marks five months since millions of Hong Kong citizens first took to the streets to demand the basic rights promised to them by Beijing. These are the largest pro-democracy protests in a generation. But the U.S. Senate won't pass a bill showing support for these brave souls, who are risking their lives in defense of the basic freedoms we promised to help them preserve.
The blame for Congress's inaction lies with two men - President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) - who have both helped to thwart progress of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, a bill that would bolster reporting on Beijing's crackdown in Hong Kong and provide for sanctions against those responsible. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the bill unanimously in September. The House of Representatives passed its version of the bill by voice vote last month. 
Now, as Hong Kong protesters cry out for international support, specifically asking for Congress to pass this bill, there's no signal it will reach the Senate floor any time soon. It's not as though the Senate is busy doing other things. So why hasn't McConnell acted? His office won't comment.
""We need to send a clear message to President [Xi Jinping] that the United States stands shoulder to shoulder with the people of Hong Kong as they exercise their democratic rights,"" Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) told me. ""For those who claim to support the people of Hong Kong, they should join us in our calls for the Senate to act on the Human Rights and Democracy Act.""
Several senior Senate aides told me McConnell is doing the bidding of the White House, which does not want to upset Beijing while the final touches are being put on their ""Phase One"" trade deal. Trump reportedly told Xi during a June phone call he would remain silent on Hong Kong while trade talks were ongoing. Reuters reported that Trump delivered a similar message to Chinese trade envoy Liu He in the Oval Office on Oct. 11.
Trump's indifference to the plight of Hong Kongers has long been clear. In August, he referred to the protests as ""riots,"" parroting Beijing's line, and said the United States would not get involved. The State Department has muffled officials from speaking out against Beijing's handling of the crisis. 
But McConnell professes to be on the side of the protesters. In August, he penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal entitled ""We stand with Hong Kong"" and promised to support the bill. McConnell was part of the effort when the original legislation supporting Hong Kong autonomy was passed in 1992.
""It is crucial to recognize that the dynamics that led to this crisis didn't begin in Hong Kong and won't end there,"" McConnell wrote. ""The turmoil is the result of Beijing's systematic ratcheting up of its domestic oppression and its pursuit of hegemony abroad.""
He was right, but now he is silent. Senate aides told me that McConnell is running out the clock by pointing to technical concerns that individual senators have raised about the legislation. The bill's main sponsor, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), tweeted Thursday he soon intends to call for a floor vote, to force all senators to show their cards.
U.S. businesses in Hong Kong have a legitimate concern; if the United States were to revoke Hong Kong's special economic status, U.S. firms' bottom lines could suffer. But the bill doesn't go that far. It requires administration reporting on whether Hong Kong still warrants that status and authorizes targeted sanctions against those in Beijing and Hong Kong who are responsible for the worst abuses.
Of course, the Chinese government is threatening to punish U.S. businesses and scuttle the trade deal if the United States doesn't shut up about its human rights abuses. That's par for the course. Trump is again falling for Beijing's ploy to link the two issues. But that linkage only serves to weaken our position on both.
""The United States needs to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We can stand with the people of Hong Kong and stand up for our trade and economic interests,"" Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.), the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, told me. ""I'm deeply concerned that the Trump administration once again appears to be willing to sell out the people of Hong Kong and their legitimate democratic aspirations.""
Trump believes he needs a trade deal with China, even a bad one, for his reelection campaign. What's McConnell's excuse? He could bring the bill to the floor today, and it would pass with overwhelming bipartisan support. As McConnell himself explained, it's not just about Hong Kong. This is about the United States' role in confronting Chinese Communist Party repression and aggression. 
The people of Hong Kong will fight for their rights, with or without U.S. support. But if we abandon them now, we sacrifice real moral and strategic leverage vis-a-vis Beijing - for soybean sales. Trump doesn't seem to care, so Congress must act.

"Trump has mastered sideline tweeting, not leading","After a week in which the threat of recession rocked global financial markets, his trade war with China showed no signs of progress and the government of Israel got into a nasty dispute with two members of Congress, President Trump went to bed Thursday night with other weighty issues on his mind.
""Great news,"" he tweeted. ""Tonight we broke the all-time attendance record previously held by Elton John at #SNHUArena [Southern New Hampshire University] in Manchester!""
This is the frivolous mind-set of the president of the United States. Trump's statements over the past few days have brought into focus once again something fundamental about him: He has little understanding of what it means to govern. He would rather tweet from the bleachers. 
The 800-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average at the middle of last week and an inverted yield curve (an arcane but much-watched economic indicator) underscored why there is broad and growing concern about the direction of the economy. 
Germany saw its economy contract in the past quarter and other nations' economies appear to be slowing. The U.S. economy has been growing, and the stock market managed to regain some of the ground lost by week's end. But given what is happening globally, how long this extended period of growth can last is a major issue for American families - and a consequential issue for Trump's political future.
The president's trade war with China has contributed to the problems now facing the global economy. Yet the president accepts no responsibility - for his policies, his statements or his tweets, all of which have added to the uncertainty. He has a mixed message: Everything is great, and what isn't great is somebody else's fault.
Trump was reduced again last week to doing what he always does when there is trouble brewing. He attacked others. He hurled more insults at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, a Trump appointee who has become the president's favored whipping boy. He blamed Powell for raising interest rates too high and now for not lowering them quickly or enough. ""The Fed is holding us back,"" he said in one tweet, which inexplicably ended with, ""We will win!""
The Fed wasn't the only institution in Trump's sights as talk of economic problems intensified. He lashed out at another favored target: the media. ""The Fake News Media is doing everything they can to crash the economy because they think that will be bad for me and my reelection,"" he tweeted. 
Does anyone not believe that his principal focus these days is reelection?
Under pressure, Trump backed off his threat to impose a major new round of tariffs on China on Sept. 1, moving the deadline back to Dec. 15. Analysts had warned that the new tariffs, which would hit a broad range of consumer goods, could have had a negative impact on the holiday shopping season in the United States. 
The president offered an upside-down explanation. ""The American consumer is fine with or without the September date, but much good will come from the short deferral to December,"" he tweeted. ""It actually helps China more than us, but will be reciprocated."" 
The president showed the sophistication of his thinking on another China issue, the huge pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong that have rattled the Chinese leadership. ""It's a very tricky situation,"" he explained to reporters. ""I think it will work out and I hope it works out, for liberty. I hope it works out for everybody, including China."" 
The president offered no support for the demonstrators who have been massing for weeks in protest. Nor did he warn China against taking action to put down the protests. Unlike past presidents, he declined to stand for American values or the importance of human rights. He appears unwilling to criticize the Chinese government for fear that it would jeopardize resolving the trade war. For Trump, human rights can wait.
But the president was willing to offer Chinese President Xi Jinping some advice about Hong Kong. Calling Xi ""a great leader"" and ""a good man in a 'tough business,' "" he recommended: ""If President Xi would meet directly and personally with the protesters, there would be a happy and enlightened ending to the Hong Kong problem,"" he wrote. ""I have no doubt!"" 
In another part of the world, Trump decided to stand with the government of Israel against two members of Congress, pressuring the Israelis to block an official visit to their country by Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). 
Trump tweeted that a decision by Israel to allow Tlaib and Omar to enter the country would be showing ""great weakness,"" adding, ""They hate Israel and all Jewish people and there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds. . . . They are a disgrace!""
The two first-term congresswomen, who happen to be Muslim, have been highly critical of Israel and its treatment of the Palestinians. They support the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel. 
But the Israeli government's decision drew sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers and the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said in a tweet that he disagreed ""100%"" with the views of Tlaib and Omar but added, ""Denying them entry into #Israel is a mistake."" 
(The Israeli government later said Tlaib could enter briefly on humanitarian grounds to see her elderly grandmother, who lives in the West Bank. But the government said she would have to sign a pledge not to promote a boycott of Israel. Tlaib declined the offer under those conditions.)
The president has tried to portray Tlaib, Omar and Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) and Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) as the face of a radical Democratic Party and targeted them with a racist tweet urging them to ""go back"" to where they came from, even though three were born in the United States and all are citizens. 
Meanwhile, the president is talking about trying to buy Greenland, a story first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Really.
The president's supporters still love him, as his rally in New Hampshire on Thursday again showed. The president put on quite a show, a rambling discourse that lasted more than an hour and a half and revisited old lines and familiar themes (sometimes more than once).
Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani sent out a series of rapturous tweets about it, comparing Trump with former presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. ""These are masterful performances,"" he wrote in one tweet. ""No one in America can excite a crowd like @realDonaldTrump. . . . This is a unique and potent political weapon.""
Meanwhile, a new Fox News poll of the 2020 campaign showed Trump losing to every Democrat tested. More telling was that the incumbent president did not break 40 percent against any of them. Polls are polls, and the election is more than a year away, but those numbers should concern the president's advisers.
Trump is following the same limited playbook that got him elected. Whether those tactics have the same potency they once did is the question that will determine his and the country's future. Meanwhile, serious problems are in front of him, and he is struggling to find the answers.

A stronger response to Mr. Xi,"THE STANDOFF between Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement and China's Communist rulers continues to escalate. Last Sunday, organizers estimated that 1.7 million people - or nearly a quarter of Hong Kong's total population
- marched through pouring rain to demonstrate their continuing support for the territory's autonomy and to demand greater freedom. Authorities in Beijing responded with more hints of armed intervention, even as militarized police forces conspicuously drilled in the neighboring city of Shenzhen.

The threat of a mainland invasion might be bluffing by the regime of Chinese President Xi Jinping, which surely realizes that it would incur huge economic costs and shred its pretensions to global leadership. Nevertheless, it must be taken as a real possibility by Western democracies, which supported the territory's return to Chinese sovereignty two decades ago on the basis of Beijing's guarantee that its independent legal system and rights of free speech and assembly would be maintained for 50 years.

This weekend's summit of the Group of Seven industrial democracies offers an opportunity for those governments, including the United States, to send Mr. Xi a clear message: If he chooses to crush Hong Kong's democracy movement, there will be far-reaching consequences for China's political and economic relations with the West. The G-7 leaders should make clear that they will not hesitate to adopt punishing sanctions, including the immediate revocation of Hong Kong's special economic status, which facilitates flows of trade and investment to the mainland.
Such a declaration is needed because, until now, the West's response to the Hong Kong crisis has been weak. Official statements, such as one issued last week
by the European Union and Canada and another by the State Department, have mostly stuck to generic diplomatic calls for ""restraint"" and ""deescalation"" and ""dialogue."" While supporting Hong Kong's ""fundamental freedoms,"" neither the E.U.-Canada statement nor
the State Department's explicitly backed the mass protest movement or its entirely reasonable demands.

Worst of all has been the performance of President Trump, who has repeatedly made statements siding with Mr. Xi. In July, he declared that the Communist ruler had handled the protests ""very responsibly"" because ""he has allowed that to go on for a long time."" A couple of weeks later, he called the demonstrations ""riots""
and mused that China might ""want to stop that"" before flashing a green light: ""But that's between Hong Kong and that's between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China.""

Last week, stung by criticism of this blatant abdication, Mr. Trump bemoaned that ""many are blaming me"" before weakly expressing his ""hope it works out for everybody."" He later claimed, ludicrously, that Mr. Xi could end the crisis in 15 minutes if he negotiated with the protesters. Last Sunday, Mr. Trump finally said it would be ""very hard""
to conclude a U.S.-China trade deal if there were a crackdown in Hong Kong, but he disassociated himself from such a response: ""I'm the president, but that's a little beyond me because . . . I think there would be tremendous political sentiment not to do something.""

Mr. Trump's stance may encourage Mr. Xi to believe he will pay little price in the West if he orders a crackdown. That's why G-7 leaders ought to prevail on the U.S. president this weekend to join them in dispelling that impression. They cannot directly defend Hong Kong or its people if China elects to use force. But they can do far more than they have so far to deter Mr. Xi."
Wear some free speech at an NBA game,"Mimi Lee is an organizer of the Torontonian HongKongers Action Group.
Like millions of people around the world, I have been moved by the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong over the past several months and appalled by China's refusal to grant basic rights to Hong Kongers that we take for granted in the West. In recent weeks, the NBA's bowing down to Beijing, instead of supporting the Hong Kong protesters, has been disturbing. 
On Tuesday night, with the start of the NBA season, I plan to join about 100 volunteers in giving Toronto Raptors fans a chance to show their support for those seeking democratic rights in Hong Kong.
As one of the several thousand people in Toronto who were born in Hong Kong, it has been wrenching to watch, from more than 7,000 miles away, how the protesters have been beaten and attacked with tear gas and rubber bullets for seeking freedom from Chinese domination. 
In July, friends and I erected a ""Lennon Wall"" at Toronto's Union Station, where passersby could post sticky notes expressing their support for the Hong Kong protesters. The wall was like one erected during pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in 2014, which was itself an homage to a wall in Prague, dedicated to John Lennon's memory, during the Velvet Revolution against communist rule in the 1980s.

As the Hong Kong protests continued throughout the summer, groups of supporters grew in Toronto and elsewhere in Canada, thanks to social media. But the regime in Beijing apparently has its own supporters in Toronto. When we held a rally for Hong Kong in August, dozens of angry counterdemonstrators tried to drown us out with chants of ""One China"" and ""Hong Kong belongs to China."" That was a little scary, but when the NBA controversy erupted - after the Houston Rockets' general manager tweeted his support for the Hong Kong protesters, and league officials, LeBron James and other well-known players rushed to placate China - we knew we had to do something. 
Heading into the long weekend for the Oct. 14 Canadian Thanksgiving, a friend sent a link to me for an article about a fan of the Los Angeles Lakers - James's team - who planned to distribute thousands of ""Stand With Hong Kong"" T-shirts at the first Lakers' regular-season game on Tuesday. Sun Lared had hoped to raise $20,000 on GoFundMe, and amassed more than $40,000 in pledges. 
""It would be cool if Toronto and L.A. could do a joint action,"" my friend said. Just like that, over the course of 24 hours we got in touch with Lared, who offered helpful tips, and we researched custom T-shirt pricing and launched a GoFundMe page for ""The North Stand With Hong Kong"" T-shirts.
The turnaround time for most of the T-shirt printers we reached was two to three weeks, which we didn't have. We found a printer who could do a rush job of 5,000 T-shirts in a week, and we set a goal of 28,000 Canadian dollars (about $21,000). It was more money than any of us in the group could afford, and there was no guarantee that the GoFundMe campaign would raise enough to cover the cost. We agreed to spread the risk among ourselves. We'd need to have the money for the printer by Oct. 15, the day after the holiday. We had basically three days to raise the funds.
At first, donations only trickled in. Was it because of the holiday weekend and people weren't paying attention, or had we misjudged the public? As we pushed hard on social media, more donations came in and we thought things were going well, but then they slowed down. By Oct. 14, when we had planned to end the campaign, we had a respectable CA$20,000 (about $15,000). But we would need to scale back the number of T-shirts, which was disappointing. 
Then a miracle happened: A Hong Kong newspaper wrote about our efforts, and donations surged. We kept the GoFundMe page going until 7 a.m. on Oct. 15, raising CA$34,000 (about $26,000). Instead of cutting the size of the order, we could increase it to 7,000 T-shirts.
We were delighted, though our online efforts had also drawn a backlash, with much of the criticism asking why we were trying to bring politics into sports. First of all, politics and sports have overlapped for decades, but in this instance with the NBA, politics was already very much involved, including the league's distancing itself from a team executive who had dared to support the Hong Kong protesters and China's threats to end the NBA's lucrative sponsorships and promotions.
If you happen to be in Toronto or Los Angeles on Tuesday and are going to an NBA game, please grab a T-shirt on your way in and put it on, exercising the free speech that is denied to the people of Hong Kong.
The writer is an organizer of the Torontonian HongKongers Action Group."
"Many firms do same as NBA, so lay off","Get off the NBA's back, all you people who want sports to be the children's literature of your lost youth. Somehow, because the Houston Rockets capitulated to their Chinese business partners, the league is now supposed to be a gutless violator of human rights? You better start with General Electric.
Or KFC. Or how about Walmart?
It's more than a little ludicrous for everyone from Ted Cruz to Beto O'Rourke to suddenly hand the NBA and the Rockets the tab for American toadying to authoritarians in Beijing. If they want to draw that line in the sand, they can draw it with any of their favorite dozen American corporations - only that wouldn't be so politically convenient, would it? 
It's easier to hurl righteous outrage and umbrage at a large target such as Rockets star James Harden, who on Monday apologized to China for hurt feelings at the behest of his bosses. ""We love China,"" he said. It's far more pat and satisfying to go all-in at Rockets management for making General Manager Daryl Morey apologize for his tweet over the weekend in support of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. ""I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,"" he said in a statement.
And, boy, isn't it an easy viral sound clip to accuse the entire NBA of ""blatant prioritization of profits over human rights,"" as O'Rourke did, and call it an embarrassment, simply because the league called the incident ""regrettable"" and tried to patch things up with its Chinese counterparts?
You want to be angry at the NBA for cowering in the face of China's authoritarian regime? You want to accuse NBA Commissioner Adam Silver of supporting a murderous dictatorship simply to further business interests in China? Fine. Good for you.
 But understand the NBA is only imitating that smooth move patented by dozens of other fine, flag-waving American corporations in their dealings with China. A half-dozen American corporate sponsors set the template a decade ago at the Beijing Olympics, when they colluded in the silencing of U.S. athletes and were far more directly complicit in a host of human rights violations.
Remember what champs Visa and General Electric were when the Chinese refused to grant entry to American athlete Joey Cheek because he had been too audible of an activist against abuses in Darfur? And how about the courageous support Coca-Cola gave to Chinese dissidents when Beijing authorities cracked down on them in advance of those Games? 
Never forget the standup position Johnson & Johnson took when Steven Spielberg quit as artistic director of the Opening and Closing Ceremonies because Beijing not only failed to honor a single one of the reform promises it had made in procuring the right to host the Games but actually went on a terroristic bender against its own citizens, destroying whole neighborhoods, enlisting slave labor and throwing anyone who didn't like it into a camp.
Ford. GM. Starbucks. Papa John's. All of them do massive business with China. Abercrombie & Fitch. Boeing. Procter & Gamble. Start with them. All of them have long known what the conditions and equations are for doing business in the China market. 
Australian journalist Geremie Barmé, who has covered China for many years, sums it up in a phrase: ""contentious friendship."" 
""To be a friend of China, the foreigner is often expected to stomach unpalatable situations, and keep silent in the face of egregious behavior,"" he has written. ""A friend of China might enjoy the privilege of offering the occasional word of caution in private; in the public arena he or she is expected to have the good sense and courtesy to be 'objective.' That is to toe the line, whatever that happens to be. The concept of 'friendship' thus degenerates into little more than an effective tool for emotional blackmail and enforced complicity.""
Throughout the Beijing Olympics, American companies remained silent. So did IOC President Jacques Rogge. When Rogge finally did open his mouth to protest someone's conduct, it wasn't anyone in China's leaderships. The man he decided to pick was Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, for his bad manners in celebrating too boldly. The outrage at the NBA is more than a little remindful of that.
Yes, the NBA has made a mutually beneficial commercial accommodation with China. There are 800 million Chinese viewers of the league, according to Time, and there is a 30-year media partnership. You have a problem with that or consider it gutless? Then you have a problem with literally hundreds of American companies.

"Amid Hong Kong crackdown, Trump congratulates China on anniversary","President Trump on Tuesday congratulated China on the 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule, a message posted hours after a protester in Hong Kong was shot by authorities in an escalation of force aimed at tamping down mass pro-democracy demonstrations. 
Trump's cheerful commemoration in a one-sentence tweet to ""President Xi and the Chinese people"" stood in sharp contrast to the condemnation aimed at Chinese leadership from fellow Republicans, and it drew condemnation from human rights groups.
China's National Day ""marks 70 years of grim testimony to the Chinese Communist Party's brutality against the Chinese people,"" Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said. ""Democracies should press the Chinese government to respect the God-given rights of its people and uphold the rule of law.""
Trump's message, which some critics read as a tacit endorsement of Xi's authoritarian rule, came as the Chinese leader staged an elaborate military parade and fireworks celebration in Tiananmen Square. It was a display of nationalist propaganda aimed at demonstrating the rising Asian power's strength and influence amid a trade war with the United States. Analysts have called Xi China's most powerful figure since Mao Zedong.
The sustained protests in Hong Kong - an economic hub that has operated under a ""one-country, two-systems"" political rule distinct from the Chinese mainland since the late 1990s - have tested Beijing's willingness to tolerate political expression at a time when Xi has pursued a broad and sustained crackdown on free speech and political dissent.
Yet the demonstrations have drawn little public support from Trump, who has generally refrained from criticizing Beijing on human rights issues as he seeks to negotiate a bilateral trade deal. 
""Odd way to mark the day the world's deadliest regime was established,"" Marion Smith, executive director of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, said in response to Trump's tweet. ""The Chinese Communist Party has been killing and expanding its power ever since. Today its iron grip is strangling the people of Hong Kong.""
Trump's allies defended him Tuesday by emphasizing that the administration has adopted hard-line policies on Beijing on trade and defense after elevating China to a strategic competitor in the U.S. National Security Strategy. 
At a Chinese Embassy reception last year to mark its National Day, Matt Pottinger, then the top Asia policy official in the National Security Council, offered a blunt message to his hosts. The Trump administration sought ""to bring the concept of competition to the forefront,"" said Pottinger, who was promoted this month to become Trump's deputy national security adviser. 
Associates noted that Trump also has made plenty of critical statements aimed at China. One former official pointed to a tweet from the president late Monday in which Trump stated that the United States is ""winning"" the trade war and military competition. 
""Happy Birthday China!"" Trump added in that tweet, which the former official described as a sarcastic note.
Michael Pillsbury, a China analyst at the conservative Hudson Institute who has informally advised Trump on trade, said the president's tweet was consistent with his broader strategy to stand up to Beijing on strategic issues while maintaining a decent personal relationship with Xi.
Trump has followed a similar playbook with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, enacting tough economic sanctions on Pyongyang over its nuclear weapons program while making warm public statements about Kim, whose regime is among the world's most brutal.
Trump ""does not want to start a Cold War with China or seek to overthrow the Chinese Communist Party,"" Pillsbury said. The message of congratulations ""doesn't mean the president is done making statements about China. One tweet does not a summer make.""
During the Obama administration, the State Department offered annual statements of congratulations to China, as well as many other nations, on their national days.
In September 2015, for example, then-Secretary of State John F. Kerry offered good wishes to the country on behalf of President Barack Obama, highlighting the ""warm friendship"" of the two countries. Kerry noted Xi's state visit to Washington a week earlier, which showed ""how much we can accomplish through cooperation.""
A former Obama administration official said Trump's tweet was different, however, because he does not regularly congratulate other nations on their national celebrations and doing so demonstrated his ""misplaced priorities"" in trying to ingratiate himself with Xi.
Diplomatic relations between Washington and Beijing have deteriorated during Trump's tenure as initial efforts at bonhomie have given way to an escalating tariff war. Some in the Trump administration reportedly weighed imposing limits on U.S. investments in Chinese companies and financial markets, according to Bloomberg News, though Trump officials have played down the reports.
Trump has grown increasingly frustrated at the lack of progress on trade talks. In late August, the president appeared to cast Xi as an ""enemy,"" though he has since returned to praising his leadership. 
In a speech last week at the United Nations, Trump offered his strongest show of support for the Hong Kong protesters, stating that the ""world fully expects that the Chinese government will honor its binding treaty . . . in which China commits to protect Hong Kong's freedom, legal system and way of life. How China chooses to handle the situation will say a great deal about its role in the world in the future. We are all counting on President Xi as a great leader.""
But Xi has remained defiant. In his address at the 70th National Day celebration, he declared: ""No force can stop the Chinese people and the Chinese nation.""
Gordon Chang, an author and Fox News commentator who promotes a hawkish view on China, called Trump's tweet of congratulations ""strategically unsound.""
Chang praised Trump's tougher trade policies on China, but he added: ""There are people around the world who look to the president of the United States as a beacon of freedom, democracy and liberty.""

Chinese authorities told the Journal on Friday that press credentials would not be renewed for Chun Han Wong, a Singapore national who has covered Chinese politics out of the paper's Beijing bureau since 2014. Those credentials expired Friday. 
China sometimes withholds or refuses visas to punish international news organizations for what the ruling Communist Party perceives as unfavorable coverage. But the decision amounted to the first time that the Chinese government has effectively banned a reporter from the Journal, a publication generally known for incisive but evenhanded coverage of the country.
Wong was one of two authors of a July 30 report disclosing a far-reaching Australian law enforcement and intelligence probe into Ming Chai, one of Xi's cousins and an Australian citizen. The report, citing Australian officials and casino documents, detailed Chai's lavish spending in resorts owned by the gambling mogul James Packer, and Chai's links to what Australian officials deemed to be a money-laundering front in Melbourne.
The story noted there were no indications Xi knew about his cousin's activities in Australia or that the Chinese leader was implicated in any wrongdoing. Still, Beijing considers the private wealth of top leaders' families to be the most sensitive and taboo reporting subject of all, given the chasm between the Communist Party's ideological rhetoric and the vast, often hidden wealth accrued by elite families since the party turned toward state capitalism in the 1980s.
""We can confirm that Chinese authorities have declined to renew Chun Han's press credentials. We continue to look into the matter,"" a spokesman for Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, said in a statement to The Washington Post.

China's Foreign Ministry, in a faxed statement, said the Chinese government handled affairs concerning foreign news organizations and correspondents in accordance with the country's laws.
""We firmly oppose that a few foreign reporters are maliciously tarnishing China, and we don't welcome such reporters,"" it said.
The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China said in a statement that Wong was the sixth journalist to leave the country under such circumstances since 2013 and condemned the move ""in the strongest possible terms.""
Under Xi's hard-line rule, China has significantly tightened the domestic space for speech and dissent while aggressively ramping up overseas propaganda. Facebook and Twitter this month said they would remove nearly 1,000 state-backed accounts that were spreading disinformation globally about the anti-government protests in Hong Kong. 
After the Journal published the story following a joint investigation with Australian media, the Chinese Foreign Ministry denounced the reporting as ""groundless accusations based on rumors"" and an attempt to smear China.
Wong left the mainland Friday night for Hong Kong.

Hong Kong protester shot as police use live fire,"Escalation of force comes on China's landmark anniversary 
HONG KONG - In a dramatic escalation of force against protesters, Hong Kong police for the first time fired live ammunition directly at demonstrators Tuesday during street clashes as China celebrated the 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule. At least one protester was seriously wounded.
The live fire brought a new level of violence in a city already on edge over alleged police brutality and an erosion of freedoms - all unfolding on a highly sensitive date for China under its leader, Xi Jinping, as he presided over grand military processions in Beijing.
The clashes are likely to provoke a fresh wave of anger on the streets as Hong Kong's unrest spills into its fifth month. Hong Kong leaders, meanwhile, face a possible reckoning over whether to keep ramping up their tactics as protests show no sign of easing and amid a severe breakdown in trust between residents and police. 
In Beijing, Xi used the grandiose anniversary ceremony to boast of China's military and economic power - and its unity.
""Forging ahead, we must remain committed to the strategy of peaceful reunification and 'one country, two systems.' We will maintain the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao,"" Xi said, referring to the principle that the former European colonies have a degree of autonomy from Beijing.But Xi's message faced a defiant counterpoint in Hong Kong.
Hundreds of thousands of protesters - ignoring warnings from authorities - sought to reinforce their stance against Beijing: protect Hong Kong's freedoms and grant it full democracy, or face continued and unending dissent designed to shame Xi as he deals with challenges on multiple fronts.
""It is time to show China they picked the wrong people to bully,"" said Fok, a 24-year-old who spoke on the condition that he be identified only by his last name, as he already has been arrested for protesting. ""This is a war, and we will win it.""
Live rounds
Right after daybreak in Hong Kong, the fire-red Chinese flag was hoisted, accompanied by the Chinese anthem. But because of safety threats, officials watched from inside a convention center. A planned fireworks display also was canceled.
By midday, protesters were carrying Chinese flags with their stars rearranged into swastikas and ripping celebratory banners from buildings. Half of the subway network was closed by Tuesday night, as protests spread to more than a dozen areas.The demonstrations descended into panic and chaos before sundown. Police used huge amounts of tear gas, water cannons filled with stinging blue dye and baton charges to clear away protesters, some of whom were peaceful while others threw bricks and gasoline bombs. Marches earlier in the day had featured families, the elderly and children.
Hong Kong police commissioner Stephen Lo, in a news conference held close to midnight, said police had arrested more than 180 protesters Tuesday, bringing the total arrested since June 9 to nearly 2,000. He said 25 officers were injured in clashes with protesters, some of whom threw a kind of ""corrosive liquid"" at them.
A video filmed by the Hong Kong University Students' Union (HKUSU) Campus TV showed that a protester in the Tsuen Wan neighborhood - dressed in black, wearing a helmet and respirator, and carrying a homemade shield - was shot by a police officer wielding a revolver. The video shows the man swinging a rod at the officer before the officer fired once, at close range.
The shot sent the protester tumbling backward over another officer, who was already on the ground.
Ken Lui, a 21-year-old student at Hong Kong Baptist University and part of the HKUSU Editorial Board, was among those who saw the man, crying out in pain and bleeding from the chest. 
People ""were shouting at the police, asking why they had fired at the protesters,"" Lui said.
Witnesses also saw another protester who appeared to be hit by a live round in his hand in the same neighborhood.
Lo acknowledged that officers fired six live rounds when faced with ""life-threatening situations.""
He also said an 18-year-old male had been shot near his left arm and was conscious when sent to the hospital. The injured man, Lo added, was placed under arrest for assaulting a police officer. The commissioner gave no definitive answer on whether the officer who fired the shot would be investigated. 
A group of Hong Kong police officers speaking privately over the WhatsApp messaging service already had begun discussing how to ""protect and support"" the officer and urged one another not to share his photo, according to an officer who is part of the chat group.
Hong Kong's Hospital Authority said at least 74 people were injured, including two men who were in critical condition. The authority said it had no further details on the man shot by police as shown in the video.
The police did not provide further details on whether there were other injuries from the gunfire.On Harcourt Road, the scene of numerous clashes over the past months, protesters' appetite for risk was on full display. From a pedestrian bridge, riot police fired a barrage of rubber bullets and tear gas into a crowd of people - who ignored it and continued advancing up a steep escalator under the cover of umbrellas. Protesters retreated only when tear gas was so thick it was difficult to see beyond a few feet. 
'Semi-police state'
Carrie Lam, the beleaguered Hong Kong chief executive whom protesters decry as a pawn of Beijing, was not in the city but instead attending celebrations in the Chinese capital. Lam had traveled to Beijing for the anniversary with a delegation of more than 200, including business tycoons and pro-China lawmakers.
The protests started in June as a rebuke against a now-scrapped piece of legislation that would have allowed criminal defendants to be transferred from Hong Kong's independent legal system to mainland China. But perceptions of government inaction and shock over police use of force have turned the movement into a full-blown rebuke of Beijing's tightening control over the city and revived a years-long demand for direct election of city leaders.

Pro-democracy figure and former lawmaker Leung Kwok-hung, who helped organize Tuesday's march after permission was denied, said that Hong Kong resembled a ""semi-police state"" and that authorities had created a de facto ""curfew under sunrise"" by closing subway stations and searching vehicles and people throughout the city.
""Most of the people think it should be a day of mourning,"" he said of China's National Day. ""For 70 years, the Communist regime has killed people. Carrie Lam is a political puppet of China; that's why she has refused the demands and relies on the police force.""
Many protesters heeded a call put out online to tuck in their shirts, an effort to root out undercover police who protesters believe leave their shirts untucked to cover their firearms.
Some of the people in the march wore ""We are Hong Kongers"" T-shirts, a rejection of Chinese identity, and held their hands up showing all five fingers for their five demands. The government has met one of these demands - the withdrawal of the extradition bill - but has declined to make further concessions, including an independent investigation into the police.
Many also focused their efforts on mocking and otherwise defacing portraits of Xi, depicting him as the cartoon character Winnie-the-Pooh and making mock offerings to him as though he were a dead spirit needing to be appeased. Graffiti used expletives to refer to Xi, China and the Communist Party.
A handful of pro-China rallies took place around the city, with people gathering in small groups to wave the Chinese flag and sing the national anthem. At the base of the city's Peak Tram, a historic funicular that is a major tourist destination, Mandarin-speaking visitors posed to snap smiling selfies with riot police. Hong Kong residents predominantly speak the Cantonese version of Chinese.
Word of the protester shot by the police officer spread quickly through groups of demonstrators still gathered at the time. Some gasped, and others were in tears. 
""I can't describe it,"" said Nicole, a 27-year-old consultant who was marching. ""Words can't describe the things happening in Hong Kong."" Like others, Nicole spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fear of reprisals from authorities.
Graffiti was sprawled across much of the city, including some quoting the farewell speech of Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong: ""Now Hong Kong people are to run Hong Kong. That is the promise - and that is the unshakable destiny.""

China wrecks Hong Kong's ideals,"AT THE core of Hong Kong's discontent is a treasured conviction that it has been and will be governed by the rule of law - before the handover to China, and after. Rule of law has been the foundation of Hong Kong's strength as a financial bastion for Asia and marks a clear distinction with mainland China, where a party-state rules above the law. On Friday, China threw a match onto Hong Kong's rule of law, in a fateful and regrettable escalation that shows Beijing has only itself to blame for the deepening crisis.
Hong Kongers did not contest China's takeover in 1997; they simply insisted, patiently, on following the letter of China's promises to preserve their free market and political liberties, including freedom of speech and assembly. When they felt constrained, they protested - but with a certain dignity and reserve. That changed when China tried to ram through a new extradition law this year. Hong Kongers recoiled, fearing they could be dragged into China's arbitrary and brutal system of political repression. Reverence for the rule of law, too, is why they were so outraged by the excessive use of force by the Hong Kong police, once a paragon of their society.
Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam, subservient to China's rulers, on Friday invoked an emergency-powers law not used in more than 50 years - and never since the handover - to outlaw the use of face masks by demonstrators, many of whom have worn them to defy identification and possible prosecution. By turning to an emergency ordinance, which gives her almost unlimited powers, Ms. Lam is taking a wrecking ball to the ideals of Hong Kong. As a practical matter, she could use the ordinance in other ways, such as to impose a curfew to silence the protests, which have only expanded since they picked up steam in June. 
Under pressure from the streets, Ms. Lam eventually withdrew the objectionable extradition law, and, at almost any point, the demonstrators would probably have been satisfied if she had met relatively modest demands for an investigation into police brutality and an adherence to democratic norms. But neither Ms. Lam nor the overlords in Beijing understood this, and the latest crackdown is the most stark evidence yet of their self-defeating miscalculation. They have entirely destroyed the ""one country, two systems"" pledge under which the handover was made. For years, Taiwan, a thriving democracy, has watched - warily - how that pledge would unfold. Now the answer is clear: China will stop at nothing to achieve absolute control.
President Trump, waging a trade war with China, has been equivocal about Hong Kong, saying he does not want to interfere
but also reminding China that it promised to ""protect Hong Kong's freedom, legal system and democratic ways of life."" Congress ought to send a stronger message by approving legislation requiring a review of whether Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous from China to deserve its current special economic and legal treatment from the United States. Ms. Lam's emergency ordinance adds to the growing evidence that China's authoritarian leaders are liquidating Hong Kong's cherished principles."
Fighting China's smears,"A LESSON learned from Russia's use of disinformation and weaponized social media in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign is how it can be both invidious and insinuating, creeping up where it is least expected. Millions of people saw the Russian posts - and did not know they were written in a nondescript office building in St. Petersburg. So it is welcome news that Twitter and Facebook this week took the initiative against Chinese accounts that appeared to be part of a deliberate, state-backed campaign to discredit the Hong Kong protest movement.

Back in the halcyon days of social media, platforms did not want to be policemen. They claimed to be platforms, not nannies. They relied on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which stated: ""No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."" This is a pillar of freedom on the Internet and meant the platforms could not be held liable for posts from third parties. That opened the door to a cornucopia of opinions everywhere - and to malign operations by extreme political movements and authoritarian governments.
Russia tested online disinformation in Ukraine in 2014, then launched a wider campaign to sow disorder in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Later, Twitter found 3,814 accounts controlled by the Internet Research Agency in Russia; Facebook identified 470 IRA-controlled accounts that collectively created 80,000 posts between January 2015 and August 2017, reaching as many as 126 million people.

Now, China appears to be emulating the Russia example. Twitter and Facebook are blocked inside China but have a substantial presence in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory and a hub of information and commerce that has been convulsed by protests this summer over the extent of China's domination. China, through state media and a phalanx of fake individual accounts, flooded this open zone with posts sharply critical of the protest movement. Twitter said it found ""a significant state-backed information operation"" and suspended 936 accounts. It also preemptively disabled a ""larger, spammy network"" of some 200,000 accounts created after the first suspensions but not yet substantially active. ""Covert, manipulative behaviors have no place on our service,"" Twitter said, adding that it would decline ads from state-controlled Chinese media. Facebook took down a smaller number of accounts and did not go after the state-run media.

These decisions cannot have been easy, but they point to a more cautious, mature attitude toward information warfare. No longer can platforms just throw up their hands and say ""not our responsibility."" The underlying values of freedom must be preserved, but to protect that freedom, rules are necessary. This is uncharted territory, but at least Twitter and Facebook have their eyes open. Other services, including Google, the owner of YouTube, ought to quickly follow their example on Hong Kong."
A Czech mayor pushes back against Beijing,"PRAGUE - The mayor of this capital city was shaking hands down a line of diplomats when the Chinese ambassador to the Czech Republic did something decidedly undiplomatic.
He strode to the front of the line, pushing past puzzled envoys holding champagne flutes, and demanded that a top Taiwanese diplomat be asked to leave the mayor's reception - in deference to the one-China policy - or he would walk out himself.
""There is only one China. I am the ambassador,"" Ambassador Zhang Jianmin later recounted to The Washington Post. ""I tried to point out the mistake that he made, and I advised him to correct the mistake.""

But Mayor Zdenek Hrib knew what he was doing. He had worked at a teaching hospital in Taiwan while training to be a doctor and was well aware of China's claim on the island. He refused to accommodate Zhang's request. ""I explained to him we don't kick out guests that we've invited,"" Hrib told The Post.
The Chinese ambassador left.
Months later, even as Beijing is embroiled in a trade war with the United States and facing protests in Hong Kong, Chinese officials and the Czech mayor are still sparring. The feud offers an especially raw example of how Beijing is trying to flex its muscles in Europe - with little tolerance for objections.
China has been investing in Europe in conjunction with its broadly defined Belt and Road Initiative. And it has focused special attention on Central European countries.
""They're looking for a way to project their political influence,"" said Czech Foreign Minister Tomas Petricek.
For many European Union decisions, each country has an equal vote, meaning China needs to win over only a few leaders to nudge E.U. policy in a favorable direction. 
The Czech Republic previously held China at arm's length. The late president Vaclav Havel, a hero for leading Czechoslovakia out of communism, was deeply cautious about Beijing when he was in office, said Pavel Fischer, a member of the Czech Senate and a former Havel adviser.
As Havel sometimes said about China, ""Even an elephant will recognize the courage of a small bird and change his posture,"" Fischer recalled.
But China has been able to make inroads since Havel's death in 2011.Czech President Milos Zeman has met with Chinese President Xi Jinping eight times - an unusual amount of face time for the leader of 10 million people.
Zeman has welcomed Chinese investment and tried to position his country as China's portal to Europe. He even appointed a Chinese business tycoon, Ye Jianming, as an economic adviser. Ye, the chairman of energy company CEFC China, proceeded to buy stakes in a Prague soccer team, a brewery, an airline, a media company and an investment bank.
Meanwhile, China hired former Czech ministers and other retired politicians to press its case in Prague.
""They're trying to rearrange the political arrangements to be more conducive to Chinese interests,"" said Martin Hala, director of Sinopsis, a group that studies Chinese influence in Central Europe. ""Some systems are more resilient than others.""
The relationship has hit some serious bumps.
Ye, the adviser to the Czech president, has not been seen since March 2018, when he was arrested in China for unclear reasons. A top executive at Ye's nongovernmental organization, the China Energy Fund Committee, has been convicted in a New York court for bribing officials in Chad and Uganda. And Ye's energy company has been absorbed into a Chinese state-owned company.
With Ye gone, the Czech president has indicated some disappointment with Chinese promises that have failed to materialize.
""I consider the absence of large Chinese investors a stain for Czech-Chinese cooperation,"" Zeman told China's CCTV broadcaster this year.
Other Czech policymakers have taken a tougher approach toward Beijing. Ultimately, it is Prime Minister Andrej Babis, not Zeman, who is responsible for setting Czech foreign policy. And Babis leans more in the direction of President Trump than toward China.China's Huawei and ZTE are being phased out from Czech government agencies and the country's mobile networks after the Czech Republic's cybersecurity agency issued a warning.
The risk from China is ""unambiguous,"" said Michal Thim, the senior China analyst at the Czech National Cyber and Information Security Agency. ""Such an important system as the mobile network could be taken down in the most extreme threat.""
Zhang, the Chinese ambassador, appealed to Babis. The Chinese Embassy later posted on Facebook that Babis had promised to set things straight. The prime minister denied saying any such thing, and the breach of diplomatic etiquette infuriated the Czechs.
""There might have been some misunderstanding,"" Zhang said. But the agency's warning ""ruins the atmosphere of cooperation,"" he said.
And then there's the Prague mayor, who has stood in opposition to Zeman's Beijing overtures.
Hrib, 38, a member of the insurgent Pirate Party, said in an interview in Prague's art nouveau city hall that he just wants to promote the best policies for his city. All the same, he has embraced his fight with Beijing.
In March, he reinstituted the practice of flying the Tibetan flag from city hall in honor of the 1959 uprising. He allowed an exhibition on city property commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. He hosted the leader of Tibet's exiled government and made an official visit to the Taiwanese capital, Taipei. And he has called for Prague to renegotiate its 2016 sister-city agreement with Beijing, removing the acknowledgment of the one-China principle, which states that China, Taiwan and Tibet are a single country that should be ruled from Beijing.
Hrib said it's not a city's place to recognize countries.
He acknowledged that he developed sympathy for Taiwan while studying and traveling there. He keeps a Taiwanese tea set on his desk, underneath a gigantic map of Prague.The Prague-Beijing fight has had collateral damage.
China canceled a 14-concert tour by the Prague Philharmonic that had been scheduled for the fall. Orchestra leaders say Chinese officials asked them to issue a statement condemning the mayor and embracing the one-China policy. When they refused, the tour was called off, leaving a 10 percent hole into the orchestra's budget. 
""It's because we have 'Prague' in our name,"" said Iva Nevoralova, an orchestra spokeswoman. ""We really don't want to have anything to do with politics.""
Petricek, the Czech foreign minister, said that the fight ""certainly does raise some questions about the prospect of further Czech-Chinese relations, where our cooperation goes.""
Beijing has issued its own warning.
""What they did has severely hurt the sentiments of the Chinese people and undermined the good atmosphere for bilateral relations,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said last month. He demanded that they ""correct their wrongdoing as soon as possible and not recklessly damage overall China-Czech relations. Otherwise, their own interests will be harmed at the end of the day.""
Hrib offered no apology.
The ""one-China policy does not mean that you will do exactly everything that China says,"" he said.
He noted that when Prague city leaders originally signed the sister-city agreement with Beijing, it was with the hope that the Prague Zoo would get a panda.
There's still no panda.
But he said Taipei has offered pangolins.

Pence berates U.S. firms for 'kowtowing' to China on free speech,"Vice president hits Nike, NBA over 'losing their voices' on Hong Kong
Vice President Pence on Thursday sharply criticized U.S. companies for ""kowtowing"" to China's restrictions on free speech, taking special aim at Nike and the National Basketball Association for ""losing their voices"" in a dispute with Beijing this month over pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.
In remarks at the Wilson Center in Northwest Washington, Pence issued a wide-ranging set of criticisms of Beijing's predatory trade practices, jailing of Muslim minorities and military expansionism. In far stronger terms than President Trump has done so far, Pence also expressed solidarity with the protesters in Hong Kong, declaring they ""have the prayers and admiration of millions of Americans.""
But Pence also took time to upbraid U.S. businesses for compromising American values as a cost of doing business in China by acceding to Beijing's demand that they refrain from speaking out on political and social issues.
In doing so, he said, China is ""seeking to export censorship, the hallmark of its regime.
""By exploiting corporate greed, Beijing is attempting to . . . influence public opinion, coercing corporate America,"" Pence said. Those corporations follow the ""lure of China's money by muzzling not only criticism of China's Communist Party but even affirmative expression of American values.""
Turning an eye toward Nike and the NBA, he chastised their responses to Chinese pressure to denounce a tweet this month from Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey expressing support for the demonstrators in Hong Kong. Trump has feuded with former NFL player Colin Kaepernick, a Nike pitchman, and with NBA superstars LeBron James and Stephen Curry over racial issues, to which Pence appeared make an oblique allusion.
""Nike promotes itself as a social justice champion, but when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door,"" Pence said, noting reports that the company had pulled Rockets merchandise from stores in China.
Of the NBA, he said some of the ""biggest players and owners, who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country, lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of the people of China. In siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of that authoritarian regime.""
NBA officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
This month, Trump also criticized the NBA for its handling of the controversy, though the president notably did not condemn China for its pressure on the league.
A business community leader in Washington, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to frankly assess Pence's remarks, said, ""The problem with Pence doing this is not a lot of what Trump is saying or doing is really reinforcing the notion around the world that the U.S. stands for democracy and human rights and all the rest."" This business leader noted that Trump has expressed solidarity with some authoritarian leaders and feuded with U.S. allies.
""He spends most of his time hobnobbing with other authoritarians so it rings a little hollow when you hear it from Pence,"" this person said.
The vice president's remarks at the prominent Washington think tank came after months of deliberations within the administration over the timing and tone of his China address. White House officials had first begun scheduling the address in early June, but it was delayed over fears among some Trump aides that it could adversely affect the administration's trade negotiations with Beijing.
Last week, Trump announced a partial trade deal with China that he said would build trust to work toward a more sweeping agreement, but the ""Phase One"" pact has yet to be agreed to in writing.
Trump has eviscerated China on trade, but he has taken a more muted position on other issues, including human rights, offering only nominal support for the Hong Kong protesters. The president has made no extended comments about China's jailing of more than 1 million Uighur Muslims in northwest China, though this month he authorized the State Department to issue visa restrictions on Chinese officials in response to the abuses.
Despite his harsh words for China, Pence emphasized that while the administration - which elevated that nation to a ""strategic and economic competitor"" in its 2017 national security strategy - does not aim to ""decouple"" the U.S. economy from China's market, the second- largest in the world.
Rather, he said, the United States seeks to engage Beijing ""in a manner of fairness."" On trade, he said, the president ""remains optimistic an agreement can be reached.""

A reminder of China's fragility,"Last Sunday,
according to organizers, about
2 million people marched
in a Chinese city to protest an extradition bill that they labeled Chinese ""
tyranny
.""
If accurate, it would m
ean that 1
in 4
Hong Kongers
was out in the streets fighting Chinese encroachment. While it is difficult to predict what path this story will take, it highlights something we tend to forget: the fragility of the Chinese political system.

China's rise has been something of a miracle. It is, quite simply, the most successful case of economic development in human history. The country's gross domestic product has grown about 10 percent a year for 40 years, moving more than 850 million people out of poverty. This accounts for the vast majority of poverty reduction on the planet. In doing so, China has also proved to be the greatest exception to a near-iron law of politics. 
Decades of political-science research have shown that there is a fairly strong connection between economic growth and democracy. As countries modernize their economies, typically they are forced to also change their societies and, eventually, their political systems to make them more open, accountable and democratic. There are outliers, such as oil-rich countries, which gain their wealth without any need to modernize. And yet, more recent scholarship
has affirmed the basic link: As you get rich, the chances of becoming more democratic increase. 
Not China. Until recently, the main exception to ""modernization theory"" was Singapore, a tiny city-state, viewed as a small hothouse with extremely gifted leaders and thus revealing very little about the rest of the world. Yet China, too, kept getting richer while staying resolutely nondemocratic. In fact, in recent years, the political system has become more repressive, censorship has increased
, and the country's president has dispensed with term limits for himself.

What explains China's almost unique path to wealth without democracy? Yuen Yuen Ang of the University of Michigan argues that over the past few decades, China has actually developed an ""autocracy with democratic characteristics."" She notes that reforms have made the country's vast administrative bureaucracy - once a stagnant, communist behemoth - more nimble, transparent and accountable. These changes should be considered a type of political reform, she argues. 
Ang and others point to China's highly meritocratic political system, in which officials move up through rigorous examinations, evaluations and objective measures of results such as economic growth. This exceedingly competitive system ensures quality and responsiveness, defenders say. Scholars such as Shandong University's Daniel A. Bell argue that such a political model rests on the trust and faith in a mandarin governing class that is a key feature of Confucian societies. 
And yet, one has to wonder. Good bureaucracy is not the same thing as democracy, which centers on the ability to both choose your leaders and throw them out of power. As for Confucian societies, whenever we hear cultural arguments, let's not forget Hong Kong and Taiwan. Both are thoroughly Chinese societies with a strong affinity for democracy, as has been apparent over the past few weeks.
The United States is now quarreling with China on several fronts. In these sorts of geopolitical struggles, Americans often make the mistake of believing that their adversary is 10 feet tall - think of the Soviet Union. First, it's not clear that China is an adversary in the Cold War sense; it may be more aptly described as a competitor. More important, while China has great strengths, it also has weaknesses. 
Consider President Xi Jinping's situation. Growth in China has slowed substantially. It is being bolstered because local governments and state-owned companies are borrowing vast sums of money. The country confronts a future with fewer workers, the consequence of its one-child policy (itself a classic example of the dangers of dictatorship - a centrally directed mistake, implemented with ruthless efficiency.)
But perhaps above all, China has a political system that faces real pressure. In an age of populism and anti-elitism, China is still ruled by a cadre of distant elites. The Chinese Communist Party maintains power through the promise of growth and the application of force. It uses an elaborate system of censorship and increasingly sophisticated espionage on its own people. It faces a populace that is not genetically or culturally different from those in Taiwan and Hong Kong - where millions are making clear that they don't want just good government or clever bureaucrats but democracy. It might well turn out that the trade war with the United States is one of Xi's lesser problems.

G-7 braces for its next encounter with Trump,"Like an annual holiday gathering where the main goal is to get through the day without a family explosion, one of France's main objectives as host of this weekend's Group of Seven summit is to minimize the chances that President Trump will blow it up.
Subjects on which to tread lightly include some of the biggest problems the world's major economies are facing - including trade, the system of international rules that has ordered the democratic world for decades and climate change, according to U.S. and other G-7 officials.
Already, Trump has shaken up the schedule, calling at the last minute for a special meeting Sunday morning to discuss the global economy. Senior administration officials said he will contrast U.S. growth with Europe's economic doldrums and press his pro-jobs and ""fair"" trade messages.
Trump planned to ""frankly"" discuss sticking points among G-7 nations including trade, a digital services tax and NATO spending obligations, the officials told reporters in a Thursday briefing.It is unclear how receptive the others will be to whatever thoughts Trump might offer as to how they should shift their own economic approaches. Many world leaders blame Trump's trade war with China and his threats against Europe and Japan for a major contraction in investment and spending, and are frustrated with what they see as attempts to use weaknesses elsewhere to demand changes he thinks will benefit U.S. companies.
Trump's refusal to agree to a joint view of the climate threat and an agenda to confront it roiled the first two G-7 meetings he attended, in Italy in 2017 and in Canada last year.
France hopes to largely sidestep that issue, relegating substantive discussion on the environment to meetings on Monday that will include invited non-G-7 leaders from Africa and elsewhere.
Unless there is unexpected harmony among the G-7 leaders, there will be no final communique. ""We're not going to focus on a communique if it's not going to work,"" said one European official.
Instead, France is tentatively planning to issue statements by leaders on separate issues and concentrate on seeking consensus on front-burner crises such as Hong Kong, Libya, Syria and terrorism. There will be an effort, with little hope of success, to find a middle ground between Trump's ""maximum pressure"" sanctions on Iran, and Europe's desire to preserve the Iran nuclear deal.
""When countries like Denmark are in the firing line, you just try to get through the summit without any damage,"" said one G-7 diplomat, referring to Trump's cancellation this week of a planned trip there after the Danish government rejected his interest in a U.S. purchase of Greenland.
""Every one of these, you just hope that it ends without any problem. It just gets harder and harder,"" the diplomat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
The Europeans ""are increasingly separating themselves from the U.S."" as they struggle to deal with Trump's unconventional approach to diplomacy, said Heather Conley, the director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""If that's formulating a six-plus-one, they will do that. If that is looking to other, more-flexible calibrations to get their interests done, they will do that,"" she said.
In Canada last year, the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau went back and forth on whether a joint communique was possible, and prepared several alternatives, according to Peter M. Boehm, the senior Canadian diplomat who served as Trudeau's ""sherpa"" for the gathering.
Trump was persuaded to sign a lengthy communique only after the United States was given its own climate paragraph, separate from what the others endorsed. But after leaving the meeting early, Trump withdrew his signature from the entire document, via a tweet sent from Air Force One, in a huff over a perceived slight from Trudeau.
He later told aides that he thought the Canada summit was a waste of time - especially a lengthy discussion about plastic pollution in the oceans, and proposed support for a beach cleanup initiative.
Trump leaves Washington on Friday night for the summit in Biarritz, on the Bay of Biscay near the Spanish border, and the leaders first meet formally at a Saturday night dinner. The gathering, including Britain, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada, France and the United States, is the 45th since the group was formed in 1975. Russia joined in 1998, and it was the Group of Eight for 14 years until the Russians were kicked out after the 2014 annexation of Crimea.
Hosting duties are rotated among the members, and next year the United States will be in charge of setting the agenda. While its core interest remains the global economy, the group has evolved over the years to discuss all manner of international issues of concern to a membership with shared values. Its small size is designed for informality.
""What the leaders really like is the fact they can have an unscripted, fairly freewheeling discussion,"" Boehm said. ""They can feel free to interrupt each other and have a dialogue.""
In their plenary meetings, only the leaders are at the table, accompanied by their individual sherpas - in Trump's case, Kelly Ann Shaw, deputy director of the National Economic Counsel and former National Security Council senior director for international trade, investment and development.
Trump has scheduled separate, bilateral sessions with all of the member leaders, except for Italy, whose right-wing government collapsed this week. He will also meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who will be attending the expanded group meetings on Monday, along with counterparts from Egypt, Rwanda, South Africa, Burkino Faso, Senegal, Australia and Chile.
The president has been briefed for this year's gathering by national security adviser John Bolton and economic adviser Larry Kudlow.
As French President Emmanuel Macron has tried to head off conflict, he sent his chief diplomatic adviser, Emmanuel Bonne, to consult with the White House last week, and spoke to Trump by telephone Tuesday.
John Kirton, director of the G7 Research Group at the University of Toronto, said he was ""somewhat optimistic"" that Macron could navigate dealing with an unpredictable U.S. president and perhaps even find a way to accommodate Trump on climate change.
""Most people are serious enough to know that if you want to waste all your time and energy lecturing the president, 'Donald, say you were wrong' . . . then we all fry and die,"" Kirton said.
Others have far lower expectations. Trump has complained repeatedly to senior aides about having to attend, White House officials said, and sees his planned meeting with Britain's new prime minister, Boris Johnson - considered a potential ally on the world stage - as the only bright spot.
Another G-7 diplomat, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, observed that Trump likes to divide the member countries with spitballs such as his recent suggestion that Russia be readmitted, despite its refusal to reverse its annexation of Crimea. Trump made the same suggestion just before the Canada summit.
""You have to plan going into the summit that he is going to try to divide and conquer,"" the second diplomat said.
Johnson has been having his own problems and may not want to be cast as a fellow disrupter. With Britain in an uproar over Brexit and his majority down to one parliamentary seat, Johnson spent much of this week as a semi-supplicant in Europe visiting Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to try to smooth the path for Britain's imminent departure from the European Union.
The other G-7 members have their own domestic problems. Germany, after riding high for years under Merkel, is facing an economic downturn. Macron's popularity has tanked amid the Yellow Vest labor protests across the country. Scandals threaten to derail Trudeau's reelection bid this fall.
What Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last spring called his ""unshakable bond"" with Trump has been significantly shaken by threats to trade and the U.S. military presence in Japan. Italy's Giuseppe Conte, the man Trump hailed last year as ""my new friend,"" resigned Tuesday.

'I will die with the city': A young woman's chilling message from Hong Kong,"Protester embodies the pro-Democracy movement's resolve
HONG KONG - Every Friday, Alexa dines at home with her father, a single man who she says is unaware of his daughter's secret. Afterward, the 21-year-old college student kisses her teddy bear good night.
Then, as the weekend arrives, she slips out of their Kowloon apartment and hits the streets to join Hong Kong's fight for democracy amid increasing crackdowns by the city's Beijing-backed authorities.

Often, she doesn't return home until Monday morning. When her father asks her whereabouts, ""I tell him I am working late,"" she said. 
Alexa is among the mostly young front-line protesters who have escalated their clashes with police in the former British colony, where Beijing is tightening its grip on local freedoms. Protests erupted in June over the Hong Kong government's now-abandoned plans to allow extraditions to mainland China, but have morphed into a broader revolt encompassing calls for universal suffrage and an independent probe into police use of force.
With Hong Kong's leadership refusing to budge on protesters' demands, few hold hopes of a sustainable political settlement. Rather than leave Hong Kong, Alexa said she has decided to stay and fight - and, if necessary, die.
Alexa - not her real name - said she threw a petrol bomb once to cast off riot police who were pursuing protesters. Other times, she has used traffic cones to smother the choking fumes of tear-gas shells. Protesters' fury has reached a boiling point, she said, as the police response has become increasingly heavy-handed. 
Hong Kong's government routinely condemns violence by protesters. Alexa characterizes the dissidents' tactics as defensive actions against an unaccountable police force intent on inflicting physical harm on her and her friends.
For women, the front line can pose particular safety risks. Reports of demonstrators alleging sexual assault by police have contributed to a drop in the number of female protesters on the front lines in recent weeks, said Alexa, who uses the alias to avoid being tracked by authorities. 
The police have denied the reports and say they have acted with reasonable force when dispersing crowds and detaining protesters. The government has said it is no longer using the San Uk Ling detention center, where some detainees allege they suffered abuse. A video of a protester describing, to a packed university hall, a sexual assault at the center was widely shared this month; police said they would investigate her allegations.
""Some male protesters asked me not to go that close to the police,"" Alexa said. ""But sometimes it feels so unfair - it would be so much better if I were a man.""
Though women account for a minority among front-line protesters, Alexa said it was critical for them to be there. ""I can't stop helping out there just because I am worried about being raped. Everyone has their fears,"" she said.
Alexa shivers whenever she walks through the city's Admiralty district, where large-scale protests and clashes with police have happened, and where she has narrowly dodged arrest.""Every morning, I wonder if I will be arrested, and how I should explain that to my father,"" Alexa said. ""I know what I am doing is technically illegal. But . . . I don't want our future generation to spend their youth, like us, fighting for their freedoms.""
The stakes have risen as the unrest has intensified. An Amnesty International report last month alleged ""reckless and indiscriminate"" tactics by Hong Kong's police.
In late July, Alexa watched riot police beat one of her friends, she said. She was seized by two officers who dragged her by her arms. Other protesters grabbed her feet and managed to free her. But a day later, she said, she was shot just below her collarbone with a rubber bullet. 
""I thought I would die. Before that, I had always thought my last waking moment would be spent on missing my family and friends. But at that instant, I was only concerned about Hong Kong - I want to see true democracy in the city,"" she said.
Then last month, Alexa was in the firing line again when protesters tried to breach a police cordon and officers countered with force. As she tried to aid wounded friends, Alexa felt pain in her legs. She had been shot with a beanbag round.
Alexa said her father didn't notice her wounds, which she concealed beneath her clothing, because he was ""usually exhausted from work"" and she had hidden the medication she was using to treat her injuries. 
Hong Kong's de facto constitution, the Basic Law, provides for the eventual introduction of universal suffrage following the city's return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Yet when China's government proposed electoral restructuring for Hong Kong in 2014, it offered the chance to elect only leaders preapproved by Beijing. 
When protests against the decision fizzled out after 79 days without concessions from the authorities, Alexa, like many young people, felt hopeless and wanted to emigrate.
Not this time.
""I want to fight again,"" she said. ""I don't want to leave for the rest of my life. If the city dies, I will die with the city. This is my home.""

Rockets GM's tweet about Hong Kong irks Chinese,"Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey inadvertently sparked an international incident this weekend when his Twitter post supporting human rights protesters in Hong Kong was met with a swift backlash in China.
Morey, who is in Japan with the team for a pair of preseason games against the Toronto Raptors, posted an image to his Twitter account Friday that bore a simple message: ""Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong."" 
His account was quickly bombarded by angry replies before he deleted the message. Some social media users replied with ""NMSL"" - Chinese Internet slang that means ""your mother is dead"" - and called for Morey, who has been with the Rockets since 2006, to be fired. Others replied by hailing his support for the Hong Kong protesters, who began demonstrating in June in opposition to a proposal to a bill that would allow individuals to be extradited from Hong Kong to China.
Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta hastily issued a response Friday to the growing criticism.
""Listen, Daryl Morey does NOT speak for the Houston Rockets,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization."" In a follow-up statement to ESPN, Fertitta clarified that he was merely intending to quell the ""huge backlash"" with his Twitter post and that ""everything is fine with Daryl and me."" 
But the fallout was just beginning. The Rockets, who drafted Yao Ming No. 1 overall in 2002, are one of the most popular and highest-profile NBA teams in China. The franchise has a Chinese-language website and has designed and worn Lunar New Year-themed jerseys. 
Morey wasn't just an American outsider weighing in on what China views as a domestic matter; he was also the prominent face of a high-profile company with long-standing Chinese ties and legions of Chinese supporters.
The Chinese Basketball Association and Tencent Sports, the NBA's rights holder in China, announced they would cut ties with the Rockets, in statements translated by reporter Yu Fu. The Rockets' Chinese sponsors reportedly followed suit, as did the Chinese Consulate in Houston, which urged the franchise to ""correct the error and take immediate concrete measures to eliminate the adverse impact"" of Morey's tweet.
The backlash put the NBA and the Rockets in an uncomfortable bind: Were they willing to jeopardize their Chinese relationships by standing up for the pro-democracy voices in Hong Kong, or would they bend to the Chinese position on the protest in an effort to maintain their business partnerships? And would Morey become a sacrificial lamb?
By Sunday, the league appeared to be attempting to thread the needle by acknowledging the negative response to Morey's message while stopping short of disciplining him or weighing in on the protests.
""We recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable,"" the statement read. ""While Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals' educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them. We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together."" 
Morey also issued a statement, saying that he ""did not intend to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends"" in China.
""I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event,"" his statement read. ""I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives. I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided, and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention."" 
The NBA has made no secret of its desire to cultivate basketball in China despite the potential for political complications, with Commissioner Adam Silver pointing to the country as an ""enormous opportunity"" at the NBA Finals in June.

Protesters detained as Hong Kong unrest continues to spread,"Demonstrations intensify as thousands support a strike set for Monday

HONG KONG - Police fired tear gas and arrested protesters Saturday as pro-autonomy demonstrations spilled into some of Hong Kong's most popular tourist areas days before a planned general strike after another weekend of unrest.
Separately, a smaller, pro-police rally was held in another area of the city, which saw demonstrators carrying Chinese flags and chanting messages of support for Hong Kong's beleaguered police department. 
Saturday's march - the ninth weekend of sustained protests - deviated from a route authorized by police and went into the tourist-heavy shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui in Kowloon, which looks onto Victoria Harbor. 
Protesters started their demonstration in the Mong Kok area farther north, a neighborhood where violent clashes had broken out previously during pro-democracy protests in 2014 and again in 2016. 
Police arrested at least 20 people on charges including unlawful assembly and assault Saturday night and into early Sunday. There were no details on injuries.
""Resolute enforcement actions will be taken against all illegal and violent acts,"" police said in a statement early Sunday. ""Police are capable and determined to maintain law and order and will not tolerate any violence.""
Protests in Hong Kong appear to be intensifying ahead of a planned general strike on Monday backed by thousands of businesses, airline workers unions, trade unions and others. The deepening crisis was sparked by a deeply unpopular bill that would allow extraditions to the mainland, but it has since swelled into a broader movement opposed to police use of force and the government's handling of the upheaval. It has also reawakened calls for full democracy. 
Hong Kong's government has been under increased pressure to quell the anger. Beijing, meanwhile, has upped its warnings against the upheaval. The Chinese army garrison in Hong Kong released a video this week showing soldiers practicing shooting protesters. Protesters have remained defiant and are encompassing a wider swath of society, including civil servants. 
Protesters on Saturday attempted to occupy roads that were not sealed off for their procession, including a cross-harbor tunnel. At one point, they removed a Chinese flag from a pole and flung it in into the harbor. At night, some set fire to the entrance of a police station and armed themselves with bricks in preparation for a standoff. 
Police warned members of the public not to travel to the areas. Tear gas seeped into surrounding streets and restaurants. Tsim Sha Tsui is where dozens of Hong Kong's luxury hotels and malls are and is popular with tourists. 
The scenes at the competing rallies were in stark contrast.
In Kowloon, thousands of young masked protesters wearing black shouted cries of revolution as they were aided by shopkeepers who handed out free water and snacks and by residents who cheered them on. 
Scuffles broke out at night across parts of Kowloon, including a residential district where people emerged from their homes and cursed at police, pushing a line of riot officers back, according to video from a local broadcaster. None of the residents appeared to have masks, protective gear or even umbrellas - typically used as a shield against riot police.
The park where the pro-police rally occurred was filled instead by predominantly older people dressed in white, speaking a range of Chinese dialects. 
One of the pro-police demonstrators, who gave only his last name, Wong, and who appeared to be in his 50s, was carrying a Chinese flag with him and emphasized that Hong Kong is part of China. 
""The police are correct, the protesters are the instigators and are hitting the police first,"" he said. 
The denunciations of the police have intensified since mob attacks against protesters and bystanders returning from a huge march two weeks ago in Yuen Long. The attacks are suspected to be linked to organized crime groups known as triads. The police took almost 40 minutes to arrive despite receiving more than 24,000 emergency calls, and in that time, more than 40 people were hurt, some seriously. 
Samson Chan, a 50-year old assistant to a Hong Kong district councilor, was again on the front lines on Saturday. Every weekend, he has helped to mediate between police and protesters, urging restraint from both. Last weekend, Chan was hit in the back of the head by a projectile. He was left bloodied, was hospitalized and required seven stitches. He is still unclear on whether it was thrown by police or protesters.
Over the past week, police have appeared at his home to arrest him for participating in an unlawful assembly, but he insists he has always played the role of mediator. ""I am not worried about getting injured - I already am injured,"" he said. ""I will not stop protecting our youth.""

China detains American FedEx pilot on suspicion of smuggling ammunition,"HONG KONG - China is investigating an American pilot for FedEx on suspicion of smuggling ammunition, in a case that threatens to deepen troubles for a courier already caught in the crossfire of the U.S.-China trade war.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters Friday that customs officials in the southern city of Guangzhou detained a U.S. citizen Sept. 12 who was carrying 681 airsoft gun pellets in his luggage and planning to travel to Hong Kong.
The pilot was first identified by the Wall Street Journal this week as Todd A. Hohn, a former U.S. Air Force colonel. Hohn was carrying nonmetallic pellets used in low-power replica air guns in a checked bag and cannot leave China pending the outcome of his investigation, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
Hohn is out on bail and under criminal investigation for smuggling ammunition, Geng said Friday.
FedEx confirmed in a statement that a pilot was detained before a commercial flight in Guangzhou. ""We are working with the appropriate authorities to gain a better understanding of the facts,"" the company said.
China has some of the world's strictest gun-control regulations, and even many Chinese are not aware of draconian rules governing replica airsoft weapons, which fire pellets that can leave bruises but are seldom deadly. Chinese state media in 2016 covered the case of a man in Fujian province who was bewildered when he was given life imprisonment after ordering 24 replica guns from the Internet.
Hohn's case adds another pressure point for FedEx in China, where the company faces serious political risks. Chinese officials have opened investigations into the express service since June, and state media have suggested that the company could be placed on a blacklist of ""unreliable"" foreign firms after Huawei, the Chinese technology giant, accused FedEx of misrouting parcels and potential foul play. 
China's proposed unreliable-entities list appeared to be a response to Washington's decision to ban U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei after the U.S. government added the Chinese technology firm to a Commerce Department blacklist.
FedEx said this week that its business outlook for the year has darkened dramatically amid the U.S.-China trade dispute.
Chinese authorities have been investigating FedEx in recent weeks for illegally shipping weapons, including knives, to Hong Kong, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency. FedEx has said the package containing knives never left its origin city - coincidentally, Guangzhou, where Hohn was detained.
All summer, China has accused the United States of covertly fomenting protests and violence in Hong Kong, but has not provided substantial evidence.
Hohn, who left the Air Force in 2017, had passed through security and was waiting in an executive lounge for a Cathay Dragon flight home to Hong Kong when he was detained, the Journal reported.
A protracted investigation into Hohn could add strain to bilateral relations at a time when Western countries, including Canada, Australia and the United States, have accused China of seizing foreign nationals on murky or trumped-up charges to apply political pressure to their governments.

"In China, a critical pork shortage","BEIJING - The most pressing political problem facing China's leaders this week may not be the ongoing protests in Hong Kong. Nor the protracted trade war with the United States.
No, it is probably a shortage of pork - during the Chinese zodiac year of the pig, no less - that has become so severe that the rulers of the Communist Party declared stabilizing pork supply and prices to be an ""important political task."" 
Chinese love to eat pork. Red fried pork. Sweet-and-sour pork ribs. Glazed pork belly. Twice-cooked pork. Pork dumplings. Trotters. Chinese eat an average of 120 pounds of pork a year. Half the world's pork is consumed here.
But with a slew of holidays coming up - starting with this Friday's mid-autumn festival when families get together and feast - officials are increasingly worried that public discontent will overshadow the celebrations.
They are particularly concerned that pork shortages will ruin the ""happy and peaceful atmosphere"" required during next month's commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the biggest event on the Communist Party's calendar this year.
""We should ensure pork supply by all means,"" Vice Premier Hu Chunhua said at the end of last month, adding that China's pork shortages would be ""extremely severe"" in the last quarter of this year and the first half of 2020.
""We must strengthen the guidance and management of public opinion,"" he continued, according to a state media account of his remarks. 
The party, under the increasingly iron-fisted leadership of Xi Jinping, has tightened security and further stifled criticism in the lead-up to the anniversary on Oct. 1, which will be marked by a huge military parade.
To try to mitigate the shortages, Hu declared that the government would release some of its frozen pork supplies. Yes, just as the United States government holds oil in reserve to release in times of crisis, so too does China stockpile pork.
""As far as the government is concerned, the availability and affordability of food is one of the key metrics people use when answering the question 'Are you better off now than you were 70 years ago?' "" said Andrew Polk, an analyst at Trivium China, a Beijing-based consultancy.
""For that reason, the party has a very strong incentive to literally bring home the bacon,"" he said. 
China's porcine problems began a year ago when African swine fever broke out. This led to the culling of almost 1.2 million pigs to stop the spread of the virus, which is highly contagious and fatal in pigs. It is not harmful to humans.
As a result, China's pig herd is down one-third from last year, and its pork production has naturally plummeted. Still, three new cases were reported last month, and the virus has spread to Vietnam and the Philippines. China produced 54 million tons of pork in 2018, according to official statistics, but is expected to produce only 40 million tons this year. Rabobank, the Dutch financial services company, estimates Chinese pork production will fall further to 34 million tons next year.
The widespread culls led to a sudden spike in pork prices. Even since July, pork prices have shot up by 50 percent, reaching record highs of more than $2.25 a pound and easily surpassing the previous record set in 2016.
China's version of the social media site TikTok is full of memes riffing on the price of pork. In one, a customer buys a tiny piece of meat the size of his thumb. In another, a man walks down the street dangling a large piece of pork from a hook, the carnivorous equivalent of bragging about his Lamborghini.
In Xinfadi, the biggest meat market in Beijing, vendors and shoppers alike were downbeat.
Pork prices had risen in August at the fastest pace that Yu, a vendor in her 50s who has worked in the market for about 20 years, could remember.
""This had a big impact on my business,"" said Yu, who declined to give her full name. She estimated that the number of customers is down by a third compared with this time last year.
""There are fewer customers now and people cannot afford to buy pork. They say it's too expensive,"" she said.
Shang Jinsheng, a 68-year-old retiree who was shopping in the market, said she was buying only half as much pork as she used to, and buying more seafood instead.

""I used to buy pork every week; now I haven't bought it for three weeks,"" she said. ""I am on my way to buy shrimp. I'm just passing by to take a look at the pork prices."" 
With the holidays approaching, central and local governments alike are taking action to narrow the gap between supply and demand.
The southern city of Guangzhou started releasing 1,800 tons of frozen pork reserves onto its local market at the weekend, spreading it out over the days until the Oct. 1 anniversary.
In Nanning, near the border with Vietnam, residents can buy pork at a 10 percent discount from the market price. But customers are limited to two pounds of the meat a day, and vendors to selling only one pig's worth. 
The central government has told the provinces that they must be pork self-sufficient. Banks, meanwhile, must not only keep lending to hog farms and slaughterhouses, but they should do so at cheap rates.
Still, the government cannot come up with a quick fix. 
""The pigs can't grow overnight. They need time,"" said Sun, a 45-year-old who owns a stall in the Xinfadi market and declined to give a full name.
To try to make up the shortfall, China's pork imports are forecast to almost triple this year. China imports most of its pork from European countries, but also gets some from the United States.
That makes the trade war with the United States an added challenge. Beijing imposed an additional 10 percent tariff on U.S. agricultural imports in September, taking the duty on imported U.S. pork to 72 percent, and has canceled several large purchases of American pork.
But the government has tried to minimize the impact of the trade war. One official told state-run television that U.S. pork imports make up less than 0.2 percent of the Chinese market.Still, the amount of pork that China imports from the United States has more than halved in the past two years at precisely the time it needs more.
In the meantime, the authorities are trying to turn consumers away from China's favorite meat.
The Life Times, a newspaper affiliated with the Communist Party, even suggested in a front-page special that eating too much pork was not healthy. ""Eat less pork: Both your wallet and your body will thank you,"" the publication wrote on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter.
China's Internet users were not impressed. ""This is a modern version of 'Let them eat cake,' "" responded Jiang Debin, quoting the line often attributed to Marie Antoinette when French peasants ran out of bread shortly before the revolution. ""They are using so-called expert advice to deceive people, but dare not say don't eat meat unless you have money.""

China condemns bill passed by U.S. House supporting Hong Kong autonomy,"Beijing attacks move by House as months-long crisis continues
HONG KONG - China reacted angrily to the U.S. House of Representatives' passage of a bill paving the way for sanctions against individuals who undermine Hong Kong's autonomy, as pro-democracy lawmakers in the Asian financial hub prevented the city's leader from delivering a much-anticipated policy speech in the legislature.
The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, approved unanimously by the House on Tuesday, requires the U.S. government to consider annually whether it should continue to treat Hong Kong as a trading entity separate from mainland China in response to political developments in the city. That special status has allowed Hong Kong to cement its role as an international financial center and exempts its goods and services from the Trump administration's tariffs. 
Concerns about dysfunction in Hong Kong are growing. The disruption of the speech, which leader Carrie Lam was forced to deliver via video Wednesday amid a heavy police presence aimed at deterring protests, underscored how little room officials have to maneuver as pressure mounts for a resolution to the crisis.
China promised Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy until 2047 - a half-century after its handover from British rule, under a ""one country, two systems"" principle - but Beijing has been tightening its grip. Under authoritarian leader Xi Jinping, activists say the Communist Party has gradually chipped away at the rights enjoyed by the people of Hong Kong that do not exist in mainland China, such as an independent judiciary and freedom of assembly. 
After months of clashes between pro-democracy protesters and riot police in Hong Kong sparked by now-shelved plans to allow extraditions to the mainland, the city's government invoked emergency powers to ban masks at demonstrations. The intensifying crackdown on protesters led U.S. lawmakers to support the bill, which needs a green light from the Senate and the White House to become law.
""The extraordinary outpouring of courage from the people of Hong Kong stands in stark contrast to a cowardly government that refuses to respect the rule of law or live up to the 'one country, two systems' framework, which was guaranteed more than two decades ago,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Tuesday. 
On Wednesday, Jimmy Sham - a leader of the Civil Human Rights Front, the group behind huge, peaceful marches over the past months - was attacked for the second time. Four or five men assaulted him with hammers in the Mongkok district, leaving him bleeding from the head, according to the Front. He was conscious when he was taken to a hospital.
Sham, who is running for local elections, is one of several pro-democracy candidates to be attacked in recent weeks. His group has called for another pro-democracy rally on Sunday.
""It is not hard to link this incident to a spreading political terror in order to threaten and inhibit the legitimate exercise of natural and legal rights,"" the Civil Human Rights Front said in a statement.
Earlier in the day, China voiced indignation at what it characterized as U.S. interference, with the official Xinhua News Agency branding the House's move ""arrogant and dangerous.""For Hong Kong, which is tipping toward recession, the bill could portend severe economic consequences. An end to the special trading relationship with the United States would erode the city's advantages as a Western-friendly business hub and a regional base for multinational firms. 
The United States is Hong Kong's second-largest trading partner, with an estimated two-way trade of $69 billion in 2017. It is also the second-largest destination for Hong Kong exports, which amounted to $42 billion.
Other measures passed in the House on Tuesday would prohibit U.S. exports of military and crowd-control gear used by Hong Kong police.
Hong Kong's government issued a lengthy statement Wednesday detailing ways it abides by the ""one country, two systems"" framework. 
""Safeguarding human rights and freedoms is a constitutional duty of the [Hong Kong] government,"" it said, adding that police have acted with restraint and ""in strict accordance with the law."" 
A government spokesman added that ""foreign legislatures should not interfere in any form in the internal affairs"" of Hong Kong. 
Meanwhile, riot police sealed off the city's legislative complex as Lam, the Hong Kong leader, arrived to deliver her annual policy address. 
Minutes into Lam's appearance, pro-democracy lawmakers heckled her and forced her to suspend the speech. Some held signs saying ""Five Demands, Not One Less,"" a reference to protesters' demands, with an image of a smiling Lam holding up bloody hands.Lam ""has killed Hong Kong,"" said Tanya Chan, a pro-democracy lawmaker. ""There is blood on her hands. She has made millions of protesters take to our streets. . . . Hong Kong cannot go back to what it was anymore."" 
In her video address, Lam announced measures to address housing supply and affordability in Hong Kong, the world's most expensive property market. Housing is often cited as a source of discontent, especially among young people who say they are often locked out of an economic system that favors tycoons and the pro-Beijing elite.
The unrest in Hong Kong, Lam said, was a hindrance to economic growth and to the government's work.
""Employees of all trades and sectors, as well as small, medium and large businesses alike, are deeply worried about the prospects of Hong Kong,"" she said. ""People are asking: Will Hong Kong return to normal? Is Hong Kong still a place we can live in peace?""
Absent from Lam's speech was a commitment to a constitutional overhaul that would grant Hong Kong universal suffrage - a promise enshrined in the framework under which China grants the territory autonomy, but one that Beijing has refused to implement in full.

Liu Yang in Beijing and Tiffany Liang in Hong Kong contributed to this report."
China's 70th anniversary means it outlasted the U.S.S.R.,"BEIJING - The Soviet Union disintegrated, Xi Jinping said when he became the leader of the Chinese Communist Party seven years ago, because its leaders changed their ideals and beliefs too quickly and too radically.

""It's a profound lesson for us!"" he said in a speech to cadres in December 2012.

And one that Xi has assiduously put into action as China moves toward a milestone on Tuesday - a huge military parade and other events to mark seven decades since the Chinese Communist Party established the People's Republic of China. 
He learned from the Soviets not to denounce the party's elder statesman and not to try any kind of political opening.
The Chinese Communist Party will reach a moment the U.S.S.R. did not: 70 years in power - one more than the Soviet Union lasted.
""They have now surpassed the Soviet Union, and that really matters to these guys,"" said Randal Phillips, a former CIA station chief in Beijing. ""They have been paranoid ever since the Soviet Union fell, so to endure for longer means a lot to them."" 
The parade will be a manifestation of what Xi sees as China's proper status: a strong and proud country that is not beholden to the capitalist West.
Columns of tanks and intercontinental ballistic missiles will rumble through the streets, and fighter jets and 70,000 doves will adorn the skies. Soldiers will cover exactly one meter with every two goose-steps. More than 300,000 civilians will accompany the floats in the parade.
Xi has ushered the Communist Party to this moment by becoming, as Richard McGregor, the author of a book on the party, puts it, the ""reddest leader of his generation."" Xi is a die-hard follower of Mao Zedong, the Communist Party and the communist canon, and a ""true believer"" in the party's right to rule China, McGregor said. 
When he became China's top leader at the end of 2012, many analysts and Western governments thought that Xi would be a reformer like his father, Xi Zhongxun, who was a peer of Mao's.
Instead, Xi has proved himself to be much more a disciple of Mao - and therefore of Mao's inspiration, Stalin - than a follower of his father's approach.
And he has made the perpetuation of Communist Party leadership his top priority.He constantly espouses the importance of ""loyalty to the center"" - the leaders in Beijing - and ""staying true to the original aspiration of the party.""
""Xi Jinping has reinvigorated ideology to an extent we have not seen since the Cultural Revolution,"" John Garnaut, an Australian analyst of China, said in a speech to Australian officials. ""In Xi's view . . . the cost of straying too far from the Maoist and Stalinist path is dynastic decay and eventually collapse.""
In recent weeks, Xi has been very obviously trying to walk in Mao's footsteps, carrying out guidance tours on farms and in factories in interior provinces. At every turn, he has been talking of the need to continue the ""struggle.""
In a bombastic speech at a Communist Party school recently, Xi impressed that message on the young officials. China's great rejuvenation could not be achieved without a ""great struggle"" to achieve a ""great dream,"" Xi said, calling on the cadres to use their ""combat spirit"" to tackle the many challenges facing the country.
China is richer and stronger than ever before. Its gross domestic product per capita has risen from about $200 at the republic's founding in 1949 to more than $10,000 per head now. The party likes to say that it has lifted 750 million people out of poverty. China now accounts for one-third of global sales of luxury goods.
Xi has channeled resources into modernizing the military, including building China's first aircraft carrier, and the space program. After landing a lunar rover on the dark side of the Moon this year, China hopes to send a probe to Mars next year.
He has also launched an expansionist and aggressive foreign policy centered on his $1 trillion ""Belt and Road"" infrastructure initiative.
China is now the world's second-largest economy and could overtake the United States for top spot as soon as next year. 
But its trajectory has been far from smooth - massive famine, political chaos and the repression of the Cultural Revolution. 
The Xi family experienced this firsthand. Xi's father was purged, and Xi was sent to the countryside, forced to dig trenches and wear a metal dunce cap. But he has said that rather than turning him against Mao, the experience was formative for him as a Communist Party cadre.
Mao was ""70 percent right, 30 percent wrong"" in the way he led, Xi has said.A second period in the republic's history came with the ""reform and opening"" era led by Deng Xiaoping, which sparked China's astonishing economic transformation. But it also involved the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators who massed in Tiananmen Square and around the country in 1989, resulting in hundreds and perhaps thousands of deaths.
""This anniversary is the first chance that Xi has had to really explicitly tie himself to the legacy of the Chinese Communist Party's foundation of the People's Republic,"" said Rana Mitter, professor of Chinese history at the University of Oxford.
To achieve this vision of a strong and confident China, Xi has elevated himself to the same political level as Mao and Deng, adding his name into the constitution and removing presidential term limits so he can theoretically serve indefinitely - undoing an initiative designed by Deng to ensure that China did not return to the kind of personality cult of the Mao era.
To stamp out dissent, the party has cracked down on lawyers, human rights activists and other members of civil society. It has overseen a sweeping campaign to forcibly assimilate ethnic minorities, detaining about 1 million Uighurs in re-education camps in Xinjiang. Xi has steered an anti-corruption campaign so extensive that it has led to the arrest of more than 1.5 million people. 
""The history of the People's Republic of China is one of aspiration, destruction, ambition, confidence and anxiety,"" said Klaus Mühlhahn, professor of Chinese history at the Free University of Berlin.
""I think a lot of Chinese policy is driven by fear,"" he said. ""This fear of losing power, of a development similar to what happened in the Soviet Union, shapes much of the policy and thinking."" 
That anxiety and fear are only increasing as the party faces new and significant challenges.
For starters, Xi is locked in a protracted trade war with the United States that coincides with the most rapid cooling in economic growth in a generation. Premier Li Keqiang recently said it would be difficult for China, which enjoyed double-digit growth just over a decade ago, to maintain 6 percent growth. 
But Tao Wenzhao, a political analyst at the state-affiliated Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that the trade war would not influence the celebration.
""If there was no trade war, we would still be celebrating,"" he said. ""Competition has become the new normal. We see it in every area.""
Another problem: Hong Kong. The protests there against the mainland's efforts to exert control over the former British colony are set to come to a head on Tuesday, with a huge counter-rally planned to coincide with the parade. As the anniversary nears, the party is doing its best to make sure the 1.4 billion people of China feel proud and remain loyal.
""Over the past 70 years, China's success boils down to the Communist Party's leadership,"" it said in a 49-page white paper published Friday hailing the achievements of the past seven decades, and particularly of the past seven years, since Xi took the reins.
""The Chinese nation has risen and become prosperous, and is becoming strong, closer to the goal of national rejuvenation than ever before,"" it said. ""China's development path will look on brighter and brighter prospects as time moves on.""

Calling all freedom-loving nations,"Regarding John Pomfret's June 18 Tuesday Opinion essay, ""What the unrest in Hong Kong means for the future of Taiwan,"" and the editorial ""Hong Kong's pushback"" the same day:
The massive protest of the controversial extradition bill in Hong Kong is a sobering reminder that democracy should not be taken for granted. Beijing's ""one country, two systems"" model has proved to be only an illusion without credibility. Taiwan will never sacrifice its sovereignty, democracy and dignity to such a political trap.
Taiwan always treasures and safeguards universal values of human rights, freedom and civil liberties. The people of Taiwan support and stand closely with the people of Hong Kong as China has intensified its intimidation and coercion to undermine our hard-earned democratic way of life. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen urges the Hong Kong government to take the protest demands seriously, engage in dialogue and refrain from the use of force.
We call for all freedom-loving countries to stand together against Orwellian threats from any authoritarian regime and to jointly ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific.

"Hong Kong police, protesters insult each other with dehumanizing terms","HONG KONG - The riot police, dressed in green fatigues, advanced down a central city street. Some of the officers wore black masks, while others held shields or shotguns loaded with rubber bullets and tear-gas grenades.
As a few dozen protesters jeered, police fired back with their own insults. 
""Remember, you are not a person, you are not even worthy as an animal!"" an officer shouted. ""You are not a person, you're a cockroach!"" Soon, police unleashed tear gas at the crowd from close range - one of almost 400 canisters fired on Saturday. 
Derogatory language - with protesters terming officers dogs and gangsters, and police calling demonstrators subhuman and cockroaches - has become a hallmark of Hong Kong's protests as clashes have escalated. 

Police put up a massive show of force this past weekend- even against peaceful protesters - as authorities grow more determined to end the months-long unrest. Between Friday and Sunday, more than 300 people were arrested, according to police. On Sunday, a man armed with a knife attacked pro-democracy demonstrators and left three in critical condition, including one who had part of his ear bitten off.
In this deteriorating climate, the dehumanizing language employed by police is especially troubling, experts say, as it can be a precursor to more indiscriminate violence toward civilians. 
The use of ""cockroach"" - a slur used by the Nazis against Jews and by Hutus against Tutsis in the Rwandan genocide - often provides the rationale for harsh and cruel treatment against a group of people and serves to further polarize society, these experts say, especially when used by state actors.

""There is the notion of an infestation, that there's something here you need to snuff out before it takes over,"" said Allison Skinner, an assistant professor of behavioral science and social psychology at the University of Georgia.
In July, the Junior Police Officers' Association, a union that represents many front-line officers, started referring to protesters in its official statements as cockroaches. In an Aug. 4 statement, the association wrote: ""Even though the rioters don't like being called 'cockroaches,' how you're acting is indeed like cockroaches. Cockroaches, please stop.""
""This sort of derogatory language can lead to a deeper kind of genuine dehumanization,"" said David Livingstone Smith, a professor of philosophy at the University of New England who has written books on dehumanization and violence. ""You call people cockroaches a lot, you start thinking that they are subhuman."" 

Such language, he added, must be viewed ""either as a symptom of an increasingly dangerous situation, or a promoter of one, or both."" 
Asked in August about the matter, Kelvin Kong, a senior superintendent with the police public relations branch, told reporters that such language from front-line officers was ""not ideal"" but added that all parties ""are under a lot of stress."" 
In an emailed response to questions from The Washington Post, the police public relations branch said the department is ""aware of such a term used by certain officers and are of the view that the language is not appropriate.""
""Officers have been reminded to always present themselves professionally and to use respectful language to address members of the public,"" the response added. ""However, officers' interaction with members of the public is based upon mutual respect. It is understandable that given the vulgar verbal abuse from certain radicals targeting the police, officers may have ups and downs in their emotions.""
Trust in Hong Kong's police force, once deemed ""Asia's Finest,"" has collapsed in recent months. In polling conducted last month by the Center for Communication and Public Opinion Survey at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, 51.5 percent of respondents said they had zero trust in the police force, compared with 6.5 percent in May and June. 
On Sunday, a 24-year-old who gave only one name, Lau, for fear of repercussions, attended an unsanctioned rally in Victoria Park with her aunt and friend. They left before police stormed in. The three were stopped by officers as they were exiting, she said, and told to walk in another direction. 
The trio tried to explain that they lived only one block away, in the direction they were headed, but officers searched their bags. 
As the search was finishing, Lau said, an older male officer told them: ""Okay, let me give you some advice. Go back up [to your home], stop being cockroaches, and just become humans again.""
Lau was stunned. ""I've heard them say it on TV, and I've heard people describe how they were called cockroaches, but I guess it was like getting the wind knocked out of you,"" she said. ""I felt cold because he said it so matter-of-factly."" 
As concerns have grown that the police are operating with impunity, even moderate politicians and pro-Beijing lawmakers have urged the city's leader, Carrie Lam, to open a fully independent investigation into the force, which is one of the protesters' demands. She has refused. 
The language from the police underscores the lack of accountability under Hong Kong's undemocratic system, said William Donohue, a professor of communication at Michigan State University.
""If the state actor comes from a democratically elected system, you typically don't get this kind of language [as] there is the assumption that the government is accountable to the people,"" Donohue said. 
""But when you have a government that is not elected, when it rules by other means, they feel less restricted, they are not accountable to anybody.""

Hong Kong's system was bound to fail,"Freedom and autocracy couldn't coexist forever, says journalist Keith B. Richburg

'One country, two systems."" Those four simple words sounded like a good idea 40 years ago, when China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, was meeting with visiting British dignitaries in Beijing, trying to chart a future for their last major colonial outpost in East Asia. Hong Kong's lease was set to expire in two decades' time, and Deng was attempting to bridge an impossible divide. His proposal would allow China to take ownership of the territory and erase a century and a half of humiliation, while leaving Hong Kong's open, liberal free-market system intact under a ""high degree of autonomy."" If the nebulous formula worked, it might pave the way to solving other similarly intractable divides - in Northern Ireland, the two Koreas, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and eventually even China and Taiwan.
In hindsight, this untested idea was always doomed to fail.
Never before had an autocratic, communist-run, single-party dictatorship peacefully absorbed a modern, sophisticated, quasi-democratic capitalist territory. Never before had a people who had enjoyed free speech, freedom of assembly, a free flow of information and limited free voting voluntarily relinquished those rights to merge with a country where such freedoms were often ruthlessly suppressed.
The increasingly violent confrontations between police and protesters that have rocked Hong Kong since June 9 are an inevitable result of the inherent and unresolved contradictions in that ""one country, two systems"" concept. Key details of how the formula would work were left deliberately vague and up to future interpretation. Its success depended not on any ironclad enforcement mechanisms but on the faith and goodwill of the key party implementing it, China. The idea that Britain or even the United States could retain some residual sway over Hong Kong's fate was always a matter of hope, not reality.
And the formula's success rested entirely on a willing suspension of disbelief - that China's control-oriented communist rulers would allow Hong Kong to maintain the status quo undisturbed for 50 years after the British handover in 1997. The ""one country, two systems"" blueprint became a kind of global Rorschach test, with everyone seeing precisely what they wanted to see. People in the territory heard, Our lives won't change much. Beijing heard, They will submit.
China wanted Hong Kong's economic prosperity but not its politics, and after 1997, the government considered all Hong Kong matters an ""internal affair."" According to the Chinese view, they were reabsorbing a region that had been improperly seized in an earlier era. Hong Kong's leftist pro-China faction saw the reunification as the achievement of its patriotic dream. The pan-democratic camp believed that it would have five decades of autonomy, during which time it could unlock universal suffrage. The British believed they had orchestrated an agreement that would allow a dignified handover with protections for their former colonists and a continuing role for themselves in monitoring things. The 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration that laid the groundwork for the handover was an international treaty with binding effect - even though there was no specific enforcement mechanism in case of violations.
These contradictions were on full display in the speeches before and during the ornate handover ceremony in 1997. President Jiang Zemin welcomed Hong Kong's 6.4 million people ""to the embrace of the motherland."" He promised that the territory ""shall gradually develop a democratic system that suits Hong Kong's reality,"" without elaborating. Prince Charles, who attended the ceremony inside the new waterfront convention center, intoned: ""The solemn pledges … in the 1984 Joint Declaration guarantee the continuity of Hong Kong's way of life. For its part the United Kingdom will maintain its unwavering support for the Joint Declaration."" Tung Chee-hwa, the Shanghai-born shipping tycoon who became Hong Kong's first chief executive, replacing the colonial government, referred to the untried experiment and promised, ""We will make it work.""

But it wasn't long after the pomp and fireworks before Beijing began aggressively exercising its new sovereignty - and before Hong Kong's people began pushing back to protect their freedoms the only way they could, by taking to the streets in huge numbers. First, at Beijing's behest, Tung tried to push through a draconian national security law in 2003 that would have given the police broad powers for warrantless searches and arrests in cases involving treason and sedition. Many in Hong Kong feared that it would be used to stifle political dissent and criminalize free speech. More than half a million people filled the streets in protest. The bill was withdrawn, and Tung ignominiously resigned midway through his second term, citing health reasons. (He was given a face-saving sinecure in a Beijing advisory body.)

Students and parents took to the streets in 2012, when the local government tried to introduce Chinese ""patriotic"" education into Hong Kong schools. The proposed curriculum whitewashed controversies like the Cultural Revolution and the Tiananmen Square massacre, while extolling the virtues of the Chinese Communist Party as ""progressive, selfless and united."" In the wake of a massive public outcry, the plan was withdrawn and another chief executive, C.Y. Leung, was hobbled.
Young protesters again blockaded streets and government buildings in what became known as the ""Occupy Movement"" of 2014. They demanded political reforms and the right to elect their chief executive. Police eventually cleared out the protesters, who had dwindled to a rump core after 79 days, and Leung, discredited, dropped his bid for reelection to a second term as chief executive.
The proximate cause of the latest uproar was the effort by Leung's successor, Carrie Lam, to ram through a new extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects arrested in Hong Kong to be shipped across the border for trial in mainland China. Lam has tried to claim that the bill was just closing ""a loophole."" But she is being disingenuous. There's a reason Hong Kong has extradition agreements with some 20 other countries and not China: The mainland's judicial system is a legal black hole, where the Communist Party controls the courts, torture and false confessions are rife, prosecutors have a 99 percent conviction rate, and prisoners are often denied medical treatment.

Hong Kong now appears to have reached a crossroads. China under Xi Jinping seems less interested in preserving ""two systems"" and more interested in aggressively asserting control over its wayward territory. The protesters seem to know they have no other way to stop Hong Kong from becoming, in their view, ""just another mainland Chinese city."" The unstoppable momentum of the protest movement is crashing headlong into the immovable object of the Communist Party.
However the current confrontation ends - crushed by heightened police repression and eroding public support, or with intervention from mainland security forces - the ""one country, two systems"" formula now seems dead. It will certainly never be accepted by Taiwan as a blueprint for reuniting with mainland China. The concept was ill-conceived, unrealistic and never fully fleshed-out. It was a fool's errand from the beginning.

"Chinese, U.S. negotiators meet amid hopes for a partial trade accord","U.S. and Chinese negotiators met Thursday amid rising hopes for a partial trade deal that would mark the first step back from a worsening dispute, but would leave the thorniest issues for future talks continuing deep into a presidential election year.
Robert E. Lighthizer, the president's trade chief, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin led the U.S. delegation that met a team from Beijing headed by Chinese Vice Premier Liu He. The high-powered Chinese squad, including the country's central bank chief and a hard-line commerce minister, brought a proposal for an ""early harvest"" accord, according to people familiar with the talks.
At the White House, President Trump gave reporters an upbeat assessment at day's end. He said the talks were ""going really, really well,"" adding: ""They're basically wrapping it up.""
The Chinese package includes a large increase in annual purchases of U.S. farm products, improved terms for access to China's market for autos and financial services, and tougher enforcement of certain intellectual property safeguards, said Myron Brilliant, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Beijing has dropped its insistence that any deal be conditioned on the elimination of all tariffs that Trump has imposed since the trade war began last year. Instead, the Chinese are asking that increases planned for Oct. 15 and Dec. 15 - which would affect scores of popular consumer products - be canceled and that the United States roll back a recent tariff hike that took effect Sept. 1.
The two sides also may spotlight a currency agreement that was first made public several months ago, which would rule out manipulating the yuan's value to gain a trade advantage, the people said.
Business leaders are urging the two sides to accept the multipart trade package as a down payment on a comprehensive accord. ""We've got to have progress,"" said Brilliant. ""The window for moving these trade talks forward is closing.""
Trump has repeatedly scoffed at the notion of settling for a limited accord, insisting that profound changes are required in China's state-directed economic model to create a more reciprocal trade relationship. ""I'm not looking for a partial deal. We're looking for the big deal,"" he said last month.
But the president is under pressure from his supporters, especially in the industrial Midwest and farm belt, to show signs of progress in a commercial standoff that has lasted for more than a year. A key manufacturing index last week fell to its lowest mark in a decade, business investment has turned negative and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has called for bringing the talks to a conclusion ""soon"" to ease rural America's pain.
""There's a lot of pain on both sides,"" said Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. ""Both sides are under stress.""
Trump also has adopted the two-step approach to trade talks with other negotiating partners. Last month, he announced a partial agreement with Japan that is expected soon to lead to talks on a more complete deal.
Earlier Thursday, the president raised hopes of a temporary China settlement with a tweet confirming that he had invited Liu to the White House on Friday after the talks conclude. ""Big day of negotiations with China. They want to make a deal, but do I? I meet with the Vice Premier tomorrow at The White House,"" the president tweeted.
If enough progress is made this week, Trump could seal an agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping at an Asia-Pacific leaders' summit in Chile next month.
Still, the package under discussion may not satisfy administration officials who are determined to force China to curb its lavish subsidies for its state-owned enterprises and to abandon its practice of stealing American trade secrets or forcing foreign companies to transfer technology to Chinese partners. Some Trump allies are skeptical that Beijing will keep any promises offered now or will follow through on broader changes in future talks.
""It sounds like the same thing they were offering in 2017,"" said one Trump supporter, who requested anonymity to speak freely.
The negotiations also are complicated by a host of non-trade issues that have arisen, including the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and U.S. sanctions on Chinese companies implicated in human rights abuses in China's Muslim-majority Xinjiang province. The administration also is mulling a range of proposals to limit financial ties between the two countries.
One idea under consideration is to blacklist Chinese firms that repeatedly steal U.S. intellectual property, according to two people familiar with the plan who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Placing more Chinese companies on the Commerce Department's ""entity list"" effectively blocks them from doing business in the United States unless they obtain a special license.
The recent flurry in the White House to come up with enforcement ideas beyond tariffs is a revival of the process that started early in the Trump administration to have both a ""tariff track"" and an investment restriction track, according to Timothy Fitzgerald, an associate professor at Texas Tech University and former member of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers.
The National Basketball Association found itself at the center of the tensions after the general manager of the Houston Rockets tweeted in support of the Hong Kong protests over the weekend. The NBA later put out a statement saying it recognized that the tweet ""offended so many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.""
But the statement sparked a backlash, prompting Commissioner Adam Silver to say the NBA would ""not put itself in position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say."" Meanwhile, China suspended TV broadcasts of NBA games, and many Chinese companies cut advertising relationships with the league.Anna Fifield in Beijing and Heather Long in Washington contributed to this report."
There's lots to do in Florida beyond theme parks,"On Mondays at 2 p.m., the Travel section staff hosts Talk About Travel, an online forum for reader questions and comments. The following is an edited excerpt from a recent discussion.
Q: As a Christmas gift this year, my brother and I are putting together a trip for my 81-year-old (but still quite physically active) father in Florida. It would be for about five days and would include a spring training baseball game as well as a day at the Walt Disney World Resort. I'm looking for interesting, off -the-beaten-path attractions and activities that are not theme-park-related, within an hour or two of Orlando. Any suggestions?

A: You should consider checking out the Kennedy Space Center while you're in town. They've added a lot of exhibits, and there's a sense of excitement with SpaceX and other private companies now on the complex. I'm also a fan of nearby Cocoa Beach and the Space Coast. It might make a nice day trip.
- Chris Elliott

Q: I have the opportunity to go to Hong Kong, and a couple of other cities in China. Is it safe? We have to fly in and out of the Hong Kong airport.

A: The State Department issued a travel advisory on Oct. 7, warning of ongoing protests and unrest. Of course, you could visit the city and be fine, as long as you avoid crossing paths with the police and protesters. But you could also stumble into an area of conflict and have to seek safety. It's a personal choice. I would go, but many people would hold off until the protests are over and they could more freely explore an amazing destination. - Andrea Sachs

Q: I live in the District and often travel to New York for Thanksgiving. Each year I stress about how to get there. I love the train, but it adds up. What are your thoughts about weather during that time of year? Should I be okay on the bus?

A: I'm always agonizing over the best way to get to New York, as my family also lives there, so I need to go fairly frequently. No method is perfect. In your case, I wouldn't worry about weather - I'd worry about traffic. The roads between here and New York are jammed over that weekend, and a journey that should take five hours can easily morph into an eight-hour nightmare. I'd cut costs elsewhere and take the train.
- Carol Sotilli

Q: If you have Global Entry, is Clear worth the additional cost? How much does it really speed up your processing?

A: Clear is available in more than 60 airports, stadiums and other venues around the country. With Clear, you might hop a few places ahead of passengers in the PreCheck line, but you still have to go through the same screening lane. For Clear's cost of $179 a year, I would just stick with Global Entry and PreCheck (at $100 and $85, respectively,
for five years). - C.E.

Q: My wife and I are looking at a ""double"" - Grand Tetons and Yellowstone - in 2020. Is mid- to late May too early, and does it make any difference which one is first? We won't be doing much hiking, and are thinking of flying to Denver and driving from there.

A: Not sure how long the trip will be, but that's a lot of driving. It would take something like 19 hours round trip to drive that route. I'd also look into flying to Jackson Hole Airport, unless time is no problem. May is early, and some hotels in Yellowstone, for example, don't even open until the later part of the month. I'd go as late as possible in May or maybe even early June. - C.S.

Q: I've been wanting to travel alone lately and have been thinking about doing a day or weekend trip or two from the District to ease myself into it. Any suggestions for destinations?

A: I just did a lovely day trip to Harpers Ferry, W.Va. Drove there on country roads, hiked several trails, visited the national historical park, had lunch in one of the town's neat little restaurants with a view and stopped at a winery on the way home. You can even take the train from Union Station, but you'll need to stay overnight. - C.S."
What could rise from the Brexit chaos,"Amid the storms of autocratic populism, democratic victories are especially precious. In Turkey, the new mayor of Istanbul represents a hopeful challenge to the 16-year rule of the country's strongman, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In Hong Kong, the student protesters have forced the withdrawal of a hated extradition bill. And in Britain this week, Parliament is standing up to a cynical prime minister bent on a destructive policy backed by the slimmest of possible mandates.
Three years ago, Britons voted by a narrow margin of 52 percent to 48 percent to leave the European Union. They were assured that the manner of the leaving would be smooth and even profitable. The Europeans would be desperate for a new trade relationship with Britain, because German carmakers love to sell into the British market. Quitting the E.U. would liberate money for the National Health Service and other public programs. There would be no serious fallout for the British economy or for England's relationship with Ireland or Scotland.
Three years on, these promises have been exposed as lies. A fractious negotiation with the E.U. yielded a withdrawal agreement so unappealing that it could not get through Parliament; the work of crafting a new trading relationship to replace E.U. membership has not even started. Rather than saving British taxpayers money, the withdrawal agreement lays down that Britain must pay a hefty exit fee of almost $50 billion to Europe. The British economy, which used to be one of the best performers in the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, has slumped toward the bottom of the league table. Peace in Ireland is at stake, and the Scots are again talking independence. Although opinion has shifted less than you might expect in the face of this evidence, a second referendum would probably overturn the vote to leave the E.U.
Before the referendum, the current prime minister, Boris Johnson, seemed unsure which side he favored. As mayor of London, he had privately dismissed the idea of quitting Europe, recognizing the damage it would do to the city's exports of financial services. In the run-up to the referendum, he drafted an unpublished newspaper column warning that Brexit would cause an economic shock, embolden enemies such as Russia's Vladimir Putin and perhaps even trigger the breakup of the United Kingdom. But, caring passionately and exclusively about his prime ministerial prospects, Johnson came out swinging in favor of Brexit.
Johnson was fired from his first job as a journalist for fabricating a quotation. He was fired from a later job for lying about adultery. During the referendum campaign, his campaign bus was plastered with a big fat lie about taxpayer savings from leaving the E.U. Now, having secured the prime ministership by winning a paltry 92,000 votes from members of his Conservative Party - a total representing about 0.2 percent of the British electorate - Johnson has descended to new depths of cynicism.
Contrary to Johnson's referendum promises, but consistent with his unpublished fears, the Brexit process is threatening peace in Ireland. The British economy shrank in the most recent quarter. But rather than soften his pro-Brexit position, Johnson is doubling down, promising to get Britain out of the E.U. by the end of October by dispensing with the need for a withdrawal agreement. The prime minister presents this folly as a way to get the Brexit process over with, much as a dentist might end your agony by yanking out your molar. But Johnson's latest promise is just another cynical lie. If Britain left the E.U. without a deal, it would immediately need to negotiate with Europe about customs arrangements, food safety rules, the treatment of expatriates and so forth. Europe is not a rotten tooth that can be extracted and forgotten.
Johnson is coupling a destructive objective with equally destructive tactics. A majority of voters oppose his no-deal exit plan, and a majority of elected lawmakers regard it as madness. So the prime minister resolved to silence opponents by suspending Parliament. Until a few days ago, this anti-democratic coup seemed set to work. But this week lawmakers are seizing the last days before their suspension to block a no-deal outcome. A series of defeats for the prime minister in parliamentary votes suggests he has lost control of the government.
One way or another, the chaos will probably result in an election. The outcome is deeply uncertain, because Johnson's main opponent, the anti-Semitic and anti-capitalist Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is no more appealing than he is. The one hope is that a new political center will rise out of the mayhem. It is not the sort of miracle that sober pundits would bet on. But nor did they predict Istanbul's new mayor. Or the student protests in Hong Kong.

How China wins,"It has all been so vague and furious and quick. First, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted and then deleted a post last weekend supporting the protests in Hong Kong. When Chinese sponsors fled, the Chinese Basketball Association suspended cooperation with the team and the Internet giant Tencent stopped streaming Rockets games, Morey and the team's owner expressed regret,
and droves of fans and politicians flayed the league for abasing itself. A few days later, National Basketball Association Commissioner Adam Silver issued a statement supporting free speech, and the scandal began to subside; the editor of the Global Times communist tabloid seemed to speak of Chinese sentiment when he said his paper ""will not push to keep it hot."" 
But the greatest act of villainous, hypocritical cowardice this past week didn't come from the NBA. At the height of the controversy, a senior news director at ESPN mandated that the network's coverage ""avoid any political discussions about China and Hong Kong,"" according to Deadspin's summary of a leaked memo - a shocking directive for the biggest political sports story of 2019. ESPN even broadcast a map that included Taiwan as part of China and a dotted line to represent China's disputed claims in the South China Sea. ""I've literally never seen that map outside of China,"" tweeted Julian Ku, an expert on Chinese law. It was the most telling illustration yet of a major problem in U.S.-China relations.
Criticism of China's unfair treatment of American companies has focused on technology transfers, state support of domestic businesses and intellectual-property theft. But Beijing doesn't just want foreign companies to advance its economic interests. It wants them to advance its political ones, too. In subtle and sophisticated ways, Beijing convinces, cajoles and cudgels American companies to promote the values of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, parrot the party's views and enshrine self-censorship about China in their corporate cultures. When it's successful, as with ESPN, the company advances Chinese propaganda. 
One way American companies protect the party's view is by suppressing negative information; Morey did this when he deleted his tweet. So did Activision Blizzard, an American entertainment company that required a professional video gamer to forfeit $10,000 in prize money for shouting, ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times"" in a post-match interview. Beijing does not want to weaken these companies or push them out of China. Instead, it wants them to follow the party's rules, both in China and globally. ""China doesn't just want you to comply with its wishes,"" a Singaporean diplomat told a newspaper last year. It wants you to ""do what it wants without being told."" Although Tencent owns 5 percent of Activision Blizzard and ESPN owner Disney has worked to mollify the party for decades, it seems unlikely that any Chinese source told officials how to act or which map to use. They had internalized Beijing's demands.
The other way U.S. companies promote China's views is by amplifying positive information. In January 2018, Marriott sent guests an online survey that listed Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet and Macao as countries, and a U.S.-based employee of the hotel chain liked a Twitter post about the nationhood of Tibet, a Chinese region where some citizens want independence. Beijing decided to make an example of Marriott - a company thriving in China, with more than 300 hotels there: It required Marriott to shut down all of its Chinese websites and apps for seven days. 
Sounding like a Chinese propaganda organ, the company announced that it didn't support ""separatist groups that subvert the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China."" Then, to amplify the positive, Marriott announced an ""eight-point rectification plan"" to ""regain confidence and trust."" 
Part of the plan, according to the Hong Kong Free Press, included ""expanding employee education globally"" - i.e., educating its staff on Chinese propaganda. A Versace statement this year was even more groveling. In August, after an outcry over a T-shirt that implied Hong Kong was independent, the luxury clothing brand affirmed that ""we love China and resolutely respect the sovereignty of its territory."" 
Chinese Chairman Xi Jinping calls this ""discourse power"" - the ability to shape the narrative and ""tell China's story well."" And foreign companies and their employees are excellent proxies for evangelizing China's position. In other words, while the United States excels in soft power, China wins in what we could call proxy power. When retired Chinese basketball star Yao Ming praises China, Americans expect it. When Houston Rockets star James Harden apologizes for his team and professes that ""we love China"" and ""everything there about them,"" that feels more heartfelt. Though Harden's sentiments may be sincere, his contrition advances Beijing's propaganda goals. 
Sometimes, when China punishes a foreign company for violating unstated rules, no one bothers to explain how to rectify the crime. The Chinese sportswear firm Anta, for example, simply canceled contract negotiations with the NBA because the league's words were ""wrong."" To restore their good standing, executives must supplicate, with minimal guidance from the party-state. ""The NBA has been in cooperation with China for many years,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a Tuesday news conference. ""It knows clearly in its heart what to say and what to do."" 
Other times, Beijing has specific demands. In July 2018, China required global airlines in all their communications to stop implying that Taiwan was independent from the mainland. A United Airlines flight, for instance, now departs from ""San Francisco, CA, US"" and lands simply in ""Taipei,"" orphaning Taiwan's capital. Now that no major international airlines refer to Taiwan as a country, it would be newsworthy if any of their employees, advertisements or affiliates said otherwise. It's much safer to self-censor than to risk a scandal that could cost revenue. One day in January 2018, China's Cyberspace Administration ordered the clothing retailer Zara and the world's largest medical device company, Medtronic, to post apologies by 6 p.m. that evening for labeling Taiwan as a separate country on their websites. It also demanded that the companies ""conduct a comprehensive self-examination"" to make sure there were no violations elsewhere on their sites. Both companies complied. 
It's not a new phenomenon. ""If you want to deal in China, you will sing their tune,"" James Lilley, American ambassador to China from 1989 to 1991, told the journalist John Judis in 1997. What has changed since Xi assumed power in 2012, and especially over the past few years, is that Beijing now has the confidence and the market heft to threaten convincingly. Its ultimatums terrify executives. China's gross domestic product surpassed $13 trillion in 2018 - a more-than-tenfold increase over 2000. Moreover, because self-abasement in China can carry reputational costs in the United States, corporations increasingly speak with a pro-Beijing message, so they don't have to look like they're caving when the party calls them out. No company wants a pummeling like the NBA is currently receiving from American politicians, columnists and fans. 
Beijing doesn't force these companies to self-censor because it cannot tolerate dissent or because the party is so brittle that criticism would destroy it. Rather, it does so because it can. This is an effective public relations strategy, honed over decades, that co-opts some foreigners into facilitating the spread of Chinese propaganda. While there are risks of overplaying - a prolonged NBA scandal, for example, could cause Chinese fans to direct their anger not only at the league but at Beijing - it has succeeded in creating a coterie of Western chief executives petrified of offending Beijing.

Will the NBA be one of the rare exceptions? In his statement, Silver said, ""The NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues."" But just two days later, a Houston Rockets executive blocked a CNN reporter from asking about the China scandal. ""We're taking basketball questions only,"" she said. That is discourse power.

Hong Kong speaks out,"IN 2003, a proposed anti-subversion law that threatened civil liberties brought hundreds of thousands of protesters to the streets of Hong Kong, which prizes the rule of law and freedom of expression it has retained since returning to Chinese rule in 1997. Authorities backed down. But that was in another era, before the rise to power in Beijing of Xi Jinping, who aspires to construct a 21st-century model of rigid authoritarianism.
On Sunday, Hong Kong saw what appears to have been the biggest demonstration since 2003: Up to 1 million people were reported to have choked the streets to protest a bill that would allow extraditions from Hong Kong to mainland China. The measure could, and probably would, be used to silence critics of Communist Party rule, and it would undermine a legal system whose impartiality has been one of the foundations of the city's economic success.
Yet even many of those who joined the protest acknowledged they did not expect to succeed in stopping the measure. Hong Kong's authorities are no longer responsive to public opinion, even when massively expressed. They cater only to Mr. Xi. ""We are still doing it,"" the territory's chief executive, Carrie Lam, confirmed on Monday.
Ms. Lam began promoting the extradition measure in March, using as her pretext the case of a Hong Kong man who is accused of murdering a woman in Taiwan, with which Hong Kong does not have an extradition agreement. The law would allow suspects to be transferred on a case-by-case basis to jurisdictions including both Taiwan and the mainland. But Taiwan has already said it will not employ the law, because it treats the island as a part of China.

A much more plausible use would be to transfer Beijing's opponents, such as the men associated with a Hong Kong-based book publisher who were abducted there and in other countries in 2015 after they marketed gossipy tomes about Chinese leaders. Beijing was heavily criticized for the crude operation and for the subsequent seizure of a businessman who disappeared from a luxury hotel two years ago.

 The new law would provide a legal veneer for such kidnappings; though political and business crimes are nominally excluded from the law, communist authorities are adept at concocting criminal charges. One of the men abducted in the book publisher case, Gui Minhai, was first reported to have been charged for a traffic fatality. He continues to be lawlessly imprisoned in China.

The massive crowd in downtown Hong Kong Sunday showed that the city's residents understand very well what is at stake. Once the law is in effect, politicians, journalists and civil society activists who speak about the city's steadily eroding autonomy and Mr. Xi's consolidation of dictatorship will be under perpetual threat. As Jimmy Lai, a local media magnate, put it, ""Hong Kong will just become another Chinese city ruled by the Communist Party.""

That, of course, would be a betrayal of China's commitment to preserve Hong Kong's separate economic and political systems until 2047. Yet as Mr. Xi has demonstrated again and again, treaties and international law won't restrain his ambitions. Nor, alas, will the wishes of the Chinese people."
Firms see China's slap at NBA as warning,"It's not just professional basketball drawing China's wrath.
As China criticized the National Basketball Association this week for a pro-Hong Kong message delivered by one of its team leaders, other American companies scrambled to avoid fallout of their own.
Tiffany & Co., which relies on the Chinese market for double-digit revenue growth, scrapped a global advertising image that some in China perceived as supporting Hong Kong protesters, even though the company said the image was taken weeks before the demonstrations began.
Blizzard Entertainment, the Irvine, Calif.-based video-game giant, suspended a professional player for one year for reportedly shouting ""Liberate Hong Kong!"" during an interview.
China has long been sensitive about its image at home, controlling what it allows Western businesses and its own citizens to say or do there. Now, however, with Hong Kong in its fourth month of street protests, China is increasingly imposing the same strictures on what's said about it beyond its borders.
""This is core to Xi Jinping's narrative about recapturing China's greatness,"" said Elizabeth Economy, director for Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, referring to the Chinese president.
""Whenever they see evidence that the international community is supporting Hong Kong or Taiwan as independent entities, they try to find ways to bring dissenting voices in line,"" she said. ""They don't tolerate dissent on this topic inside China, and increasingly they are not tolerating dissent on these issues outside China.""
The tension underscores how reliant vast sectors of the U.S. economy are on China, not just on the nation's consumers, but also on the blessing of Beijing's leaders. And it raises questions not just about how American companies will shape their products and services to cater to the Chinese market, but also about how flexible they will be on traditional American values of free speech and democracy.
From hospitality and Hollywood to technology, American companies have increasingly been bending to accommodate China in recent years.
""I think if you charted it out, there's been a dramatic increase in these incidents in the last five years. That's all about the Chinese Communist Party regime throwing its weight around and feeling it now has the leverage and confidence about using the power of its market to apply pressure,"" said Aaron Friedberg, a China expert at Princeton University who served as an adviser to former vice president Richard B. Cheney.
""They've done this in the past for other reasons, to extract technology from American companies,"" he said. ""Now they're using it for bigger, more visible political issues.""
Consumer companies with high visibility among American and Chinese citizens have faced particular wrath from China in the aftermath of perceived slights.
Tiffany's troubles stemmed from an ad showing a female model holding her hand over her right eye. Some in China saw it as a sympathetic reference to a Hong Kong protester who was shot in the eye in August.
The ad ran in print and online inside and outside China. Tiffany denied it had any relation to the Hong Kong protests, which began in June and intensified over the summer.
""This campaign image, which was photographed in May 2019, was in no way intended to be a political statement of any kind. We regret that it may be perceived as such, and in turn have removed the image from our digital and social media channels,"" the company said in an emailed statement.
On a website for its ""Hearthstone"" game, Blizzard on Tuesday said it had ejected a player nicknamed ""Blitzchung"" from a tournament for violating competition rules in a way that brought ""disrepute"" to the player, offended the public or damaged Blizzard's image. The company didn't respond to a request for further comment.
Other companies have gotten into trouble for perceived slights relating to Taiwan or Tibet. Last year, Marriott International apologized to the Chinese government after listing Taiwan, Tibet, Macao and Hong Kong - all territories China claims - as stand-alone countries on an email questionnaire it sent to members of its rewards program.
Mercedes-Benz issued an apology after offending Chinese consumers with an ad quoting the Dalai Lama. Outside China, the 82-year-old spiritual leader is among the world's most popular figures, known for his teachings on peace and compassion, as well as for supporting an autonomous Tibet. The Chinese Communist Party, however, considers him a political agitator.
The NBA's trouble began after Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey sparked a furious backlash Friday when he tweeted: ""Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.""
After his social media account was inundated with criticism, Morey deleted his tweet, and Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta unsuccessfully tried to distance his organization from the sentiment. As Chinese media partners and sponsors quickly cut ties with the Rockets, the NBA issued a statement Sunday expressing ""great respect for the history and culture of China"" but also defending Morey's rights to free expression. The NBA did not discipline Morey.
In response, CCTV, the Chinese state television network, canceled its broadcasts of preseason games in China this week, and Chinese retailers like Alibaba removed NBA merchandise from websites.
NBA Commissioner Adam Silver issued a statement Tuesday reaffirming his defense of Morey's freedom of expression, saying that the NBA ""could not operate"" if it attempted to regulate what players, employees and owners said on political issues. Silver also stressed the league's ""great affinity"" for China and told reporters that he would attempt to repair relations during his visit to China this week.
But China watchers said rapping the knuckles of a popular sports league ensures that a wide swath of Americans get the message. That's important to Beijing as it sees broad support for the Hong Kong protesters in the Western press and on social media, experts said.
China's influence has grown alongside its market potential for Western companies.
The NBA's global aspirations rely heavily on China, with Silver in June referring to the country and its population of 1.4 billion as an ""enormous opportunity."" The NBA began hosting exhibition games in China in 2004 and officially opened a China office in 2008. Although China will not broadcast the games, the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets will play this week in Shanghai and Shenzhen, continuing a long-standing tradition of sending high-profile teams to China during the preseason.
Meanwhile, superstars such as Kobe Bryant and LeBron James have regularly made pilgrimages to promote their sneakers. Numerous NBA players, including former Miami Heat star Dwyane Wade, have signed promotional deals with Chinese sneaker companies rather than American brands. And NBA teams including the Houston Rockets and Golden State Warriors have designed and worn jerseys aimed specifically at the Chinese audience.
According to league figures, 640 million Chinese viewers consumed NBA content during the 2017-2018 season, and the NBA's most recent five-year extension with Chinese online entertainment giant Tencent was reportedly worth $1.5 billion. Tencent announced that 21 million people used its service to watch the decisive game of the 2019 NBA Finals - topping the television viewership number in the United States.
Silver told reporters this week in Japan that the league had already felt ""fairly dramatic consequences"" from Morey's tweet. A Chinese boycott of the NBA would do significant damage to the league.
Some industries are increasingly anticipating Chinese sensitivities and working to avoid them.
To win China's coveted film distribution slots, Hollywood has tried to avoid content that authorities find morally or politically offensive. In some cases, this has extended to outright changes after a movie has been shot. The producers behind the reboot of ""Red Dawn"" earlier this decade altered the film in post-production so the villains were from North Korea instead of China.
In other instances, Hollywood has included references to Chinese genius, as in the disaster movie ""2012,"" in which Chinese scientists rescued civilization.
Marvel shot some of ""Iron Man 3"" in the country with the help of Chinese investment. New scenes were added specifically for the Chinese release. Hollywood studios often partly finance their films with Chinese investors, deepening the relationship.
China is the world's second-largest market by box office revenue, and Hollywood has often reaped the benefits. 
Studio movies took in more than $2 billion in the country last year. Officially, though, only some 38 Hollywood films are allowed to play in Chinese theaters, according to the rules of the government-run China Film Group. This causes a scramble among studios to please authorities.
The U.S.-China trade war has lent these efforts a fraught quality; many big-budget films have been unable to secure slots since the conflict intensified. 
Disney remains the exception. The company - which has partnered with the Shanghai government on a theme park there - is still seeing many of its offerings available in the country.
For now, much of Hollywood seems content to keep its head down and steer clear of the controversy that has gripped the NBA - so much so that John Penotti, the Los Angeles-based producer of ""Crazy Rich Asians,"" who conducts business throughout Asia, said entertainment officials on both sides of the Pacific are avoiding the subject of the Morey backlash.
""I haven't heard a single person bring it up in conversation in the past few days,"" he said. ""It's kind of amazing.""

Rubio seeks TikTok probe over Chinese censorship concerns,"Sen. Marco Rubio on Wednesday asked the U.S. government to open an investigation into TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned social media app, out of concern that the company is ""censoring content"" around the world to satisfy Beijing's leaders.
Rubio (R-Fla.) requested a broad investigation into the company from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, which oversees foreign acquisitions for national security concerns. In 2017, TikTok's parent company, Bytedance, purchased Musical.ly, which had a presence and user base in the United States, and later merged it with its own offering, creating the social media behemoth that has been installed by more than 1 billion people globally.
In his letter Wednesday to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Rubio requested a full review of the national security implications of ByteDance's acquisition. ""The Chinese government's nefarious efforts to censor information inside free societies around the world cannot be accepted and pose serious long-term challenges to the U.S. and our allies,"" he wrote.
In a series of tweets, Rubio added that he has asked the Trump administration to ""fully enforce anti-boycott laws"" that prohibit any person or ""U.S. subsidiaries of Chinese companies"" from ""complying with foreign boycotts seeking to coerce U.S. companies to conform with #China's government views.""
Rubio's call follows a firestorm of recent criticism aimed at both Chinese censors and U.S. companies that have penalized people for voicing support for protests in Hong Kong, in hope of avoiding the wrath of the government of the world's second-largest economy. China sanctioned the National Basketball Association this week after a team leader posted a message supporting the protests, and the California-based video-game giant Blizzard Entertainment suspended a professional esports player for shouting ""Liberate Hong Kong"" during an interview.
TikTok's lack of content related to the Hong Kong protests, which Chinese leaders have pushed to undermine, has raised fears that the platform is censoring ideas the government wants to suppress. In response, TikTok's Beijing-based parent company told The Washington Post last month that the app's U.S. platform was not influenced by the Chinese government, and that the lack of protest footage could be related to users' view of the app as a place for entertainment, not politics. It declined to share any additional details about its content-moderation practices.
A spokesperson for TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. The Treasury Department also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Rubio's quest for a CFIUS probe could resonate with the White House in the midst of its trade war with China, which has started to strain both countries' economies. Last month, the Trump administration proposed new rules that would enhance the powers of CFIUS, particularly with an eye on scrutinizing Chinese investment in areas including technology.Some business and technology analysts share Rubio's concerns, worrying that an encroachment of Chinese government control could threaten traditionally Western values supporting creative expression and freedom of speech. Technology analyst Ben Thompson said Tuesday that CFIUS should revisit TikTok's merger with Musical.ly and that ""the current skepticism around all Chinese investment in the United States should be continued if not increased.""
""Attempts by China to leverage market access into self-censorship by U.S. companies should also be treated as trade violations that are subject to retaliation,"" he wrote in his blog Stratechery. ""Make no mistake, what happened to the NBA this weekend is nothing new: similar pressure has befallen multiple U.S. companies, often about content that is outside of China's borders.""

NBA's correct China response is better late than never,"In simple comparison to other major American sports leagues, the NBA has acquired a reputation for progressivism that, while accurate, shouldn't be taken too far out of its context. A progressive sports league? It is quite oxymoronic when you think about it. The NFL may make the NBA seem like a paragon of social responsibility, but in general, it is the jumbo shrimp of forward-thinking.
That is not meant to minimize the laudable efforts the NBA has made to promote diversity, empower its employees to speak freely, champion gender equity and support gay rights. But it is a business above all, a multibillion-dollar powerhouse. While it has a heart and listens to its conscience, it is no less concerned with the bottom line than its peers. You cannot praise it as America's most progressive sports league without acknowledging that is a tricky thing to be known for and a difficult reputation to uphold.
You have seen why over the past few days as the league has stepped in the manure of a geopolitical controversy in China, struggled to determine the proper way to handle it, endured criticism for perceived hypocrisy and ultimately returned to its moral principles. In less than a week, the NBA has been stunned, soft, clumsy and redemptive in addressing a tweet sent by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey that supported pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.

After the league initially expressed regret about Morey's actions and left the impression of an apology, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has clarified the league's position and refused to back down amid increased pressure from the Chinese government and businesses to make an example of Morey.

""It is inevitable that people around the world - including from America and China - will have different viewpoints over different issues,"" Silver said in a statement Tuesday. ""It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences. However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.""
It took the NBA a few days to get on the right side of this controversy, partly because it's such a bizarre issue from an American perspective. We're free to run our mouths about anything, and this freedom of speech has been exercised to the fullest in recent years. But usually, we are discussing domestic conflicts. That approach doesn't translate well when the GM of the most popular NBA team in China makes reference to Chinese policies, challenging its communist beliefs and taking on perhaps its most sensitive issue in a short Twitter message.
Morey's tweet read: ""Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.""

From the American view, Hong Kong protesters are fighting for their human rights and to protect the integrity of a ""one country, two systems"" agreement with China. But the Chinese government labels it a ""separatist movement.""
Morey offended China so much that it wants to hurt the Rockets and the entire NBA as much as it can financially. The timing of this is particularly awful, with the NBA arriving in China for exhibition games, which Chinese broadcasters will no longer televise. Some businesses have pulled Rockets merchandise. The Chinese Basketball Association, led by Hall of Famer Yao Ming, is now at odds with the NBA; Silver characterized Yao as ""extremely hot"" over the dispute. Other companies are considering minimizing or abandoning their relationships with the NBA.
A harsh reaction was inevitable. So was the NBA's attempt at damage control to protect the hundreds of millions of dollars it receives from China's fascination with basketball. Such diplomacy angered some fans back home, with many questioning the moral worth of being so tied financially to China. If people were disappointed that the NBA was acting like any other business, well, that's exactly what it is.
It's rather naive to think a company selling a product will overextend itself, for no monetary reason, to solve some of the world's most challenging problems. That's why I cautioned celebration of the NBA as our most progressive sports league. That's why it is jumbo-shrimp praise. The NBA isn't in the business of progressivism. However, it does a commendable job of aligning a good portion of its interests with the passions of its workforce. 
Let's draw a quick comparison to athletes speaking out and protesting during the Black Lives Matter movement. Like the NFL, the NBA was adamant about players not making any demonstrations during the national anthem. In fact, the NBA has a clear and strong policy prohibiting such actions. Unlike the NFL, players didn't revolt because they knew they had something more important: the commissioner's ear and support.
Throughout his five years in charge, Silver has been a well-liked leader because he is a skilled diplomat. He is thoughtful. He listens. He values relationships. Nine times out of 10, he seems to do the right thing for the right reasons. His interpersonal approach means much to holding together a sprawling league undergoing a globalization. 
The more the NBA engages with the rest of the world, the more complicated NBA business will become. This is, by far, the most tenuous situation Silver has had to manage. And it won't be his last one. 
But he found the proper tone in reacting to China, which has taken its outrage to ludicrous levels. The NBA showed remorse; China wants Silver to punish Morey in a manner that scares the league's mouth shut. It's not going to happen.
""The fact that we have apologized to fans in China is not inconsistent with supporting someone's right to have a point of view,"" Silver said this week. 
In his statement, Silver elaborated: ""We recognize that our two countries have different political systems and beliefs. And like many global brands, we bring our business to places with different political systems around the world. But for those who question our motivation, this is about far more than growing our business.""
Morey's tweet will wind up costing the NBA tons of money. But when pressed like never before, Silver didn't budge on any of the NBA's core values. It's fair to criticize him for taking some time to get it right, but he has banked more than enough equity to be pardoned.

'This app is free and therapy is not',"Many Gen Z-ers are aware of privacy concerns on the Chinese-owned app TikTok. But they are in too deep to opt out.
The media executive had a dire message for Kayla Curry and her classmates: If you have TikTok on your phone, delete it.
The executive, who had come to talk to the journalism students at Missouri State University, was concerned about the app's Chinese owners and the potential that TikTok could be used to spread disinformation, according to Curry. Soon after that, the 19-year-old sophomore got a news alert from the New York Times reporting that TikTok was the subject of a national security investigation by the U.S. government.
Curry joined TikTok in September. She's a pretty typical user of the short video app: scrolling, sometimes for hours, watching an endless stream of videos that TikTok's mysterious algorithms guessed she would love. But as she read about the off-screen dimensions of the app, about who decides which videos get seen and which don't, she started to worry. And she processed that worry by making a TikTok video joking about it.
'Apparently TikTok is owned by a Chinese company that data-mines user information and sells it to the Chinese government,' Curry said, directly addressing the camera. 'Yikes.
'But honestly it's a small price to pay,' she continued, 'because this app is free and therapy is not.' Her video has more than 370,000 views.
TikTok referred The Washington Post's request for comment to an October statement on the company blog, which said that TikTok's data for U.S. users is stored in the United States, and that TikTok is 'not influenced by any foreign government, including the Chinese government.' Earlier this month, The Post reported that ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, subjected moderators to oversight and strict content rules as recently as last spring, according to multiple former employees. TikTok has said it has since changed the moderation process for U.S. content and is working on making the app more responsive to the expectations of American users.
TikTok's core audience is Gen Z, a generation that simultaneously balances a deep understanding of how the Internet has eroded privacy with the reality that living online is basically a requirement for young people who don't want to be hermits. Members of that generation are accustomed to the tension of projecting their lives to the world while coming to grips with the scrutiny and surveillance that follow.
Gen Z, after all, was responsible for the 'FBI Man' meme, which inspired touching vignettes of government agents who they assumed were monitoring all of their activity and devices. (For example: The FBI Man who has watched you for years through a hacked webcam sheds a tear as he watches you graduate from high school; the FBI Man who monitors your phone wonders when you will finally find love.)
The FBI Man meme was an early example of what happens when you still have to live under the watchful eye of faraway tech companies and their customers and collaborators. Living without a digital footprint is the only way to avoid compromising your privacy online, and Gen Z has more or less stopped 'trying to tip toe around it,' Curry told The Post in an email, 'because we know we can't avoid it.' 
'People our age are on all kinds of different social media platforms and we've heard countless stories about how our information is out there for everyone to see,' Curry wrote. She knows that signing up for an account on Google, for instance, grants the company access to a ton of information about her. She doesn't love that, 'but life without Google? Insane.' 
TikTok users can be surprisingly confessional, speaking to the camera as if they're Face Timing with a friend. Even if they know nothing on the app is really private, many young users treat TikTok as a space that exists outside the realm of parents and other authority figures. Confessional content also tends to do well on TikTok. The presence of corporate authorities is also treated as beside the point, with social media influencers on various platforms setting the tone.
'Creators are critical of host platforms and feel that they don't have their best interests at heart,' said Zoë Glatt, a researcher at the London School of Economics who studies content creators. 'However, creators still use these platforms, often to share intimate details of their lives, because they want to communicate with their audience-community (whether these are friends or fans).'
Internet users are hostages of their habits, regardless of generation, and so people who are outraged by the behavior of social media companies (and the behavior their platforms inspire in the rest of us) tend to register their disillusionment by contributing content to the very platforms they are criticizing. Facebook users post articles about Facebook's alleged deceptions of its users. In tweets, Twitter users admonish each other to 'never tweet.' 
On TikTok, users make videos that convey concern about the platform's security or criticize the Chinese government and dare TikTok's moderators to take it down. Some feature images of Winnie the Pooh "" whose resemblance to Chinese President Xi Jinping became a popular meme, prompting censorship of the cartoon bear in the country. Others discuss the protests in Hong Kong or, like Curry's video, concerns about data privacy. And although some of these videos do appear on the 'for you' feeds of American users, they're merely blips on the app's endless feed of family-friendly hashtag challenges, dance videos to the Home Depot theme song and jokes about boomers.
Some TikTok users are trying to actively test their own concerns about TikTok's Chinese ownership.
David, a 22-year-old TikTok user with about 60,000 followers who is part of a small group of individuals collecting information about censorship on the app, made two videos in recent weeks on China's alarming measures to forcibly assimilate the mostly Muslim Uighur minority, and potential censorship on TikTok, 'as an experiment to see what would get views, what would get response from viewers.' David asked that The Post withhold his last name because he was worried about how TikTok's moderators might respond to his videos.
His videos did well, but it's tough to turn concerns about the future of democracy into a catchy meme: Largely unanswered questions about the implications of a Chinese app attracting a huge audience of young Americans don't make for fun hashtag challenges. And, David worried, talking about those concerns can make you sound a bit conspiracy-minded.
Many TikTok users are aware of the app's Chinese ownership and the resulting complications, but it's more of a 'jokey awareness' from what they're seeing in a few short viral videos. American TikTok content on China is a lot of Winnie the Pooh and relatively little discussion of, for instance, how increasingly forceful crackdowns against pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong have turned a university campus filled with students similar in age to TikTok's core user base into the site of a siege. And that dovetails with the dominant tones of TikTok: confessional, playful and relatively wholesome.
'People are protesting in Hong Kong against the Communist Party and getting beaten and silenced,' Curry says, 'whereas in the U.S., we don't have to think twice about expressing our views.' 
TikTok is a space where forgetting about that reality is as easy as flipping to the next video.
'We're all just in too deep, I think,' the college sophomore says. 'And it's hard to break yourself from anything related to social media these days once you're hooked.'

Balenciaga re-envisions power dressing,"PARIS - The first model to make the rounds of the Yves Klein blue set was Neda Brady, an architect. With wavy white hair and angular features, Brady was dressed all in black - a comfortably fitting uniform of flat-front trousers, shirt and notched-collar jacket. A ""Balenciaga"" VIP tag on a lanyard hung around Brady's neck. This was the opening salvo in a treatise about power dressing. 
The Balenciaga spring 2020 collection was not just about business suits and executive sheaths. It was a monologue about the many forms power takes and the variety of people who wield it.
The guests at the runway show Sunday were seated in a single row in a ring that spiraled up five levels. The walls, the carpeting, the ceiling, the chairs - everything was bright blue. The tiered rings of seating recalled the chambers of the European Parliament, and it was as though the international audience were gathered for some stifling plenary session on the relationship between worker rights and the modern nation-state. 
Designer Demna Gvasalia cast his show with a diverse range of people. Some of them were experienced models, while others were taking on the role for the day but otherwise work as architects, engineers, financial analysts, musicians, artists, mothers - and students in the process of nurturing their own authority.
All of them wield a particular kind of power. They have the ability to shape our environment, to influence our culture, to move financial markets, to overturn governments, to teach us about unconditional love.
As the men and women made their way around the room, the music throbbed along with their footsteps, building to an ominous crescendo. Power, particularly as it is wielded by state actors, can be daunting and fearsome. And watching Gvasalia's power story unfold in this setting and in these times - with street protests in Hong Kong, an impeachment inquiry in Washington and climate change marches everywhere - made you shift uneasily in your seat. The struggles are real.
The uniform of bureaucrats was first on the runway. The suits. The men and women in black. They hold power because they enforce the rules. The VIP pass that turned into a Balenciaga accessory was a reminder that power comes with the ability to exclude. There is always another inner chamber, another rung to climb, another privilege to access. Power - and the lust for it - can be corrosive.
But it's also inspiring and reassuring to watch such a variety of men and women wind their way around the room with their own unique, determined stride. They didn't move with the precision of professional models - posture just so, one foot planted neatly in front of the other. Some of them lumbered, while others glided. One woman favored her left side. One man bobbed along like a show pony. Others raced past as though they needed to catch the last commuter train to the office.
They wore black. A lot of black. These everyday power brokers wore tailored trousers and jackets with exaggerated shoulders whose whalebone inner support could be removed for a more relaxed silhouette. Coats were pressed with irregular permanent pleats, and parkas enveloped the torso. There were tailored dresses as well as softly draping ones with seams that swirled around the body, in tabloid prints and perfume bottle ones. But there were also clothes for those who don't need a traditional power uniform. They can flex their power in running shirts and track pants.
Much of the collection is a continuation of the conversation Gvasalia began when he was appointed creative director of Balenciaga in 2015. He has always turned to the unconventional and the overlooked in telling his story of luxury and exclusivity. 
Part of that exploration has included experimenting with proportions and elevating the quotidian. But for spring 2020, Gvasalia has put these ideas into a different context. Instead of situating them in the realm of aesthetes and hipsters, he places them in the center of the mass consciousness. He inserts them into the workplace, the workday and the global conversation about what it means to be a worker in the 21st century.
The answer is that it can be rather dour. It can make one feel like an anonymous cog. We must be responsible for our own joy. And there's joy to be had. Long velvet dresses have giant removable crinolines. Silver and gold Lurex dresses are giddily ostentatious. And black dresses rimmed in lacy ruffles exude elegance.
No matter how one might feel about the aesthetics of Gvasalia's vision of power, there's a certain reassurance in its consideration. The women move in their clothes with as much ease and confidence as the men do. Their autonomy isn't celebrated; it's simply presumed. Gvasalia's realism may at times be harsh, but it's also liberating.
Ninomiya
It's impossible not to consider the environment and climate change when looking at Kei Ninomiya's spring 2020 Noir collection, presented Saturday afternoon. He called it ""Beginning,"" and it focused on the energy that comes from starting something new. So there were ferns and succulents sprouting from the magnificent plant crowns and headpieces created for the occasion by Azuma Makoto, a Japanese flower artist. The models walked down the runway as if they were human topiaries, to the sounds of leaves brushing against their legs and rustling from their strides.
Sometimes the plants appeared to be covering black blazers and trousers, as if some business hack was overgrown by nature, the same way the ruins of a lost civilization are reclaimed by the environment. Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust.

Ninomiya sometimes covers the face with mossy masks, and it can be jarring. It's easy to understand why some might take offense at the notion of covering a woman's face and making her anonymous. Of silencing her. In the context of his presentation, his decision comes as a suggestion: Perhaps we should refrain from focusing so much on us, on our individual needs and desires, and consider ourselves as part of an interconnected environment. We are part of the biodiversity, and we are not immune to extinction. 
Ninomiya reminds his audience of the precariousness of nature in the jolting appearance of a woman in slick, lacquered black detritus. She is a shimmering junk heap out of which a few sprigs of life grow. She is our haunting future. Is that bit of green a sign of life springing forth? Or the last gasp of joy?
There is a choice, of course. We can choose to stand in the darkness or to move into the light. We can see our world as something beyond a suburban cul-de-sac or an urban mews. Or we can be small and petty. 
A single blade of grass doesn't last long. Ninomiya suggests that we can start over - or at least start the day with fresh thoughts, new ideas . . . hope.

New face on China's trade team has White House worried,"Debut of perceived hard-liner, stalled talks dent hopes for dealThe Trump administration is increasingly concerned about prospects for a trade deal with China, amid an unexpected reshuffling of the Chinese negotiating team and a lack of progress on core issues since the Group of 20 summit in Japan, according to U.S. officials and senior Republicans briefed on the discussions.
Commerce Minister Zhong Shan, regarded by some White House officials as a hard-liner, has assumed new prominence in the talks, participating in a Tuesday teleconference alongside Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, who has headed the Chinese trade team for more than a year.
Hopes for a deal also have been dented by China's failure to make large new purchases of U.S. farm products - despite President Trump's claim at the G-20 that Chinese President Xi Jinping had agreed to place such orders ""almost immediately"" - and the lack of any announced schedule for the next round of direct talks.
Zhong's emergence comes two months after the U.S.-China trade negotiations collapsed with the Trump administration accusing Beijing of having reneged on a preliminary agreement.
""This has to be seen as a loss of confidence in Liu He and the desire of the leadership to bring in someone more politically savvy,"" said Dennis Wilder, a former China analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency. ""I am sure his instructions are to get tougher with the U.S.""
In an effort to revive the stalled trade talks, Trump agreed at the G-20 summit to postpone new tariffs on $300 billion in imports from China and to allow Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications company that U.S. officials call a national security threat, to continue buying American computer chips.
Trump told his trade team before the Tuesday call to secure the new Chinese orders for soybeans and wheat he believed he had been promised in Osaka, Japan. But Zhong and Liu offered no specific commitments, leaving negotiations at a virtual standstill, according to a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly.
The administration also has yet to reach agreement with the Chinese government on dates for chief trade negotiator Robert E. Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to visit Beijing for the next round of direct talks, though U.S. officials said they remain optimistic such a meeting will happen.
Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said administration statements about how the president's shift on Huawei would be implemented have been ""confusing to American companies"" and reflected a broader lack of follow-through to the discussions in Osaka. ""All of the things they spoke of - none of them have happened,"" said Allen, who added that he worries about an erosion of trust between the United States and China.
U.S. officials and Trump allies have privately expressed concern this week that the Chinese are digging in and avoiding firm commitments. 
""Republicans in general are frustrated that the Chinese have been so uncooperative at this stage, and it's now clear this is going to be a slow process,"" said conservative economist Stephen Moore, an informal Trump adviser. ""They keep backpedaling, and the hard-liners in China play right into the hands of hard-liners in the U.S.""
As the faint glow of the most recent Trump-Xi meeting fades, negotiators are confronting the same to-do list that vexed them two months ago. Talks broke down in early May over U.S. demands that China commit to rewrite its laws to address
complaints over its theft of intellectual property and forced technology transfer policies.
The two sides also deadlocked over Beijing's demand that Trump remove all of the tariffs he imposed on $250 billion in Chinese goods last year.
""We're stuck at the same point we were before,"" said Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute and occasional administration adviser. ""We're not getting anywhere.""
Zhong, 63, rose to a cabinet-level post in Beijing in 2017 after running two state-owned companies and serving as vice governor of Zhejiang province when Xi was the top official there.
""Zhong is a hard-liner's hard-liner,"" said former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, who remains close to several Trump advisers. 
Zhong, who joined the Communist Party at age 18, is the second veteran trade official to be added to the Chinese team in recent weeks. In April, Yu Jianhua, one of China's most experienced trade negotiators and its ambassador to the United Nations Office in Geneva, returned to Beijing to bolster Liu's delegation.
Some China specialists said the Trump administration is overreacting to a minor personnel move.
James Green, a senior trade official until earlier this year at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, said Liu is in no danger of being upstaged by the commerce minister. Liu and Xi were childhood friends.
""Some folks in the White House, who may not have had the same deep level of experience in dealing with a wide range of Chinese interlocutors, may read too much into who's on a call,"" said Green, a senior adviser at McLarty Associates. ""All Chinese negotiators are on an incredibly short leash.""
Clete Willems of the law firm Akin Gump, who worked on trade talks in the White House until April, said Zhong's inclusion on the Chinese delegation could reflect internal Chinese bureaucratic politics.
Just as the U.S. team includes Lighthizer, who is intent on striking an ironclad accord, and Mnuchin, who is more sensitive to the effects of trade tensions on financial markets, Beijing has its own hawks and doves.
""If Xi wants a deal, he needs to have both sides bought in,"" said Willems.
Though China's Commerce Ministry is generally regarded as supportive of trade links, Zhong is likely to fight fiercely to protect the country's commercial interests, according to Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser on China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Chinese officials may be delaying any trade concessions until they see how Trump's G-20 change on Huawei's purchases from U.S. companies is implemented and how the administration reacts to continuing protests in Hong Kong, according to one Trump supporter who has been briefed by administration officials and spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly.
The president in May signed an executive order that
bars Huawei from supplying equipment for next-generation 5G communications networks in the United States, while the Commerce Department prohibited American companies from selling parts to the Chinese company without a government license, effectively blacklisting one of China's most prominent global corporations.
China may be prepared to wait Trump out because its economy, which slowed sharply last year, has stabilized thanks to government stimulus measures. The president's on-again, off-again tariff threats also have eroded the Chinese government's faith in his ability to stick with any deal.

""The reality is that this likely means no deal for the foreseeable future,"" said Kennedy. ""China is no longer interested in reaching a big deal with Trump.""

"D.C. rises to No. 7 in world's safest cities index, up from 23rd two years ago","Three decades after the District was dubbed the ""murder capital"" of the United States for its crime-ridden streets and soaring homicide rate, the city has earned a new distinction in a report released this month: one of the safest large cities in the world.

Joining the likes of Tokyo, Singapore and Amsterdam in the upper echelon of the international Safe Cities Index for the first time, Washington, D.C., was especially lauded for its digital security and disaster preparedness in the Economist Intelligence Unit's biennial report.
The District, at No. 7, was the only U.S. city to crack the top 10 - and one of two in North America, along with Toronto.
The index, which ranks 60 cities across six continents, determines a city's overall safety by examining 57 indicators, including digital security, access to quality health care, life expectancy, environmental safety, city infrastructure, disaster preparedness, transportation safety, crime, violence and ""threat of civil unrest.""
The 2019 report also emphasized climate change, as well as cities' ability to withstand environmental threats and intensifying natural disasters.
Tokyo was ranked the safest city in the world for the third time, with Singapore and Osaka filling out the top three.
Hong Kong, which has for months been rocked by political upheaval, protests and at times violent clashes with police, dropped from ninth in 2017 to 20th place this year.
The District was ranked 23rd in the 2017 report. Experts attributed its catapult to seventh place as partly influenced by a shift in how data researchers compiled the final list.
The city ranked in the top 10 in three of the index's most important factors: digital security, health and infrastructure. Kevin Donahue, the District's deputy mayor for public safety and justice, said the city has placed a priority on safety issues.
""Mayor Muriel Bowser has been laser-focused on creating a safer, stronger D.C. that ensures personal safety and community resilience, but also prioritizes our city's cyber and infrastructure security,"" he said in a statement. ""We are honored to be ranked in the top 10 cities.""
Washington came in 23rd for ""personal security,"" a metric that considers ""how at-risk citizens are from crime, violence, man-made threats and natural disasters,"" but Washington topped all other U.S. cities on the list - which included Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco - in part because of the city's intense disaster preparedness, the report said.
The report's authors weren't available to comment Friday. 
Violent crime in the District has been steadily declining over the years, although homicides are on the rise this year, up 13 percent from last year.
After the slaying this week of 27-year-old Margery Magill, who was stabbed while walking a dog in the Park View neighborhood of Northwest Washington, Metropolitan Police Chief Peter Newsham called the District ""a very, very safe city."" He said the attack on Magill outside an apartment building about 8:45 p.m. Tuesday was ""very rare.""
Improving a city's ""personal security"" ranking is difficult to do in the short term, the study's authors wrote. It ""involves some longer-term challenges, such as building and maintaining trust with city residents,"" the report said. ""This can take time but is essential.""
Researchers wrote that the District also benefited from a change in the metrics the index used this year. Rather than counting the number of reported traffic accidents, the 2019 index compared the number of road deaths. It also considered what the index refers to as ""resilience-related indicators,"" such as the amount of emergency services in the city, catastrophe insurance, disaster-informed development and risk monitoring.
""Washington, DC, does better . . . than in the past because our measures and methodology give a better understanding of its strengths and weaknesses,"" according to the report.
The global study examines cities because, according to United Nations data, 56 percent of the world's population lives in cities. By 2050, the U.N. says, the rate of urban-dwellers will rise to 68 percent.
""The success or failure of cities will define the quality of human life in the years ahead,"" the report said.

"While Silver tries to straddle a line on China, the NBA misses a golden opportunity","In 1968, the Mexican army opened fire on students protesting the authoritarian regime of President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz in Tlatelolco Plaza, the death toll never released. Ten days later, the 1968 Summer Games in Mexico City commenced. Like nothing happened.
While no deaths have been reported among Hong Kong protesters objecting to China's attempt to impose its authoritarian rule, police shot a protester at close range, and a reported 1,100 people have been injured in the four-month-long standoff. 
But the NBA maintained its preseason games in China scheduled to tip off Thursday. Like nothing happened.At least until it was discovered that Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey retweeted a slogan in support of those demonstrating in Hong Kong.
NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who last year counted a Chinese audience 2
1/2
times that of the U.S. population watch his league's games on TV, tablet or smartphone, issued an apology to any offended Chinese, such as Joseph Tsai, the billionaire co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and owner of the Brooklyn Nets. Tsai wrote on Facebook, ""The hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair."" 
Chinese sponsors of Morey's team pulled their advertisements. Chinese broadcasters said they wouldn't show Rockets games. The Chinese Basketball Association, headed by former Rockets star and Chinese legend Yao Ming, announced it was suspending its relationship with Ming's former team.
But no one, other than Morey, championed those in Hong Kong protesting for their self-determination. And Morey abruptly deleted his tweet. 
It was the latest reminder that the notion of sport as being fearless on the front lines of social change is more fallacy than reality. It doesn't so often challenge the status quo, no matter how scurrilous, as embrace it. It should be remembered that the original big sports in this country - horse racing, boxing and baseball - racially segregated themselves in accordance with Jim Crow laws rather than fight the apartheid system those laws inflicted. 
And when billions of dollars are involved, as with the case of the NBA and China, the blindness is even more complete.
""If the NBA had no business in China, I'm sure it would probably be saluting Daryl Morey as a human rights advocate,"" said Robert McChesney, a University of Illinois media scholar who critiques media's intersection with politics and, with a brief background as a sportswriter, wrote a brilliant Marxist analysis of sportswriting's history. ""I mean, here's a guy standing up on principle for basic civil liberties and decency, whatever you think of the issue.
""But the money is just so astronomical, you can buy someone for that sort of money, clearly.""
That is what China did. It purchased whatever soul the NBA had. It bought off a league many observers thought in recent years was some sort of paragon to progressivism despite evidence to the contrary, such as its owners' historical preference of supporting Republican presidential candidates over Democratic hopefuls. 
NBA onlookers from the left of the political gauge gave the league a pass for having a written rule requiring its players to stand for the national anthem while they criticized the NFL for considering to implement one. They overlooked that when WNBA players, who play under the NBA's auspices, protested against police lethality against unarmed black men, the league fined the women until public pressure persuaded it to rescind the penalties. Although longtime Clippers owner Donald Sterling was infamous as this country's biggest offender of fair housing laws, the supposedly enlightened didn't call for his ouster until he was discovered sharing bigoted beliefs with his mistress.
""It's easy to be progressive on civil rights issues when 80 percent of your players are African American,"" McChesney observed. ""Let's face it: If you're a white supremacist, you're probably not an NBA fan. So you're dealing with a fan base . . . that's very liberal. It'd be a tougher sell if you went into other fan bases to try and do that. The courage factor would be more impressive if NASCAR did it.""
But the league that stood up for LeBron James when reactionary media pundits argued he should shut up and dribble, rather than stand up and protest, effectively told Morey this week to sit down and manage after he spoke up to tyranny. Morey complied.
It was disingenuous at best on the NBA's part and cowardly at worst. 
To be sure, Turkish NBA center Enes Kanter on Monday tweeted apparent support for Morey. It was significant because Kanter long has voiced sharp rebukes of Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has cracked down on dissidents and journalists and cast such a shadow over his opposition, such as Kanter, that Kanter refused to travel to Europe last season with his team out of fear of being kidnapped by Erdogan's forces. 
At the time, Silver, the NBA commissioner, said: ""We live in a world where these are issues that he is dealing with. And I recognize that for the NBA, because we're a global business, we have to pay attention to these issues as well.""
The NBA doesn't have a billion-dollar tie to Turkey as it does to China. Maybe if it did, Kanter wouldn't feel so comfortable with his employer. On Tuesday, Silver again sought to claim some middle ground.
""It is inevitable that people around the world - including from America and China - will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences,"" he said. ""However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues.""
While that seemed to be supportive of the rights of NBA employees, it ignored the considerable influence the league could wield if it chose to. 
""The NBA is a uniquely positioned sports league,"" McChesney, an avowed NBA addict, pointed out. ""Basketball in the course of the last 40 years and continuing in the next 40 years is the second-most-popular team sport internationally. In soccer, you have five or six countries that have first-division teams and are roughly equal financially. But in basketball you only have one first division, the NBA. So the NBA is going to have all the best players in the world.""
That means the NBA can dominate the global basketball market, and the most lucrative mine is in China, where basketball has been part of the country since Mao Zedong promoted the game as an expression of communism's goals. 
The revenue China's market can provide NBA owners has helped drive the valuation of NBA franchises to the billion-dollar mark and beyond.
But that also suggests the leverage of the league. It is something coveted beyond U.S. borders and therefore, one could surmise, has the power to effect change. After all, sports' ostracizing of South African athletics starting in the 1960s, led by athlete-turned-writer Dennis Brutus, aided the fight against apartheid. 
""If the NBA said, 'Daryl Morey, you're absolutely right. We're cutting off China until they respect human rights in Hong Kong. We know it's billions of dollars, but we have to stand up for something,' then you would say: 'Wow. This is unbelievable. This is a sign of courage and principle we've not seen from an American commercial enterprise operating in China,' "" McChesney said. ""Then you'd give them the Nobel Peace Prize.""
But that's fantasy, not actuality.

Kevin B. Blackistone, ESPN panelist and visiting professor at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland, writes sports commentary for The Washington Post."
Cyberattack on messaging app came from China,"Telegram, the encrypted messaging platform, reported a massive cyberattack stemming ""mostly from China"" while the app was widely used by demonstrators in Hong Kong.

The company said it was hit by a powerful distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. In a series of tweets, Telegram said its servers were inundated with scores of ""garbage requests"" that interrupted users' connections and kept the servers from processing ""legitimate requests."" The junk requests did not threaten users' data, the company said.
Pavel Durov, Telegram's chief executive, said the cyberattack was traced to ""IP addresses coming mostly from China"" and that it ""coincided in time with protests in Hong Kong."" The app, which says it has 200 million users worldwide, has been used extensively in Hong Kong to coordinate demonstrations against a controversial extradition bill. Hong Kong police this week arrested Ivan Ip, who ran a Telegram messaging group with thousands of members. Officials charged Ip with conspiracy to commit public nuisance, according to the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post newspaper.
Hong Kong's protests ignited over a bill that would allow extraditions to mainland China. A reading on the extradition bill was postponed by lawmakers for a second time Thursday. Demonstrations had shut down central areas of the city and triggered a violent response from riot police.
The city largely returned to normal Thursday morning after demonstrators cleared out late Wednesday. Still, tear gas canisters and rubber bullets littering the streets offered reminders of the unrest. Hong Kong police did not provide the number of people arrested in Wednesday's demonstrations. Local outlets reported that injured demonstrators were being questioned by police at hospitals.
Telegram has been used for widespread protests before, and has faced government crackdowns. Last year, Durov said the app would fight Russia's attempts to ban the platform over data privacy issues. A Moscow court last year banned Telegram after the app would not provide encryption keys to a Russian security agency.
Iran also called on Telegram to block ""terrorist channels"" during protests in January 2018. An Iranian government minister said that if Telegram did not comply, the government would block the app. During anti-government protests throughout Iran, Telegram removed at least one channel that called for violence. But at the time, Durov said he would not shut down other channels deemed peaceful.

"N. Korea, others arming Myanmar despite atrocities, U.N. says","HONG KONG - A U.N. report released Monday said that defense companies from North Korea, Russia, China, India and at least three other nations have supplied arms to Myanmar's military in recent years, including weapons used in a crackdown against Rohingya Muslims that has been described as a genocide.
The report also noted that dozens of Myanmar companies - some of which spent years on a U.S. blacklist before sanctions were lifted in 2016 - donated more than $10 million to the military, responding to a call to fund the Rohingya campaign in 2017. After the army expelled about 700,000 Rohingya from Myanmar, these companies have helped to build infrastructure over the sites of massacres. Two years after their expulsion, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya remain in refugee camps in Bangladesh, with no clear timeline for their repatriation to Myanmar, nor a plan to address their grievances should they return.
""The revenue the military earns from domestic and foreign business deals substantially enhances its ability to carry out gross violations of human rights with impunity,"" the U.N. fact-finding mission behind the report said in a news release. It pinpointed 140 companies owned or controlled by the military. 
A Myanmar military spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The U.N. mission is mandated to investigate human rights violations by the Myanmar military and called a year ago for military leaders to be investigated for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. On Monday, it called for an arms embargo on Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, and sanctions against the military. 
The United States recently imposed a visa ban on Myanmar's military chief, Min Aung Hlaing, and his deputy. Washington, along with the European Union and Canada, has also imposed economic sanctions on lower-ranking Myanmar generals and troops.
""We'd like to see action extended to full economic sanctions, targeted against the people who lead the military and the military as an institution,"" said Chris Sidoti, a member of the U.N. mission. 
The Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, exercised total rule over the country until 2011, when it gave way to a military-backed government. The country held democratic elections in 2015 in which Aung San Suu Kyi rose to power as the de facto leader of a civilian government, but the military continues to hold significant sway over parliament, key ministries and the economy. 
It also controls two conglomerates, the Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings and the Myanmar Economic Corp. Min Aung Hlaing, the military leader, is the chairman of the first conglomerate. 
The 2015 elections prompted the United States, under President Barack Obama, to drop long-standing economic sanctions against the country that were meant to chip away at the dominance of the military leaders and their affiliates. But the atrocities against the Rohingya in 2017 again relegated Myanmar to pariah status, and Western businesses have largely steered clear. 
The U.N. report highlights the complicity of some of the companies formerly on the sanctions list, which still maintain close ties with the military, in the crackdown against the Rohingya in Myanmar's Rakhine state. After the purge began in August 2017, the report says, Min Aung Hlaing held ceremonies to solicit donations ""in support of the Tatmadaw's military and other activities in northern Rakhine against the Rohingya."" 
""During these meetings, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing made statements describing the conduct of the Tatmadaw in northern Rakhine, outlined the policy and military objectives of the 'clearance operations,' denied the existence of the Rohingya and advanced justifications for the Tatmadaw's acts,"" the report says. The ceremonies yielded more than $10 million in donations. 
The report highlights continued cooperation between North Korea and Myanmar, a long-standing relationship that was meant to have ended once the Southeast Asian country started liberalizing after six decades of isolation. The report notes that Myanmar has probably purchased a range of weapons, including rocket launchers and surface-to-air missiles, from one of North Korea's primary arms traders, the Korea Mining Development Trading Corp. The company is subject to U.N. Security Council sanctions.
""Arms relationships are very much a part of this long-standing relationship between these two countries,"" Sidoti said. ""The [Myanmar] military has shown very little sign of change, and it seems to be quite clear that it is still involved in arms trade with North Korea."" 
The U.S. government has faced pressure from human rights groups to impose harsher sanctions on Myanmar. Rights groups say the visa ban on Min Aung Hlaing still falls short and will neither lead to accountability nor hurt the military's revenue streams. 
Support for the military and its Rohingya campaign remains high in Myanmar, and many within the country believe the international community's response has been disproportionate. On Saturday, protesters demonstrated against the U.S. visa ban, and the U.S. Embassy in Yangon warned staff to avoid the area. 
""Americans, get out!"" the protesters shouted. A former member of parliament, Hla Swe, who also served in the military, appeared onstage in full tactical gear and denounced Suu Kyi and her government for not condemning the sanctions. 
""We are ready to defend our country from outsiders!"" Hla Swe shouted.

Cleanup begins in Hong Kong after protesters storm legislative building,"Damage reflects the growing anger of young demonstrators
HONG KONG - During the many hours it took for the swelling crowd to break through the glass walls of Hong Kong's legislature, several lawmakers forced their way to the front and pleaded with the protesters to stop. They and their calls for moderation were pushed away. 
On Tuesday, the results of demonstrators' successful bid to storm and briefly occupy the legislature - remnants of windows framed by jagged glass, graffiti, tangled metal barricades, hollowed glass doors - were on full display for anyone passing by the building. 
The message they left behind is clear: The city's young have arrived at the gates, and their anger and desperation cannot easily be quelled. 
""Generation by generation, people are getting angrier and angrier. As young people, we don't see any hope,"" said one protester who first entered the Legislative Council building late Monday and then later helped to coax out those who had vowed to stay behind to confront police. He spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of being arrested.
""We need to free Hong Kong. This is our home, and we don't want to leave it, even though we have so many issues,"" he said. 
Around the government complex Tuesday morning, police officers with handheld video cameras circled the building, filming evidence. They had repeatedly warned protesters that their brief occupation of the building was completely illegal. 
Police have not detailed how many were arrested over the action or what their charges were. 
Although protesters who had packed streets and entrances around the building were gone by Tuesday, the wreckage remained. City workers in straw hats piled up decorative shrubs torn from the ground, along with discarded shields and broken umbrellas. Others cut through the zip ties protesters had used to link together barricades to slow advancing police and block entry points to the building, which sits against the backdrop of the skyscraper-lined Victoria Harbor. The president of the legislature, Andrew Leung, said the remaining two Legislative Council meetings before the mid-July recess could not be held in the building, which he described as ""extensively damaged."" Leung gave no time frame for repairs. A meeting of the Executive Council, Hong Kong's cabinet, would be held Tuesday at the residence of the chief executive, Carrie Lam, instead. 
""I understand people in Hong Kong and around the world might not 100 percent agree or disagree with all of the behavior of the protesters,"" Joshua Wong, an activist and leader of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, told reporters outside the building Tuesday as cleaners swept up glass nearby. ""But when more than 25 percent of the population - more than 2 million people - join the rallies, and all of the requests have been ignored, is there any way out?""It was the outpouring of nearly a month of simmering frustration over the government's attempt to enact a bill that would allow for extraditions to mainland China and over its handling of the dissent that followed. Protesters were willing to risk arrest, they said, and some, even death. 
One 25-year-old protester who was not part of the effort to storm the Legislative Council, but who was participating in a march and occupying roads Monday, said the actions of that group inspired her. 
""[We saw] social media posts and live TV coverage about how the very front-line people basically expected years of jail and police violence,"" she said, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. ""I think emotionally it moved a lot of mainstream protesters in the march.""
One protester, who gave only his last name, Mak, said he had showed up expecting to protest just at the outdoor ceremony marking the handover to China. But the ceremony was moved inside. He ended up helping deliver supplies to those trying to break into the legislature. 
""We have nothing to do but try in this way to draw the attention of the Hong Kong government,"" he said.
The Civil Human Rights Front, which organized numerous marches against the extradition bill, including one Monday that brought hundreds of thousands of people into the streets, urged protesters to support one another. Although demonstrators may have differing opinions about what was done at the legislature, all ""love this city,"" the group said.
""While we do not wish to see certain actions triggered by tyranny, we fully understand the choice of the protesters,"" the front said in a statement. ""Last night, some of them chose to fight harder, not calculating their own personal costs. The fact is, they were just taking more courageous steps ahead of us."" 
The protests are representative of a broader fury over a number of grievances that boil down to the very legitimacy of their government and the gradual erasure of the Hong Kong identity. Since 2014, protesters have been fighting for universal suffrage in Hong Kong and for their government to be representative - calls that were echoed by those who occupied the legislature. 
""We've been used to our opinions [being] completely ignored by the government, no matter how loudly we've said it,"" the 25-year-old protester added, citing a 2009 Legislative Council decision to green-light a high-speed rail link between Hong Kong and Beijing and demolish a village of more than 150 households to make way for it. 
She was a 16-year-old student at the time and joined a protest outside the building. The passage of those bills convinced her that ""the control people have over this society is extremely minimal.""
Protesters who occupied the legislature were strategic in their use of graffiti and vandalism. They defaced portraits of pro-Beijing lawmakers, raised Hong Kong's colonial flag from when the territory was a British colony and blacked out the part of the Hong Kong emblem that makes reference to the People's Republic of China - all of this on the very symbolic anniversary of the handover of the territory to China. 
The protests represent a forceful challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has sought to tighten his grip over all of China's territories while stoking nationalist sentiment. 
News of the protests, and especially the violent turn they took Monday night, was largely missing from state media coverage in mainland China on Tuesday. Stories instead focused on the anniversary celebrations.
But in its first statements on the violence, the Chinese government painted the storming of the Hong Kong legislature as the work of ""extreme radicals"" who behaved in an ""extremely violent way.""
Protesters interviewed by The Washington Post say they understand that Beijing and their government hold the cards; many had participated in a 79-day sit-in back in 2014 for universal suffrage, an endeavor that failed. But they are unmoved.
""I will keep fighting for justice as long as I am alive, even though there is only a slim chance for Hong Kong to win,"" Mak said. ""But the Tang Dynasty only controlled people for more than 200 years. How long will it be for the Communist Party?""

Cascade of crises in East Asia confronts Trump,"Turbulence involves Pyongyang, Beijing, Seoul, Tokyo, Hong Kong
President Trump has sought to address two intractable challenges in East Asia - North Korea's nuclear weapons and China's predatory trade policies - but 2
1/2
years into his presidency, he is facing deepening turbulence in the region.
North Korea has resumed short-range missile tests, conducting four launches over the past two weeks, while the Trump administration's trade war with China escalated this week from a tariff fight to a broader dispute over currency, spooking financial markets.
At the same time, two major U.S. allies, Japan and South Korea, whom Trump has tried to unify to confront Beijing and Pyongyang, have been riven over a bitter trade dispute of their own rooted in historical grievances - a row that Trump has been unable, and more recently unwilling, to help mediate.
And mass pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong have sparked fears that Beijing will choose to intervene through force to stamp out the protests, presenting a test on free speech and human rights for a president who has given little voice to such issues.
""These are big problems,"" said Michael Green, who served as a top Asia policy adviser in the White House under President George W. Bush. He said that it was unfair to blame them on the Trump administration but that the president's lack of a clear strategy on trade and human rights has contributed to making the situations worse.
""These were all problems for the last three administrations. Nobody solved the problems, and Trump won't solve them either,"" Green said. ""But they're getting worse, and they're all converging now."" 
White House aides said the president and his team have been actively engaged in managing the potential flash points and reassuring U.S. allies of the administration's resolve. New Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are visiting Asia this week, while John Bolton, the White House national security adviser, visited in late July.
 Esper, who arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday, told reporters that, despite North Korea's missile tests, tensions between Washington and Pyongyang have ""been palpably lessened"" since Trump engaged in personal diplomacy with leader Kim Jong Un. 
He vowed to coordinate closely with counterparts in Tokyo and Seoul, and he urged those two camps to resolve their bilateral dispute and ""focus on North Korea and China.""
But Trump's own interest in resolving the spat between the allies has been in question of late. After holding three trilateral meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in during his first two years in office, Trump complained to reporters last month that dealing with their disputes is ""like a full-time job.""
The tensions intensified when Japan moved last month to curb sales to South Korea of chemical materials used to produce memory chips and semiconductors. That step was viewed in Seoul as retaliation for a South Korean court decision allowing citizens to sue Japanese companies for mistreatment of South Korean workers during the imperial occupation in World War II. 
 Trump said last month that Moon had asked him to mediate with Abe. 
""I said, 'How many things do I have to get involved in?' "" Trump said, recalling his conversation with Moon. ""I'm involved with North Korea. I'm involved in so many things.""
Last week, Japan removed South Korea from its ""whitelist"" of preferred trading partners. Thousands marched in Seoul over the weekend, calling for a boycott of Japan, and the Moon government is reportedly considering canceling an intelligence-sharing agreement with Tokyo.
Behind the scenes, Trump administration officials blame Moon for reneging on an agreement reached in 2015 with assistance from the Obama administration to resolve the historical issues. They said Trump pressed Moon and Abe during the trilateral meetings to resolve their tensions. 
The growing hostility between the U.S. allies comes as Pyongyang has renewed its provocations. On Tuesday, North Korea launched its fourth set of projectiles in less than two weeks. Nuclear talks with the United States have remained dormant despite Trump's dramatic meeting with Kim at the Korean demilitarized zone in June.
Despite the provocations, Trump professed in a series of tweets last week that he is confident Kim ""does not want to disappoint me with a violation of trust."" The president said the short-range tests, while potentially a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, were not covered in a verbal agreement he struck with Kim last year to maintain a moratorium on tests of long-range missiles and nuclear weapons. 
Danny Russel, who served as a high-level Asia policy official in the Obama administration, acknowledged that many of the challenges predate Trump's election. But he called Trump's approach to the region ""ineffective and often neglectful"" and said there is a ""crisis of confidence among America's Asian friends and allies who are increasingly vocal about their diminishing faith in America's reliability and resolve.""
 Trump has bruised U.S. allies and partners in his trade war with China by hitting them with tariffs as well. His administration also has pressured other countries to choose sides on issues ranging from Chinese infrastructure investment to sanctions on Chinese telecom giant Huawei, an unwelcome prospect for those who rely on open trade with both of the world's top economic powers.
""Countries in the region want to see an engaged United States . . . but they do not want to get caught in an all-out fight between the U.S. and China,"" said Richard Fontaine, chief executive of the Center for a New American Security who has advised Republican presidential candidates. ""To the degree that our approach and the Chinese approach look like an all-out fight, it's harder to enlist countries on our side.""
 In pursuing a trade deal, Trump has signaled that he is willing to sacrifice leadership on democracy and human rights issues. Last week, for example, Trump seemed to echo Beijing's hard-line rhetoric about the hundreds of thousands of protesters in Hong Kong, referring to the demonstrations against tightening controls over the island by Beijing as ""riots.""
 Trump also praised Xi for acting ""very responsibly"" despite reports that Hong Kong authorities have failed to protect protesters from physical attacks by pro-government groups.
But Bonnie Glaser, a China analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Trump appeared more interested in preserving his relationship with Xi than in voicing support for the protesters, a prospect she called ""really problematic"" in the tense situation in Hong Kong. 
Of the trade war, Glaser added: ""Neither side is really interested in negotiating in earnest on a deal at this point. It will be in this place until the election. If anything, things will get worse.""

Why it's the year of the street protester,"By last week it was undeniable: 2019 has become the year of the street protester. As hundreds of thousands marched in Hong Kong and Santiago, Lebanon and London, what has become a global explosion of people power was prompting panic among a host of governments - and raising some interesting questions about how and why it was all happening.
Of course, the phenomenon is not new, even in modern times. Since the late 1980s, when people took to the streets in the Philippines and South Korea, and then in the captive nations of Eastern Europe, mass movements of people have been overthrowing governments or, at least, creating political turmoil.
But this year is exceptional for the sheer breadth and diversity of the unrest. Hong Kong, which has now had 20 consecutive weeks of mass protests, has had perhaps the most noted uprising. But the Middle East has seen demonstrations in Algeria, Sudan, Egypt and Iraq in addition to Lebanon.
 In Latin America, Chile's riots followed mass protests in Ecuador, Argentina
and Honduras. In Eastern Europe, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic,
Serbia and Georgia have been rocked. Vladimir Putin has had to contend with the largest street demonstrations in Russia since 2102
. And the list goes on.
Why now? After all, the global economy is still growing, as it has for the past decade. In most of the world, poverty is declining. Governments in many countries where people are marching are corrupt, repressive or simply dysfunctional - but arguably no more so than they have been for decades.
Facile explanations have flourished. In Chile, where at least 18 people have died
in demonstrations, foreign correspondents who rushed to seek explanations from Santiago's left-leaning intelligentsia came away with a suspiciously ideological story: The ""neo-liberalism"" that Chile has practiced over the past 30 years, it was said, had failed. But wait. The poverty rate has fallen from nearly 50 percent to 6 percent during that time, living standards have risen dramatically, and inequality is less severe than in all but two other Latin American countries. 
Some Middle East analysts jumped to the conclusion that the unrest in Iraq and Lebanon showed that people were finally fed up with sectarianism, especially that promoted by Shiite Iran. Maybe - but that doesn't account for the uprisings in Sunni Algeria, Sudan or Egypt. A New York Times survey posited ""a louder-than-usual howl against elites in countries where democracy is a source of disappointment."" But that doesn't explain Algeria or Hong Kong.
A simple conclusion could be that the global unrest has no shared characteristics other than the tactic of taking to the streets. But I think there is more to it than that. Hong Kong and Egypt, Chile and Lebanon have two things in common: pervasive social media and a rising generation of discontented youth who are masters of it. The combination of the two has changed the balance of power between government and society in both democratic and authoritarian states.
Chile's protests began not with unions or opposition parties but with middle and high school students, who used social media to call on riders to jump subway turnstiles in protest of a fare hike. The protest went viral; the government, caught unawares, overreacted and called out the army. Soon the whole country was in turmoil. Similarly, Lebanon's unrest began with young people outraged over a tax on phone calls made on WhatsApp.
In Egypt, thousands of mostly young, male soccer fans took to the streets of Cairo in response to a call from a previously unknown businessman who posted videos on YouTube denouncing corruption. The panicked regime of Abdel Fatah al-Sissi responded by arresting numerous opposition activists who had nothing to do with what was an entirely new channel of discontent.
By far the most sophisticated use of new media is by the opposition movement in Hong Kong, which has used it to remain leaderless. Activists coordinate over secure apps such as Telegram; they used another app to identify and avoid police deployments before Apple pulled the tool under pressure from Beijing. As elsewhere, the backbone of the movement is young people, including teenagers.
This is a motivated generation, pushing for dramatic change in the political status quo. In that sense, the youth of 2019 are a little like those of 1968. Their command of new communications technologies makes it easy for them to attract followers, circumvent the usual channels of public debate and blindside governments. They are able to mobilize large numbers on small issues, such as fare increases, and tap into general discontent that otherwise might have remained unexpressed.

The mass protests they have generated have had very different aims in very different places. But they augur a new era of political conflict.

Protracted bid for Catalan independence prevails in run-up to Spanish vote,"Protesters fill the streets, even as some question the future of their fight


BARCELONA "" In a region battling to break away from Spain, pro-independence flags hang from wrought-iron balconies. Banners exalt recently sentenced Catalan leaders as 'political prisoners' and call for their release. Demonstrators say they are fighting for the democratic right to choose their destiny.
But that is only a partial view of a conflict that has deepened into a painful, region-defining deadlock.
Because in some neighborhoods of Barcelona, the flags disappear almost entirely. So does the sentiment that independence is a cause worth fighting for. As large as the separatist protests have been in recent weeks, just as many Catalans view the movement as tiresome and misguided "" a strain of populism that has succeeded only in delivering transit strikes, animosity and Brexit-style confusion about the future of the region.
'For me, leaving Spain is totally unrealistic,' said Pedro Fernandez, 55, a Barcelona bus driver who is in disagreement with his brother over the issue. 'When I see the independence movement getting more and more extreme, it pushes me in the opposite direction, and I get more intense in my own beliefs that they are right.'
The protracted bid for Catalan independence "" which crested with a unilateral 2017 referendum and a heavy pushback from Spain "" is often portrayed as a standoff between this wealthy northeastern region and the rest of the country. But as Catalans again take to the streets ahead of the national vote Sunday, with sometimes violent clashes with police, it is the divisions closer to home that have left the region feeling destabilized "" with no clear way out.
'We are living with a lot of conflict, a lot of trouble in Barcelona,' said José Martí, a vice rector at Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona. 'And this will only escalate.'
Since the Spanish Supreme Court last month convicted nine Catalan separatist leaders on charges of sedition, re-inflaming the demonstrations, many protesters here have come to believe that their fight for independence also represents something broader: a push against injustice and repression. Some say they feel in step with other movements that have decried corrupted governance, from Hong Kong to Chile. The protesters have torched trash containers and cars, thrown molotov cocktails and on one occasion occupied the airport, disrupting flights to one of the world's most visited cities. 
But opinion polls indicate that a slim majority in this region of 7.5-million people oppose outright independence. That group tends to feel that separatist Catalan leaders have overlooked the complicated questions of how independence would work "" whether companies would leave and whether a breakaway nation could remain in the European Union. They also say a split from Spain, given the level of opposition at home, could never be as clean as regional pro-independence politicians portray. 

Acting prime minister Pedro Sánchez has used the internal Catalan divisions to his benefit while taking an increasingly tough line with Catalonia. In an op-ed published by numerous outlets last week, Sánchez noted pointedly that separatist leaders won just 48-percent of the votes cast in regional elections, and he accused the region's president of damaging 'peaceful coexistence in Catalonia.'
'Where was the voice and the vote of those Catalans, the majority, who opposed independence?' Sánchez wrote.
In 2018, Sánchez told the Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia that any solution about the region's future requires 'a wide consensus that right now doesn't exist in Catalonia.'
There is broad disagreement about what might happen next in the region, as politically fragmented Spain approaches its fourth election in four years. The Catalan pro-independence movement has not fizzled, as many across Spain had hoped it might. But it also has not won international support or gained obvious momentum. Some pundits worry that protests could become more violent in the face of the stalemate. 
Catalan separatist politicians say there is one way out: holding another referendum, ideally this time with the official backing of the central government "" as happened with the defeated independence vote in Scotland in 2014. But Sánchez, a socialist, has shown no interest in greenlighting such a cause, and parties to the right, if they gained power, would not consider it. 
Santiago Abascal, the leader of the far-right Vox party, which is expected to make gains on Sunday, said in a debate on Monday that Catalonia is in a state of 'permanent coup d'etat.'
Sánchez and Quim Torra, the Catalan regional president who favors independence, have broken off talks.
'We had two meetings, but these negotiations failed,' Torra said in an interview Friday at a Gothic 15th-century palace in Barcelona that serves as the presidential headquarters. Torra blamed Sánchez for the breakdown, saying he had 'been scared by the right-wing parties in Spain' that are opposed to dialogue.

Without such a referendum, Torra said, 'instability will continue.' 
'We haven't been able to find a better solution than [proceeding] democratically and giving the voice to the people,' he said. 
Sunday's national vote, in which Sánchez's party is expected to win the most votes but fall short of a majority, is unlikely to change his calculus on Catalonia, experts say. They note that Catalan leaders have only wanted to discuss outright independence "" not lesser changes that could expand the region's autonomy. In the meantime, the two leading pro-independence parties in Catalonia have been fighting one another for regional primacy. 
'They promised people independence at a low cost. Now they cannot find a way out,' said José Ignacio Torreblanca, head of the Madrid office of the European Council on Foreign Relations.
But for all the impracticalities that come with leaving, Catalans who favor independence increasingly say that they have lost trust entirely in Spanish leadership. That's partly because of the Supreme Court decision announced in October, which separatists here felt was a deliberate "" and disproportionate "" strike against Catalan independence. Nine separatist leaders involved in the 2017 referendum and its run-up were convicted of sedition and given prison terms between nine and 13 years. They were all acquitted on the more serious charge of rebellion.
In interviews, politicians here speak about the imprisoned leaders as a reminder of the risks their movement faces "" and the cautions they need to take. Gabriel Rufián, a leader of the separatist Republican Left of Catalonia, said that when his mother calls him, she says hello to the authorities they both believe have tapped his phones. Another pro-independence politician, Laura Borràs, described visiting the prison where most of the sentenced Catalan separatists are held. She was there on the day that one of them, activist Jordi Cuixart, 44, was getting a visit from his wife and 4-day-old son. 
'This is one of the days when I felt dizzy,' Borràs said. 'This is the main feeling you have: That you are going out [after visiting] and they are staying in. You feel guilty.'

Two weeks after the sentences were announced, university students in the middle of Barcelona began a protest of their own, setting up tents in a city center plaza, draping them in Catalan flags and erecting a sign showing Sánchez reading, 'Sit and Talk, Coward.' One of the people camping out, Ferran Montserrat, 24, said people had gathered there not just in support of independence, but for other democratic issues, too. But he worried that the separatist movement had gotten stuck, while also taking on an angrier edge. 
'Two years ago, you had one million people smiling. That was hope,' Montserrat said. 'Now, it's like kind of a rage.'
Asked whether he knew anybody who opposed independence, he pointed in an unlikely direction "" at a friend who had showed up briefly to the camp to play cards and show solidarity on a cold night.
Ian Dameson, 25, said he had friends in Madrid and felt a connection with the country, not just the region. He spent his summers in the north of Spain. His father is French. Dameson said the pro-independence energy could be better used in other ways, fighting for economic changes or social programs. And besides, he said, an independent Catalonia wouldn't be so different from Spain.
'All the politicians would still be the same,' he said.

Hong Kong police use water cannons,"HONG KONG - Police turned water cannons against demonstrators on Sunday for the first time in months, as a protest descended into a street battle that left a main thoroughfare littered with bricks and empty canisters of tear gas.
Violence returned to Hong Kong streets over the weekend after a period of relative calm, marked by huge yet peaceful protests. The demonstrations, now in their 12th weekend, are having a significant impact on the financial hub - hurting multinational corporations, deeply unsettling residents, prompting changes in diplomatic procedures and raising increasingly urgent questions about how this upheaval will end. 
Sunday's authorized march in Tseun Wan, in the western part of the New Territories area that borders China, turned rowdy as protesters blocked streets and built barriers to hold back police.
A police officer fired a warning shot into the air from his revolver after protesters armed with metal rods tried to charge at the officers.
Riot police announced they would begin a dispersal operation, an emerging tactic as authorities grow less tolerant of the dissent that continues to grip the city. 
Bricks were thrown at police, who responded with rounds of tear gas and deployed water cannons acquired last year. They turned the cannons briefly against protesters, sending a group retreating into a nearby mall. ""I do worry about [the water cannons]"" said one 25-year-old protester, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing fear of arrest. ""And I can see lots of people on the scene; they do share the same fear with me."" 
He added that front-line demonstrators like him are ""still learning"" and had to be a bit ""conservative"" in dealing with the water cannons, which they saw for the first time on Sunday. 
""Maybe we retreat first and try to figure out how to tackle it later,"" he said. 
Rights groups have warned that water cannons are ""inherently indiscriminate,"" especially in Hong Kong's crowded streets and residential neighborhoods. But security analysts say the risk of collateral damage is lower than with tear gas, which has filled neighborhoods repeatedly over the past weeks and seeped into apartments. 
Authorities closed subway stops in and around neighborhoods where protests were planned, a move widely seen as an effort to limit participation. The MTR Corp., which runs the subway, has come under fire from Chinese state media, which has accused the transit authority of facilitating the protests and called it an ""accomplice to rioters."" 
In a service announcement Sunday, MTR called the closure a ""prudent measure"" to ""ensure the safety of passengers and our staff.""Police on Saturday arrested 29 people, ages 17 to 52, ""for offences including unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapon and assaulting police officers,"" the force said in a statement.
There were no immediate reports of arrests on Sunday, though riot police were seen pinning down and handcuffing protesters in Tseun Wan. 
The latest arrests mean that almost 800 people have been detained during the demonstrations, which started in early June over a now-suspended bill that would have allowed extraditions to China. 
The bill is no longer the protesters' main concern. Instead, they say, they are fighting primarily to keep Hong Kong's special status and to win democracy for the city in the face of an assertive, intolerant Beijing. 
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Saturday urged protesters to ""sit down and talk"" and aims to establish dialogue with the city's young people.

China detains American FedEx pilot,"HONG KONG - China is investigating an American pilot for FedEx on suspicion of smuggling ammunition, in a case that threatens to deepen troubles for a courier already caught in the crossfire of the U.S.-China trade war.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters Friday that customs officials in the southern city of Guangzhou detained a U.S. citizen Sept. 12 who was carrying 681 airsoft gun pellets in his luggage and planning to travel to Hong Kong.
The pilot was first identified by the Wall Street Journal this week as Todd A. Hohn, a former U.S. Air Force colonel. Hohn was carrying nonmetallic pellets used in low-power replica air guns in a checked bag and cannot leave China pending the outcome of his investigation, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
Hohn is out on bail and under criminal investigation for smuggling ammunition, Geng said Friday.
FedEx confirmed in a statement that a pilot was detained before a commercial flight in Guangzhou. ""We are working with the appropriate authorities to gain a better understanding of the facts,"" the company said.
China has some of the world's strictest gun-control regulations, and even many Chinese are not aware of draconian rules governing replica airsoft weapons, which fire pellets that can leave bruises but are seldom deadly. Chinese state media in 2016 covered the case of a man in Fujian province who was bewildered when he was given life imprisonment after ordering 24 replica guns from the Internet.
Hohn's case adds another pressure point for FedEx in China, where the company faces serious political risks. Chinese officials have opened investigations into the express service since June, and state media have suggested that the company could be placed on a blacklist of ""unreliable"" foreign firms after Huawei, the Chinese technology giant, accused FedEx of misrouting parcels and potential foul play. 
China's proposed unreliable-entities list appeared to be a response to Washington's decision to ban U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei after the U.S. government added the Chinese technology firm to a Commerce Department blacklist.
FedEx said this week that its business outlook for the year has darkened dramatically amid the U.S.-China trade dispute.
Chinese authorities have been investigating FedEx in recent weeks for illegally shipping weapons, including knives, to Hong Kong, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency. FedEx has said the package containing knives never left its origin city - coincidentally, Guangzhou, where Hohn was detained.
All summer, China has accused the United States of covertly fomenting protests and violence in Hong Kong, but has not provided substantial evidence.
Hohn, who left the Air Force in 2017, had passed through security and was waiting in an executive lounge for a Cathay Dragon flight home to Hong Kong when he was detained, the Journal reported.
A protracted investigation into Hohn could add strain to bilateral relations at a time when Western countries, including Canada, Australia and the United States, have accused China of seizing foreign nationals on murky or trumped-up charges to apply political pressure to their governments.

Wizards' game is disrupted by Hong Kong demonstrators,"Several demonstrators in support of ongoing protests in Hong Kong disrupted the Washington Wizards' preseason game at Capital One Arena on Wednesday night against a team from the Chinese Basketball Association.
As the NBA continues to face criticism for its dealings with China - a firestorm ignited over the weekend when Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey expressed support for democracy in Hong Kong in a since-deleted tweet and the league responded - at least five vocal demonstrations broke out before and during the first half of the Wizards' matchup against the Guangzhou Loong-Lions. In the second half, several more shouts of ""Free Hong Kong!"" echoed throughout the arena during the lightly attended game.
Before the Wizards' 137-98 victory, members of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation stood outside two arena entrances handing out ""Free Hong Kong"" T-shirts and holding signs admonishing the NBA for its initial handling of the fast-moving story that has mushroomed into a political battleground involving free speech and the league's financial interest in China.
""We basically and totally support the original message that Daryl Morey sent out in support of the protesters in Hong Kong that sparked this NBA crisis,"" said Marion Smith, the executive director of the Victims of Communism organization. ""I think the fallout has revealed how [NBA Commissioner] Adam Silver has put their eggs in the Chinese party's communist basket.""
Before the game, a group of men wearing ""Free Hong Kong"" T-shirts who were not affiliated with the organization, according to Smith, stood in the lower bowl of the arena as one held a sign reading ""Google Uyghurs,"" referring to an ethnic minority in Asia. Someone posted a video on Twitter of the sign being confiscated. Capital One Arena has a policy stating signs ""may not be commercial or political in nature.""
Following the singing of the Chinese national anthem, the first of the disruptions started.
With the arena lights still dark and images of the Chinese flag aglow on the overhead scoreboard, a single protester in Section 217 held a handwritten sign and shouted for freedom of speech and freedom for Hong Kong. His shouts cut through the silence in the arena, and he left his seat by his own volition while followed by an arena usher.
During the game, more protesters, sometimes in groups of two, scattered in various sections around the arena, shouted in support of Hong Kong or other causes.
A pair of pro-Tibet protesters stood near the front seats of Section 103, off to the left of the Wizards' bench. While one held a ""Free Tibet"" sign, the other raised a Tibetan flag. The men left the lower bowl after a security guard entered the stands where they were standing. The guard followed the men up the stairs as several Wizards players and staffers turned to watch the scene. According to a Wizards spokesperson, no protesters were asked to leave the arena Wednesday night.
""I didn't hear it,"" Wizards Coach Scott Brooks said of the disruptions during the game. ""I heard the one during the end of the national anthem. Other than that I didn't hear. I was focused on the game. The focus just right now is just on the team and how we need to keep playing and improving, and I have things that I need to worry about and be concerned of right now. I did hear the first part. I didn't hear anything else.""
The NBA and Silver have faced criticism over the past week as the league tried to respond to Morey's tweet and its aftermath. On Sunday, the league released a statement in which it expressed a recognition that Morey's tweet ""deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable."" Silver later offered another statement, declaring the league ""will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.""
For Smith, the statement was not enough, and he has called for Silver's resignation.
""I think it's extremely disappointing that Silver and NBA leadership came down like a ton of bricks on Morey to issue an apology and delete his original tweet,"" Smith said. ""This is not what the greatest sport in America is supposed to do, and I think Adam Silver is responsible for this. . . . We are calling for his resignation because we have been following this for a few years.""

A Nobel for the Hong Kong protesters,"A video clip from this weekend showing Hong Kong protesters politely parting ""like Moses and the Red Sea,"" as many later described it, to give way to an ambulance encapsulated an astounding month of activism and civic pride in a city that had already produced countless cinematic moments of model protesters.
It made me think: Why not give those protesters the Nobel Peace Prize? Judging by the response after I suggested the idea on Twitter, a lot of people agree - and with reason.
On June 4, citizens held a solemn commemoration 30 years after China's crackdown on Tiananmen Square demonstrators. Days later, they turned out again, this time against an unpopular extradition bill. An estimated 1 million people showed up that first weekend and, according to organizers, 2 million the second. Through it all, the protesters generally avoided violence and, while lacking a central leader, somehow seemed to intuit exactly the right things to do.
Volunteers set up first-aid stations. Drivers showed up with water and other supplies. Students returned to the streets the next morning to pick up garbage. In a more dramatic moment, a crowd turned into a Christian choir, calming two participants in a heated argument with ""Sing Hallelujah to the Lord."" In another episode, those retreating from tear gas paused to pass an umbrella and hard hat to an ill-equipped foreign reporter.

To honor the people of Hong Kong - the city of my birth - the committee would have to consider China's ire. Beijing put diplomatic relations with Norway on ice for six years after the 2010 peace prize was given to now- deceased Chinese writer and rights activist Liu Xiaobo. In a classically petty move, China slowed Norwegian salmon imports in retaliation.

At the time, Chinese officials pointed out that Liu did not meet the stated requirement of the prize to promote, in Alfred Nobel's own words, ""fellowship among nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and the establishment and promotion of peace congresses.""

By those guidelines, Hongkongers would not meet the criteria, either. But the Norwegian Nobel Committee has veered off Nobel's instructions over the years for a more expansive interpretation of peace promotion, and former committee members have regarded Mohandas Gandhi as the Nobel's greatest omission. The world's best-known proponent of nonviolent resistance, Gandhi would have recognized his legacy as practiced by the people of Hong Kong today.
In 2000, I covered one of the earliest demonstrations. Like many, I considered Hong Kong a politically apathetic city. It was just three years after the British handover of Hong Kong to Chinese control, and I found myself stunned, staring at a crowd chanting, ""We don't want a Beijing puppet!"" - referring to the chief executive of the territory at the time, Tung Chee-hwa. Only a few thousand protesters turned up. I could not have imagined that over some 20 years, the discontented would turn into millions.
Part of what explains the large-scale orderliness we've seen the past few days has to do with experience. Hongkongers have, unfortunately, felt the need to protest every year since the handover. In 2003, some 700,000 people took to the streets against another proposed law, Article 23. In 2014, the pro- democracy Umbrella Movement occupied the heart of the city for 79 days. Each time people turn out, it trains more of them on the best practices of protest. It also becomes a communion, a way to build a separate Hong Kong identity - one different from China, the bogeyman underpinning all the unrest.
Up to 1 in 4 people in the city have come out to say they do not trust the Chinese government. Even Hongkongers I know who did not participate, out of fear or even disagreement with the protesters, have expressed awe and understand that these days have made history. Such a turnout should be recognized.
Prognosticating is dangerous business, but the most likely fate for Hong Kong will probably be the one legally agreed to between Britain and the People's Republic of China, the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which gives Hong Kong until 2047 to maintain its autonomy and institutions. Many Hongkongers say they do not wish to become just another mainland Chinese city, but short of unlikely international intervention or pressure, that is exactly what will happen - and they know it. They are going down fighting, rather than submitting.
It is possible that, as hope dims, more will turn to violence out of desperation. But for now and for the past 20 years, Hong Kong has been fighting with grace. The people need all the encouragement and global support they can get. Will the Nobel Committee consider it?

Trying to enlist migrants in Hong Kong's information war,"Fliers in Indonesian language seek tips on 'radical protesters'
HONG KONG - In big red letters, ""WANTED"" cut across a collage of photos. One picture showed the Chinese national emblem defaced. Another showed a Hong Kong protester preparing to toss a Chinese flag into the harbor.

The flier called for information about Hong Kong's ""radical protesters."" The request, however, was made in Bahasa Indonesia, the main language spoken across the vast Indonesian archipelago - and among tens of thousands of domestic workers in Hong Kong.

The reward for being an informant: $25,500 to $127,500, a staggering sum for a domestic worker whose legal minimum wage is $590 a month.
It's not certain whether the tips-for-money offer was genuine or simply a new type of anti-protester screed. This much is clear: The bitter information wars in Hong Kong keep taking new turns since pro-democracy demonstrators took to the streets in June.
This time it is Hong Kong's domestic workers being drawn into the political tensions. The leaflets, which first appeared last month, did not specifically call out domestic workers. But the use of Bahasa made their target evident. 
The fliers - whether real or not - have accomplished at least some disruptions and indicate an intent to sow distrust and paranoia among Hong Kongers.
Suddenly, domestic workers feel under more scrutiny. Meanwhile, their employers - mainly expatriate workers and well-off Hong Kong families - are left wondering whether they might be watched in their own homes.
Information war
""Information war is a psychological warfare. Divide and conquer is a proven strategy,"" said Masato Kajimoto, a disinformation expert and assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong's Journalism and Media Studies Center. ""It is hard to go on protesting if one cannot trust the people who live with him or her at home.""
Hong Kong's nearly 400,000 domestic workers - about half from Indonesia - have largely been on the sidelines in the unrest. The community has come into sharper focus since police shot an Indonesian journalist, Veby Mega Indah, with a projectile on Sept. 29, blinding her right eye.
Hong Kong's Muslim community - which includes many from Indonesia - also came into focus on Sunday after a police water cannon sprayed the entrance of the city's largest mosque with blue dye while clearing an anti-government protest. Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, visited the mosque on Monday to apologize. Targeting domestic helpers as potential informants carries an eerie resonance with China's Cultural Revolution, a decade of political upheaval that began in the mid-1960s and included public denunciations of those considered at odds with the state.
It also highlights one of the central fears of protesters: that China will systematically erode the freedoms granted to Hong Kong under the ""one country, two systems"" policy promised when Beijing took control of the former British colony in 1997.
""Cultural Revolution again! For consideration of safety, please don't let your domestic helper know if you participate in the protest or not!"" said one Facebook message about the fliers. The post had more than 1,200 shares.
Nuraini Hasan, 27, a domestic worker from Indonesia's Lombok island, called the leaflet dangerous. She also said he believed it was fake, intended only to ripple fear through communities of domestic workers in Hong Kong led by Indonesians and Filipinos.
""We Indonesians don't believe this,"" Hasan said.
'Throwing a bunch of seeds' 
The flier's architect remains unknown. It lists a website, 803.hk, with a domain registered under the name of Leung Chun-ying, a former leader of Hong Kong who is considered supportive of Beijing.
The site was launched after protesters threw a Chinese flag into Hong Kong's harbor on Aug. 3 and offers rewards for information. Leung advertised the site multiple times on his Facebook page. In another post, he called on ""drivers, maids, fast-food store staff, convenience store staff"" to be whistleblowers.The hotline linked to 803.hk did not return messages for comment left by The Washington Post. Leung's office did not reply to requests for comment.
The challenge in quashing dissent in Hong Kong is pinpointing it. 
With all protest activity orchestrated anonymously online, the movement is largely leaderless. This leaves pro-government groups without an ""obvious place to look"" for targets, said Jeffrey Wasserstrom, a historian of modern China at the University of California at Irvine. 
""The power of that means it's much harder to break the back of the movement,"" Wasserstrom said. ""But from the side of oppression, it seems to have led to the idea of using any means to find who's participating.""
Puja Kapai, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong and expert on minority rights, called the fliers ""a call to essentially participate in covert spying activities.""
""Maybe [the creators of the flier] are just throwing a bunch of seeds out there to see which one shows the sign of blossoming,"" said Kajimoto, the disinformation expert.
SkepticismDespite the brief social media frenzy it sparked, the flier, with its sloppy translation and sketchy presentation, failed to woo domestic workers.
Among dozens of Indonesian migrant workers approached by The Post, few recognized the leaflet. Those who did called it fake and said they would never jeopardize their job. By and large, indifference was the prevailing sentiment.
Hong Kong is home to more than 174,000 Indonesians, 95 percent of whom are domestic workers, according to 2018 immigration figures provided by the Indonesian Consulate in Hong Kong.
""Some Facebook posts are not real. I don't care about that,"" said an Indonesian domestic worker, Rina, 33, when shown the flier.
""I come here just as a domestic helper. I just want to work,"" said Rina, who asked that only her first name be used to avoid potential problems with authorities.
In August, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube identified more than 200,000 China-based accounts linked to what Twitter described as a ""significant state-backed information operation . . . deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong.""
The Indonesian Consulate had no information pertaining to the flier, calling it ""quite unprecedented.""
""During this social and political crisis in Hong Kong, we have encountered a lot of unconfirmed or even false information . . . that are circulated among Indonesians living in Hong Kong,"" Erwin M. Akbar, consul for Consular Affairs, wrote in a statement to The Post. ""Our effort in the Consulate is focused on ensuring that the Indonesian Migrant Workers are not involved in the current situation in Hong Kong."" This includes not sharing any views on social media.
""Some care, some don't know,"" said Hasan, the worker from Lombok. ""We don't want to be very close, but need to know what is [happening]. This our workplace.""

New target for Hong Kong protesters,"Demonstrations are held outside businesses with ties to China 
HONG KONG - Protesters marched through shopping malls in Hong Kong on Sunday, targeting businesses with connections to China - or those perceived to be pro-Beijing - as demonstrations in the city stretched into their 16th weekend.
The new tactic showed a simmering anger toward the city's business elites, a relatively small group of tycoons and cronies who have accumulated enormous wealth and political clout, often through cozy relationships with the mainland.
The contentious extradition bill that sparked the ongoing political crisis was withdrawn earlier this month, but Sunday's demonstrations showed again that the deep unhappiness within the city goes far beyond a single piece of legislation and will not be easily - or quickly - resolved.
Hundreds of protesters gathered at New Town Plaza, a multistory shopping mall in the Sha Tin district. They targeted Chinese-linked businesses such as Maxim's Jade Garden restaurant, flooding the automated reservation system with requests and taping the receipts together to create an ad hoc protest banner.
Maxim's Caterers, the food and beverage conglomerate that operates Jade Garden, runs restaurants and bakeries across Hong Kong, including the Seattle-based coffee chain Starbucks. Protesters have targeted the company because its founder's daughter, Annie Wu, has been a staunch public supporter of Beijing. She spoke in defense of the Hong Kong government this month before the United Nations.
Tiffany, 25, a kindergarten teacher, said Wu was ""bending all of the reasons why we come out to the streets. She only sees what the protesters destroy, but she doesn't see the reasons why.""
Tiffany and other demonstrators declined to give their last names out of fear of repercussions from participating in protests not approved by police.
Peter, 31, a photographer, said Wu ""doesn't understand what's happening in Hong Kong. She said [the demonstrations] are destroying peaceful life in Hong Kong. Does she really know what's happening here?""
Wu spoke before the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva with Pansy Ho, a casino heiress who said protesters had ""hijacked the well-intended bill and used it to spread fear among Hong Kongers."" That prompted ridicule from demonstrators, who said Ho, whose worth Forbes pegs at $4.3 billion, was grossly disconnected from the people.
At V Walk, a shopping mall in the Sham Shui Po area of Kowloon, dozens of protesters marched past stores chanting ""liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time."" The group laid siege to a Best Mart 360 convenience store, part of a chain owned by someone with deep ties to the southeastern Chinese province of Fujian. The shop closed, and protesters let out a victorious roar before they quickly moved along.
A protester in a black mask said she learned of the demonstration on Instagram.
""We have to fight in different ways,"" said the woman, in her 30s. ""We have used a lot of methods already. Occupying shopping malls is a new one.""
By evening, in what has been a recurring pattern in the weekend protests, demonstrations that began peacefully turned violent. Police fired tear gas, and protesters hurled bricks at officers in the streets surrounding New Town Plaza. Flaming piles of palm fronds and cardboard sent plumes of black smoke into the sky.
Skirmishes with police continued into Sunday night. Protesters again gathered around the Mong Kok police station, a frequent site of confrontations, and jeered police officers. Several stops on the city's subway station were closed. 
Plans to disrupt transportation links to Hong Kong International Airport, one of the world's busiest, had circulated on social media and messaging apps in recent days. Protesters targeted the airport on previous weekends and have been successful in causing flight delays and cancellations.
But on Sunday, authorities deployed dozens of riot police to the main train station servicing the airport as a precaution. Officers in green fatigues, some carrying shotguns and tear gas launchers, stood in groups throughout the station.
Authorities reduced rail and bus service to the airport in an attempt to stop large numbers of protesters from making it there. That appeared to thwart the protesters' plans, but many counted it a victory that police deployed such a huge amount of resources only to have demonstrations pop up elsewhere.
The protests capped yet another weekend of unrest in the semiautonomous territory that has been in tumult for months. The unrest started over a the bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China.
Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's deeply unpopular chief executive, withdrew the bill this month. By then, the scope of the protests had broadened dramatically to include Beijing's tightening hold on Hong Kong and the use of force by police. Nearly 1,500 people - as young as 12 and as old as 83 - have been arrested since June, according to police.
Police and protesters also clashed on Saturday. Police said they didn't know the number arrested. At least one 13-year-old girl was detained in connection with the burning of the Chinese national flag. Police said Sunday evening she had been granted bail.
Protesters frequently target the flag and other Chinese symbols. They have popularized the term ""Chinazi""; stickers with the word, some with swastikas, were plastered around New Town Plaza on Sunday. Protesters formed a conga line in the middle of the mall to dance gleefully on a Chinese flag.
Police condemned protesters who they said attacked an officer Saturday and attempted to ""snatch"" his revolver. This was an apparent reference to a scene captured by public broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong, which showed a half-dozen protesters attempting to free a demonstrator who had been caught by police.
The group beat the officer with rods and umbrellas. One protester grabbed the officer's baton and used it to repeatedly hit the officer. Another protester pulled at the officer's weapon but was unable to free it before being chased by other officers.

Hong Kong turns cold toward mainland visitors,"The demonstrations in Hong Kong are increasingly flaring in its residential neighborhoods, miles from the harborside business districts where the pro-autonomy rallies began in the spring. 
The clashes are now on the doorstep of nearly every resident in Hong Kong, aggravating already tense relations between Hong Kong people and mainland Chinese visitors and residents.
The tensions in the neighborhoods are also spilling over to the mainland Chinese who come to Hong Kong every day to buy goods. 
Those who enter Hong Kong for a day, making use of multiple-entry visas that allow them to cross easily into the territory, are called ""parallel traders."" They buy goods such as baby formula, dried foods, cosmetics and electronics to take back to the mainland for resale. Unlike tourists, they are mainly seeking household goods, and residents say their presence has caused shortages of daily necessities such as toothpaste and milk.
But now the day-trippers to Hong Kong are facing increasing anger.
They are seen by some protesters as symbols of the mainland's reach into the former British colony. In July, a rally in the Hong Kong district of Sheung Shui denounced the parallel traders. In August, protesters shouted ""Take back Hong Kong"" at a bus carrying shoppers into the territory.
Retailers report a sharp drop in the number of Chinese coming over from the mainland. International tourism also has plummeted. Hong Kong officials say the number of international visitors fell by 50 percent in mid-August after protesters staged sit-ins at Hong Kong International Airport. Hotels have been forced to slash room rates.
The protests have sharpened the dividing lines over identity. Few people in Hong Kong think they can fully break away from Beijing's control, but there is an increasing embrace of Hong Kong as a place apart. Many locals call themselves Hong Kongers rather than Chinese, and they say the culture and identity of Hong Kong must be preserved.

U.K. official in Hong Kong disappears while returning from mainland China,"U.K. worker returning from mainland China possibly detained

BEIJING - The British government said Tuesday that it is ""extremely concerned"" by the disappearance of an employee with its Hong Kong consulate who reportedly was detained while returning from a trip to mainland China, in a case that threatens to further strain relations between Beijing and the West.
Simon Cheng, a 28-year-old trade and investment officer at the consulate, planned to attend a technology conference in the border city of Shenzhen on Aug. 8 and return to Hong Kong the same day, his girlfriend told Hong Kong news website HK01.com.
Cheng fell out of contact as he tried to pass through Chinese immigration that evening and has since been detained in the mainland for unknown reasons, she said, citing information she received from Hong Kong immigration officials. A friend of Cheng's who is in touch with his family confirmed to The Washington Post that Cheng has not been home since that date. 
The disappearance adds another irritant to the tense relationship between China and the West, which has deteriorated because of numerous disputes, not least the increasingly bitter trade spat with the United States. 
Beijing has accused Washington and London of fomenting protests that have convulsed Hong Kong over the summer. Canada has criticized China for holding two of its citizens as political hostages in retaliation for the arrest in Vancouver of Meng Wanzhou, an executive at Chinese tech giant Huawei who is wanted in the United States on charges related to alleged violations of sanctions on Iran. 
There is no indication that Cheng, a Hong Kong permanent resident, was traveling under a British diplomatic passport when he vanished. His public social media profiles show that he began working at the consulate in December 2017 after receiving a master's degree from the London School of Economics.
""We are extremely concerned by reports that a member of our team has been detained returning to Hong Kong from Shenzhen,"" a British Foreign Office representative said in a statement Tuesday. ""We are providing support to his family and seeking further information from authorities in Guangdong Province and Hong Kong.""
Hong Kong's Immigration Department said it had been in touch with mainland-based Hong Kong officials about the case.
Meanwhile, at a regular briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang denied knowledge of the incident.Cheng wrote ""Passing through"" and ""pray for me"" in a phone text to his girlfriend as he approached Chinese immigration at the West Kowloon high-speed-rail station in Hong Kong, according to HK01, citing images provided by his girlfriend. Under an arrangement between Hong Kong and mainland authorities, cross-border travelers pass through immigration inside the West Kowloon terminus.

Kerry Brown, a former British diplomat who heads the Lau China Institute at King's College London, said Cheng appeared to be a local hire who was not covered under the Geneva Conventions and was, therefore, more vulnerable than diplomats posted overseas.
""Far too frequently those who work in this situation are regarded by the Chinese as having divided loyalties. They are the ones who have pressure put on them, as pawns in a game,"" Brown said.
Details of Cheng's disappearance emerged as political tensions continued to simmer in Hong Kong following another huge march over the weekend. 
A proposal to allow certain suspects to be extradited from Hong Kong to face trial in the mainland's Communist Party-controlled courts triggered the weeks of demonstrations in the city, where many viewed the now-shelved plan as a ploy by local leaders, acting in concert with Beijing, to erode Hong Kong's autonomy and comparative freedoms. 
Hong Kong is governed under a ""one country, two systems"" arrangement within China, under which the territory is supposed to enjoy a high degree of autonomy for 50 years following its return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
Activists say there have been growing signs of Beijing's encroaching influence over Hong Kong, including tightening electoral restrictions, the expulsion of a foreign journalist, abduction of dissidents and the controversial opening of the train station where Cheng disappeared.
Arrangements at the station, which opened in September, allow for mainland police to operate and enforce mainland law within the terminus - the first time such measures have been permitted in Hong Kong. A report by the official Xinhua News Agency last year said that any traveler entering or leaving the station would be considered to be in the mainland and subject to Chinese law.
After the weekend protests, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam pledged Tuesday to hold talks with people from across the political spectrum but did not appear to budge on demonstrators' key demands, including the full withdrawal of the extradition bill and an independent investigation into police conduct during the protests.

Beware the 'moral hazard' in Hong Kong,"Watching videos of Chinese protesters singing the U.S. national anthem in the streets of Hong Kong, or hearing the tear-jerking chorus of a song from ""Les Miserables"" during a sit-in at the Hong Kong airport, only someone with a heart of stone wouldn't want to assist these brave people who are fighting for their freedom. 
But beware. The problem is that easy gestures of support could get these Chinese freedom fighters killed. It's a problem that insurance companies call ""moral hazard,"" when they inadvertently encourage people to take risks or engage in unsafe behavior by promising or implying that they'll be protected or rescued.
President Trump has been as erratic on Hong Kong as on most foreign policy issues. In the early days, he all but invited Beijing to crack down, calling the protests ""riots,"" and saying it was a matter between Hong Kong and China, ""because Hong Kong is a part of China."" 
This week, as a crackdown seemed near, Trump whined about being blamed for Chinese intervention and offered a ""personal meeting"" to resolve the crisis peacefully with the ""great leader"" President Xi Jinping.
Then, on Wednesday, he personalized the issue even more by linking a trade deal with Xi with a cooperative resolution of the Hong Kong crisis. 
Much as I dislike Trump's mercantilist and self-centered approach, he is avoiding one important mistake in the Hong Kong crisis. He's not implying that the United States is prepared to step in to protect the demonstrators from the consequences of their actions. He's not writing checks that the American people, in the end, wouldn't cash.
We need to be honest with ourselves and others: The United States won't go to war to save free speech in Hong Kong. It probably wouldn't go to war to protect the independence of Taiwan, either. The United States should subtly raise the cost of potential Chinese intervention and maintain some ambiguity about its actions. But we should be careful about facile rhetorical threats that raise the costs for others.
The Hong Kong protests present a problem that arose often during the Cold War years. Anti-communist freedom fighters rose up in Hungary in 1956
and Czechoslovakia in 1968. The United States had supported the overthrow of communism, and, in the case of the Hungarian revolution, the CIA had apparently maintained some covert networks of support. But when the crunch came, U.S. policymakers correctly judged that it was too dangerous to intervene. 
An idealistic, interventionist America has a tendency to make promises it can't keep. When protesters proclaim universal rights, we rightly stand with them intellectually. But sometimes we go further, implying that we're with them on the barricades, too. But that's rarely true - and for good reason: It's too dangerous. 
Too often, sentimental Americans are like the feckless lovers in 19th-century novels: We seduce, and then we abandon. 
The power of the weak against despotic enemies is that they start conflicts they can't finish - in the hope that a great power will come and rescue them. The Bosnians and Kosovars did that during the Balkan wars of the 1990s; Iraqi Kurds weaponized their vulnerability against Saddam Hussein at the end of the 1991 Gulf War. Arab Spring protesters did the same thing in Egypt, Syria and Libya beginning in 2011. 
When the United States encourages these uprisings, we incur a moral liability: If we don't come to the assistance of those whose hopes we've raised, we are diminished as a people. There's blood on our hands when the tanks roll in. 
But if we do intervene with our own troops, we make a far more dangerous commitment. The American people are still angry about the sacrifice of American blood and treasure during wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that weren't adequately anchored in U.S. self-interest.
What's the sound course between the moral hazard of recklessly encouraging risk and the moral blindness of ignoring brave people fighting for their rights? The right answer is awkwardly somewhere in the middle - supporting causes such as the democracy protests in Hong Kong, and trying to deter despotic powers such as China from intervening - without implying that we'll intervene directly ourselves to save the martyrs.
The State Department seemed to get it about right in its statement this week: ""We condemn violence and urge all sides to exercise restraint, but remain staunch in our support for freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly in Hong Kong.""

Keeping faith with people who nobly aspire to freedom isn't a spasm of support but a long game that plays out over decades. This is the restrained but steadfast approach that ultimately won the Cold War, and it's a commitment China will test at its peril.

Hong Kong protesters vow to press on despite removal of 'Lennon' murals,"HONG KONG - Beijing's supporters on Saturday answered the call of a firebrand lawmaker to strip pro-democracy messages plastered on walls and subway stations around this Asian financial capital, stoking fears of renewed clashes as anti-government protests push into their 16th weekend.
Supporters of the Chinese government removed vibrant murals of Post-its and artwork, known as ""Lennon Walls,"" which have become a symbol of the protest movement. In the meantime, pro-democracy marchers clashed with police in an exchange of gasoline bombs and tear gas.
""They want to tear down all the material because they want to silence us,"" said a black-clad protester named John, 30, who works in real estate. ""We don't care how much they tear down; we'll just come back tomorrow, every night and day.""
Protesters remained unfazed by the sweep of Lennon Walls and showed no signs of backing down. Nor does the government show any willingness to make concessions, and tensions are running high as the 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule in China approaches.
The public mosaics expressing support for the democracy movement have come to define Hong Kong's protests since they erupted in June over a controversial extradition bill. Though the bill has been shelved by the city's embattled leader, Carrie Lam, protesters are digging in on their remaining four demands, including free elections and an independent inquiry into police violence this summer.
Behind the mural sweep was outspoken lawmaker Junius Ho, who became a polarizing figure after a shocking subway attack on July 21 when a mob of white-shirted, rod-wielding men with Chinese flags stormed a station and indiscriminately beat civilians, injuring at least 45 people, including journalists and a lawmaker. Ho was accused of colluding with the attackers after he was filmed in the area that evening shaking hands with men wearing white. He has denied any connection.
Protesters preempted the sweep by plastering pictures of Ho on walkways by Lennon Walls so cleaners would need to remove them. Passersby took videos of themselves walking on the pictures, which had been marked with fangs and expletives.
""They have the right to do it,"" said Poon, a 35-year-old designer who identified himself by his surname, referring to Ho's supporters tearing down the murals. ""No one can stop them. They have the right to express their opinions, only no violence.""
Ho returned to headlines Wednesday after the powerful Hong Kong Jockey Club canceled a race in which his horse, Hong Kong Bet, was participating. The club said it scrapped the event due to ""potential social unrest,"" fearing the stadium would become the next protest flash point.Meanwhile, in Hong Kong's western area of Tuen Mun, thousands crowded into every inch of shade as they congregated in a playground. A small group of protesters played soccer while others handed out protest gear such as face masks and protective sleeves for identity cards to prevent the tracking of personal information. Police estimated that 4,300 attended the Tuen Mun rally.
Hong Kong's subway closed two stations ahead in anticipation of clashes.
Ostensibly the demonstration was about damas, or ""singing aunties,"" women who sing loudly into microphones in parks late at night and dance for men and donations. Depending on the neighborhood, protest events often take up local issues. A police ban on the damas event was overturned.
But as the shouts and cheers indicated, it was another anti-government demonstration. Protesters in the stands chanted ""Liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our times!"" and ""Add oil!"" Black-clad protesters played soccer before unfolding umbrellas to kick off a march under the sweltering sun.
""The Hong Kong government is still not responding to the five demands,"" said Harrison, 28, an airline worker. ""We want to keep fighting until the day they respond to our five demands. We keep fighting until the police pay for what they've done to us.""
By late afternoon, the march devolved into confrontations between police and protesters near a shuttered subway station. Protesters threw bricks, built barricades and set fires. A few burned a Chinese flag - a major offense in the eyes of Beijing. Police charged and fired tear gas.
The police have come under intense scrutiny since Amnesty International this past week issued a report accusing them of an ""alarming pattern"" of ""reckless and indiscriminate"" tactics against protesters.
Before Hong Kong, a former British colony, was returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, Beijing promised that the city would have a high level of autonomy for 50 years. Hong Kongers were supposed to enjoy freedoms denied to those in mainland China, such as rule of law, a free press and independent judiciary.

Anger swells in Hong Kong,"HONG KONG - Protesters filled Hong Kong's streets again on Sunday, cramming subway stations and turning roads into a sea of black, in another massive hours-long demonstration against their government's handling of a proposal to allow extraditions to China - even after the city's leader said she would suspend the bill. 
Organizers estimated the turnout Sunday at nearly 2 million participants, in a territory of some 7.4 million - making plain the growing rupture between Hong Kong's government, heavily influenced by Beijing authorities, and its people.
The march capped a dramatic week of protests in varying numbers across the global financial hub. Demonstrators forced police to open six-lane roads and took over streets that were not authorized for their rally.
The huge outpouring delivered yet more embarrassment for Hong Kong's leader, who finds herself increasingly isolated in the city despite her efforts to contain the growing anger.Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, said Saturday she would suspend debate on the bill in an effort to ""restore calm and peace"" to Hong Kong. After protests swelled on Sunday, she apologized to the people of Hong Kong for ""deficiencies in the government's work"" and promised to ""adopt a most sincere and humble attitude to accept criticisms and make improvements.""
But she has stopped short of withdrawing the bill altogether. She has insisted the proposal - which would allow fugitives to be extradited to countries without a formal treaty with Hong Kong, including China - is ""laudable.""
Lam's decision to back off the measure for now did not placate the crowds who showed up in a march that stretched more than three miles in either direction from its planned starting point. Police estimated turnout at 338,000, but they counted only the participants along the official march route.
Many expressed deep dissatisfaction with the way Lam has handled the bill and responded to the opposition. A 27-year-old woman in the crowd said the suspension of the bill has ""changed nothing.""
""She is so evil,"" said Sabrina, who gave only her first name out of fear of retaliation. She teared up as she spoke about Lam. ""She hasn't heard anything from us.""
Sunday's crowd, no less energized than in previous demonstrations, included the elderly, people with disabilities, children with their families, business executives, social workers and students, all demanding the permanent withdrawal of the extradition bill. The protesters, who waited for hours under a blazing sun to begin their march, chanted for Lam to step down and for Hong Kong to ""add oil"" - a Cantonese cheer that means ""keep going."" Banners called for Hong Kong's independence.
At one point, members of the crowd started singing ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"" - the call to action from the musical ""Les Misérables.""
Major roads across the city were packed with protesters - a thronging mass shuffling slowly toward government buildings that protesters had occupied on Wednesday that prompted violent clashes with police. 
Police presence around these roads and buildings Sunday was light compared with previous days, but the chief executive's residence was heavily guarded.
By evening, protesters had taken over Harcourt Road, the main street around the complex that houses Hong Kong's legislature. The road had been left open by authorities but was later closed to traffic.
Demonstrators held up signs calling for the government to withdraw charges against protesters arrested in Wednesday's clashes and for ""those who open fire to be held accountable"" - a reference to what many perceived as police brutality in response to those demonstrations. Police fired 150 canisters of tear gas within a short period that afternoon, along with rubber bullets, beanbag rounds and other projectiles to clear protesters. 
""People are really angry about the police brutality and the response of the government,"" said Nathan Law, founder of the pro-democracy party Demosisto.
As the demonstrations continued late into the night - with thousands of young people sitting down on roads that would ordinarily be busy with traffic - the Civil Human Rights Front, which helped coordinate the event, declared a historic victory for its movement.
Protesters rejected Lam's apology and reiterated their demands. They want her to withdraw the bill and to step down, and for police to be held accountable for the clashes on Wednesday. Until then, they said, they will continue to plan more mass action in their city.
One protester died Saturday after falling from a building on which he had draped a long banner that read ""No extradition to China"" and ""Total withdrawal of the extradition bill,"" among other demands.
It is unclear how exactly he fell. But his death further galvanized demonstrators. Some waited hours to leave flowers at the site of his death, where the smell of incense wafted. An artist in the crowd painted a portrait of the man, who was dressed in a yellow raincoat when he fell. One sign read: ""You will be the last. No more.""
""It is important for us to remember how people have sacrificed themselves for this,"" said Cindy, a 22-year-old protester who also spoke on the condition that only her first name be used, as she waited in a snaking line to place a single white carnation. ""We are here because we love this place and want to do what we can.""
The extradition plans were first floated after a gruesome killing in Taiwan, where officials say a pregnant woman was brutally slain by a Hong Kong resident who later admitted to the crime. Without an extradition treaty, prosecutors could not send him to Taiwan for trial but also could not charge him with murder in Hong Kong. He is in jail on a lesser crime.
Yet, Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, has not pushed for the man to be sent to Taiwan and instead has spoken against the extradition bill, saying Thursday she would not become a ""culprit to an evil law."" Taiwan has also said it will not be involved in any extradition proposals that imply it is part of China.
The protesters on Sunday included Kai Chieh Hsu, a 29-year-old Taiwanese man who flew to Hong Kong to join the demonstrations. He said he was there in solidarity and did not want his own country cited as a reason for a new extradition law.
""Taiwan and Hong Kong, we are both bullied by"" China, said Hsu. He said the murder case cited by Lam is a terrible justification for the bill.
""I'm really angry that Taiwan is being blamed for this.""
Many in Taiwan have supported Hong Kong residents and expressed admiration for their fight. On Sunday afternoon, a group of Hong Kong students in Taipei, the Taiwanese capital, organized a rally to support the protesters in their home city. 
On Thursday, some of the Hong Kong students met with Tsai's secretary general, Chen Chu. Among other things, they asked Taiwan to establish protections for political refugees from Hong Kong and Macau. In April, Hong Kong bookseller Lam Wing-kee fled to Taiwan, citing a fear of being extradited to China. Taiwan does not have a formal refugee law and has maintained it will decide the status of dissidents on a case-by-case basis.
In Taipei, the Hong Kong protests are raising awareness of the potential effects of China's influence. The extradition law has led people in Taiwan to ""care more about the situation,"" said Hong Kong student Katy Cheng, who has lived in Taiwan for three years. ""They don't want to be the next Hong Kong.""

Pro-Beijing gangs' apparent assaults on Hong Kong protesters stir concern,"BEIJING - They offered protection to Deng Xiaoping, a top Chinese leader, as he made a historic trip across the United States in 1979. They were publicly hailed as ""patriotic"" by China's public security minister in 1992.
They were courted by a Beijing official to smooth over Hong Kong's handover from British to Communist Party rule in 1997.
For decades, the ""dragon heads"" of mafia clans - known as triads - have been widely regarded as muscle-for-hire for those aligned with China's Communist Party, which has never denied the suspicions and, at times, even offers something of a knowing nod.
That suspected connection is again in the spotlight. Dozens of men, clad in white T-shirts and carrying Chinese flags, chased and beat anti-government protesters and bystanders with clubs in Hong Kong on Sunday, leaving at least 45 people hospitalized and bringing a new element of fear into a polarized city.
In the aftermath, Hong Kong legislators expressed worries that the city's political crisis was taking a troubling turn with the long-standing criminal syndicates known as triads entering the fray.
The attack sparked outrage from even those who lean toward Beijing.
""Are triads ruling Hong Kong now?"" the former head of the pro-Beijing Liberal Party, James Tien, wrote in a Facebook post calling on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam to immediately step down.
Experts say there is no evidence showing Sunday's train station attack was ordered by Chinese officials. But the melee provided a reminder of how the gangs, which grew out of southern China and operate today across several continents, are increasingly aligning themselves with the Beijing government.
Steve Vickers, former head of the Hong Kong police force's criminal intelligence bureau, noted the train station rampage came hours after demonstrators attacked and defaced the Chinese government representative's office in Hong Kong, a move that Beijing furiously warned had ""touched a bottom line.""
It was too early to conclude whether the gangsters were ""activated"" by a sense of patriotism or by the lure of easy money paid by China, said Vickers, who runs the Hong Kong-based risk consultancy Steve Vickers and Associates.
""Sunday's involvement by apparent triad societies represents a most worrying escalation to what is an already highly complex situation,"" he said.
'Totally stunned'
On Monday, police announced the arrest of six men, some of whom had triad backgrounds, for the mob-style attacks.
Hong Kong's police commissioner, Stephen Lo, pushed back against allegations that the force was intentionally slow to respond to the attack on protesters and said his department had been stretched thin.In a short statement, Lam denounced violence from all sides. In Washington, President Trump said he believed Chinese leader Xi Jinping had handled the Hong Kong unrest ""very responsibly.""
Lo Kin-hei, vice-chairman of the opposition Democratic Party and an elected district representative, said his party members had gotten word that a suspected mob attack would take place late Sunday. Local residents received vague warnings on social media to stay home a few hours before the assault began, he said.
Around 9:30 p.m. Sunday, smartphone video showed dozens of men storming into the train station, indiscriminately charging anti-government protesters in black T-shirts and bystanders with no apparent allegiances.
They beat victims cowering on the ground, cornered them inside subway cars and left the Yuen Long station floor smeared with blood. 
""Even though there were triad attacks in the past, they were targeting protesters who spoke out against their masters,"" Lo Kin-hei said. ""This time it was an attack against anyone, everyone on the platform, on the train. Hong Kong is stunned, totally stunned.""
Junius Ho, a staunch pro-Beijing legislator who was filmed congratulating the white-clad gang during Sunday's station attack, told reporters Monday that he was thanking the men for ""defending their homes.""
He denied that he had ties to criminal elements but refused to apologize for shaking hands with what he characterized as ordinary constituents - some of whom happened to be masked and armed.
""My job is to reach out,"" Ho said. He did not respond to a message seeking further comment.Local politicians and scholars say there is a decades-old but not widely known history of Hong Kong's criminal underworld embracing the pro-Beijing establishment.
In 1984, Deng was fixated on the strategy of how to reabsorb Hong Kong from the British. He remarked that the triads wielded disproportionate influence and had ""many good people.""
A decade later, Tao Siju, China's top security official, praised Hong Kong triads for offering Deng protection on foreign trips and told the city's newspapers that triads ""also love their country."" 
As Hong Kong transitioned to British rule, a former top official with China's official Xinhua News Agency, who acted as a liaison for the Chinese government, explained how he wooed the triads on Beijing's behalf. The argument was financial.
""I told them that if they did not disrupt Hong Kong's stability, we would not stop them from making money,"" Wong Man-fong said to a stunned university audience in 1997. 
Over the past decade, prominent Hong Kong media personalities, all Beijing critics, have been attacked. In 2014, after young anti-government demonstrators seized Hong Kong's streets during the ""Umbrella Movement,"" alleged triad members raided their encampment and cleared occupiers.
'Rent-a-mob'
It was a scene familiar in other parts of the worldwide Chinese diaspora, where local leaders sometimes have been open about their ""patriotism.""
As anti-Chinese government protests rocked the torch relay before the 2008 Beijing Olympics, one Chinese student leader in Canberra told the Sydney Morning Herald he was not concerned about dissidents marring the Australian leg because local triads already had ""quietened them down.""
In 2015, after anti-China protesters occupied the Taiwanese legislature, they were roughed up and dispersed by a gang led by Chang An-lo, the notorious founder of the Bamboo Union triad who went by the nom de guerre ""White Wolf."" 
After doing a stint in U.S. federal prison for heroin trafficking and racketeering, Chang returned to Taiwan in 2013 to form a political group promoting political unification with mainland China. Taiwanese police have probed the group's ties with organized crime.
""There's a proven link between the Bamboo Union triad and activities on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party,"" said J. Michael Cole, a senior fellow at the Global Taiwan Institute. ""What we saw in Hong Kong this week is a logical escalation of what we've seen for the past decade.""
Chinese state television repeatedly aired video of the defaced government office, blaming what it called U.S. instigation in the Hong Kong protests. Rhetoric on mainland Chinese social media also hardened. ""Guard and protect Hong Kong"" became the top trending hashtag.
Alvin Y.H. Cheung, a scholar at the U.S.-Asia Law Institute at New York University, said there has been concern for years about triad influence in Hong Kong politics. But the events of this week's suggested something new.
""Triad members operating in the open and beating up civilians - that is relatively new,"" he said. ""It's the same rent-a-mob playbook you've seen in other authoritarian jurisdictions.""

Hong Kong protesters continue calls for full withdrawal of extradition bill,"Demonstrators surround police headquarters amid allegations of misconduct
HONG KONG - Thousands of demonstrators again blocked main city thoroughfares on Friday and, in a new show of displeasure, surrounded police headquarters, demanding that a deeply unpopular extradition bill be fully withdrawn by the city's leader and that police investigate cases of alleged police brutality.
For more than a week, enormous numbers of protesters have taken to the streets of the semiautonomous territory, calling for the scrapping of a bill that would allow for extraditions to China. The continued upheaval has placed Carrie Lam, the pro-Beijing chief executive, at the center of the most serious crisis of her political career.
Lam has suspended the bill and offered up two public apologies but has refused to withdraw the legislation completely. Her apologies have been dismissed as self-serving, and many continue to demand that she resign.
Some government offices downtown were closed Friday in anticipation of the rallies.
Friday's protests were originally organized, in part, by the student unions of Hong Kong universities but gathered support online and through messaging apps popular with younger demonstrators. Student leaders had given the government until 5 p.m. local time on Thursday to respond to a list of four demands or face new protests.
In addition to seeking the withdrawal of the bill and a police misconduct investigation, they also want charges against those arrested during past protests to be dropped and the retraction of references to the June 12 protest as a ""riot.""So Tsun-Fung, the president of the student union of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said students were disappointed and angered by the government's response. ""We need to put more pressure on the government,"" he said.
Although some have questioned the wisdom of the latest protest, which comes less than a week after an estimated 2 million people took to the streets, So said they needed to maintain momentum. ""If we wait, it will be too late,"" he said.
Harcourt Road, a major motorway through Hong Kong's central district, has been a focus of past demonstrations, including last week's occupation that ended with police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters.
On Friday, protesters again blocked the road, though the crowds were thinner than during previous closures. After speaking out on Lam, demonstrators are now directing their anger toward the police. In recent days, videos of officers arresting protesters and firing tear gas have been shared widely on social media, eliciting outrage.
Outside police headquarters, protesters pelted officers with eggs, which splattered on police riot shields.
Artwork depicting the police violently confronting protesters has popped up around the city, as have groups projecting videos of the incidents onto screens in public.

Sonia, 18, who spoke on the condition that only her first name be used, said she was frustrated with police dismissing the complaints of young people and telling them to submit their grievances by email.
""We are all very angry about it,"" she said. ""The people who the police hurt are young people and students. They are vulnerable citizens."" 
Like many in attendance, she had obscured her face with a dental mask.
Another protester, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely, said that while she understood police had a job to do, they acted in a ""totally unreasonable"" manner dispersing crowds on June 12. She cited a widely shared video showing a demonstrator being roughly apprehended by a group of about six officers.
Protesters taped photos of police firing tear gas and injured demonstrators to the police complex. Others blocked a police van in the road and pushed metal barricades against some doors to the building. A small group of protesters scaled the walls surrounding the police headquarters to cover surveillance cameras with tape or block them with opened umbrellas. 
With temperatures in the high 80s and stifling humidity, many took refuge in the shade of underpasses and stuck cooling patches to their foreheads. Officers stood in a line blocking the front door. One officer filmed protesters with a handheld camera.
The Hong Kong Police Force, which has previously defended its actions, said in a post on Twitter that the gathering would ""seriously affect the emergency services provided by police.""
The police force added in a statement Friday afternoon that it could not respond to about two dozen calls to the 999 emergency hotline because of the large crowd blocking roads. Joshua Wong, who rose to prominence as a leader of the 2014 Umbrella Movement and was just released from prison, addressed the crowd and called for Police Commissioner Stephen Lo to meet with protesters to hear their grievances.
Wong was absent from the mass demonstrations of the past month because he was serving a jail term for charges stemming from the 2014 protests, during which demonstrators paralyzed major roads in a 79-day occupation of central Hong Kong calling for universal voting to pick Hong Kong's leaders.

Debate on Hong Kong extradition bill shelved,"Vote previously set for June 20 delayed after massive protests

HONG KONG - Hong Kong's legislative body on Thursday canceled debate for the rest of the week on a flash-point bill to allow extraditions to mainland China - leaving protesters emboldened and planning another major show of resistance against Beijing's efforts to reshape the rules governing the former British colony.
The delay in the extradition bill was hailed as a symbolic victory among the demonstrators who have poured into Hong Kong's streets this week. It also could become a rallying cry for another massive rally on Sunday.
Lawmakers are still expected to move ahead with the measure, which protesters view as another blow to Hong Kong's freedoms and special status since returning to Chinese control more than two decades ago.
""We will still try our best to stall the passing of this very evil law,"" said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker, in an interview. ""It might be a losing battle we are fighting, but we still need to keep up the fight. We can't just take it lying down.""
Authorities, meanwhile, stepped up their own crackdowns in response.
Arrests included some activists at hospitals where they were getting treatment for injuries sustained as a result of police tactics. Tweets from Hong Kong University students described police searches through dorm rooms.
A cyberattack on Telegram, a messaging app widely used for organizing the protests, underscored the tech-focused worries of protesters trying to evade and foil some of the world's most sophisticated surveillance systems.
Telegram founder Pavel Durov said the hack originated from ""IP addresses coming mostly from China,"" but gave no further details. The app was hit with a powerful distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, which clogs servers with junk requests.
""Historically, all state actor-sized DDoS . . . we experienced coincided in time with protests in Hong Kong,"" he wrote. ""This case was not an exception.""

Many demonstrators left the streets they had occupied. But they showed no signs of backing down.
Throughout the day, pockets of protesters wearing black clothes, with surgical masks obscuring their faces, wandered the streets near the Legislative Council, the territory's lawmaking body.
A silent vigil was held on a pedestrian bridge leading to the complex. The demonstrators held up signs including ""Stop shooting Hong Kong students,"" and they created a sea of black T-shirts across the walkway as metal barricades and rubbish littered the ground below.
A heavy police presence remained throughout the city, blocking the road leading to the chief executive's residence.
The Legislative Council, meanwhile, again postponed a reading on the extradition bill, canceling sessions on Thursday and Friday. The law would allow Hong Kong to extradite fugitives to countries it does not have a formal treaty with, including mainland China - removing a long-held ""firewall"" between the legal systems of the two jurisdictions.
The legislature had previously said it would bring the bill to a vote by June 20. Andrew Leung, the council's president, had reserved 66 hours for debate.
Lawmakers said it would be hard for the legislature to keep to the planned timetable. Hong Kong's legislature is controlled by a pro-Beijing faction that has the votes to push forward the law.
The Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) - the group that organized the massive protest Sunday in opposition to the bill, with a historic turnout of more than 1 million people - called for more demonstrations over the weekend and into Monday.
""All Hong Kong people are holding on to the end!"" the group said.
Pro-democracy lawmakers and human rights groups condemned the actions of police, who pushed back on demonstrators with tear gas and rubber bullets. Police said Thursday that they had released 150 canisters of tear gas in just a few hours during the afternoon. The Hong Kong hospital authority said 81 people were injured in the protests; the youngest of them was 15 years old.""This excessive response from police is fueling tensions and is likely to contribute to worsening violence, rather than end it,"" said Man-Kei Tam, director of Amnesty International in Hong Kong.
""We urge the Hong Kong police not to repeat such abuses against peaceful protesters, and instead ensure people can legitimately exercise their rights.""
Stephen Lo, the police commissioner, said police had made 11 arrests related to the protests on Wednesday. Separately, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post newspaper reported that Ivan Ip, the administrator of a Telegram messaging group with thousands of members, had been arrested at his home and charged with conspiracy to commit public nuisance. Injured demonstrators were being questioned by police upon arrival at nearby hospitals, prompting some to seek treatment further from central Hong Kong.
""I consider our officers are acting in accordance with guidelines,"" said Lo in a news conference. ""We have absolutely no bad intention to cause trouble to anyone. We are just doing our duty.""
Lo added that the Hong Kong police did not have any assistance or direction from the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA).
Unlike the 2014 ""Umbrella Revolution"" protests that brought a 79-day occupation of Hong Kong's main arteries, these demonstrations do not appear to have clear leadership, a probably intentional move aimed at making it harder for authorities to imprison activists. Leaders and organizations associated with the 2014 protests have been convicted on a variety of charges. Most recently, two professors who founded the movement were sentenced to 16 months in jail.
Demonstrators say they were taking a stand against the tightening grip Beijing is exerting over the semiautonomous territory, which was promised a degree of independence and democratic rule when it was handed over from the British to China in 1997.
The erosion of the city's identity and way of life, they say, will speed up if the extradition bill passes: a nail in the coffin of the ""one country, two systems"" framework that guarantees Hong Kong residents rights including the freedom to demonstrate.
""[Chinese president] Xi Jinping has touched on the issue again and again that Hong Kong has to match [Beijing] on issues like national security and economic development,"" said Ivan Choy, a political scientist at Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""It means that Hong Kong has to pay more attention to one country, rather than two systems.
""Hong Kong is losing its own autonomy, and it is integrating into the whole system politically,"" he said.
Yet, the stark differences between the mainland and Hong Kong were on clear display with a glance at Chinese state media. The English-language Global Times, which typically runs stories accusing the United States and Western countries of puppeteering Hong Kong, quoted someone advocating more harsh ""direct"" police action against the ""masked, violent activists.""
Wednesday's protests had support from a wide swath of Hong Kong society. People showed up in droves offering donations, supplies and medical care to the demonstrators. Many small businesses also shut down for the day in solidarity.
And in a complete distortion of facts, the China Daily English-language newspaper, run by the Chinese Communist Party, said 800,000 had demonstrated in support of the extradition laws Sunday.
""Two fleets of fishing boats sailed through Victoria Harbour in a two-hour sea parade organized by the Hong Kong Fishermen Consortium, displaying banners with slogans in support of the bill,"" the article said.
In reality, more than 1 million people filled the streets of Hong Kong Sunday to demonstrate against the extradition measure, in a historic turnout, marching through the night.
Mainland China residents seemed largely unaware Wednesday of the events in Hong Kong.
""No. What's going on?"" a young Beijing woman in her 20s replied when The Washington Post asked whether she had heard the news.
Other Beijing residents passing through a crowded shopping street at lunchtime also claimed ignorance.
""Our Internet is a local-area network, and we can only see what they want us to see,"" said one man in his 30s.

Dozens of Hong Kong protesters appear in court on charges of rioting,"Possible sentence of up to 10 years signals intensifying crackdown
HONG KONG - A nurse, a pilot and students were among dozens of anti-government protesters who appeared in court Wednesday on charges of rioting, after an unauthorized weekend demonstration escalated into chaotic street battles with police.
The decision to charge more than 40 people with an offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison signaled an intensifying crackdown by Hong Kong's Beijing-backed authorities on a protest movement that is becoming increasingly violent.
The political crisis was sparked by a government proposal to allow semiautonomous Hong Kong to extradite suspects wanted by China to face trial in mainland courts. Although Hong Kong officials have suspended the bill, they have refused to withdraw it or compromise on protesters' other demands, such as an independent inquiry into police actions. The protest movement has grown to encompass a long-held aspiration for universal suffrage.
Outside the packed courtroom on Wednesday, as an approaching tropical storm brought torrential rain and strong winds to the city, hundreds of protesters gathered to offer support for the defendants. Some chanted ""Revolution of our time!"" and ""Release the defendants!"" Inside, as bail conditions were read out, an elderly woman cried and hugged one of the defendants.
All of the accused - ages 16 to 41 - were granted bail, most with curfew conditions. Some bore scratches and bruises sustained in Sunday's protest. They are to reappear in court in mid-September.
The court hearing followed clashes Tuesday evening between officers and protesters who surrounded a police station to voice anger at the rioting charges. At one point, protesters were attacked with fireworks launched from a passing car; at least seven were taken to the hospital.
Police said earlier Tuesday that they had charged 44 people with rioting in connection with the Sunday protest. One faced an additional charge of assaulting a police officer, and a 45th person was charged with possession of an offensive weapon. Police said more arrests were possible as their investigation continued.
Protesters over the weekend defied authorities and marched in Hong Kong streets for the eighth consecutive weekend. Police had warned that the demonstrations were illegal and that protesters would be arrested if they did not leave the scene. On Sunday evening, police used force to clear demonstrators from densely populated areas of the city, deploying so much tear gas that it seeped into surrounding homes and left passersby choking.
Demonstrators had also prepared for battle, arming themselves with shields and bricks. Some used hand protection so that they could throw hot tear gas canisters back at police. Officers responded by charging at protesters, hitting some with batons and leaving more than a dozen injured.
Some of those charged, however, said they had nothing to do with the clashes and happened to be in the wrong place at the time. One female defendant charged with rioting, who declined to be named because of the criminal case, said she was among protesters who were moving back from police lines when canisters of tear gas were fired.
She was initially detained on a charge of illegal assembly, like the others arrested Sunday, before that was increased to rioting.
""All of us, we are made an example of,"" she said, adding that officers had pushed her to the ground. ""I didn't think this would happen. We are all just chasing justice and fighting for our rights.""
Chinese authorities in recent days have backed a tougher stance toward the protests, which have increasingly taken on an anti-Beijing flavor. The central government's Hong Kong liaison office held an unprecedented news conference Monday to signal its support for Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and called for the punishment of ""radicals.""
""The most pressing task for the moment is to punish violence and maintain order,"" said Yang Guang, a spokesman for the office.
Beijing authorities, meanwhile, have said nothing about a mob attack on anti-government protesters who were returning from a march as well as on bystanders, leaving 45 injured. Several members of the club-wielding mob have been arrested, but on a lighter charge of unlawful assembly.
Man-kei Tam, the director of Amnesty International Hong Kong, said authorities ""seem intent on sending a chilling warning to anyone considering taking part in future protests.""
""While there was violence over the weekend, the definitions of illegal assembly and rioting under Hong Kong law are so broad they fall far short of international standards,"" he said. ""It is highly questionable that individuals facing these sweeping charges would have a fair chance of defending themselves at trial.""
The riot charges have further fueled the protest movement. More protests, including one organized by civil servants, are planned in the coming days, and trade unions are calling for a general strike Monday.

"China's firewall between mainland, Hong Kong","Beijing moves to prevent any spillover from pro-democracy protests 
HONG KONG - When Bella, a mainland Chinese student, returned home after a week-long program in Hong Kong, it didn't occur to her to take any special precautions. She hadn't ventured near the protests that have rocked the city.
Approaching the mainland border point last month, the 21-year-old was pulled aside along with several others. Officers combed her phone, discovering Facebook and its Messenger app, both banned in China. She said her entry permit - a card used by mainland Chinese to travel to and from Hong Kong - was briefly confiscated while officers questioned her and accused her of deleting messages to hide unspecified evidence. 
""I was shocked that they would do that without reason,"" said Bella, who gave only her first name for fear of reprisal, explaining that she had downloaded Facebook to follow fan pages of her musical idol, David Bowie. ""I kept trying to explain, but the officers wouldn't believe me."" 
As protests in Hong Kong have intensified into a rebellion against the Chinese state and its increasing grip over the former British colony, Beijing has grown anxious about any kind of spillover to the mainland.
Chinese officials are trying to solidify an ideological iron curtain between Hong Kong and mainland China - tracking people who go back and forth, ratcheting up propaganda, and intimidating protest sympathizers - to ring-fence the mainland from protesters' pro-autonomy viewpoints.
This campaign is playing out at border crossings, in cyberspace and on college campuses as far afield as Australia and the United States. 
The Washington Post spoke to almost a dozen Chinese students and young professionals who have been stopped and searched at the border. Others on the mainland say they have been pressured by Chinese authorities to delete social media accounts and threatened with arrest for expressing views deemed supportive of protesters.Ideological firewall
For President Xi Jinping, these efforts reflect the dilemma of how to ideologically insulate his country even as the Chinese are increasingly immersed in the world, including 520,000 students flowing yearly out of its borders. 
This conundrum is especially acute when it comes to Hong Kong, which Beijing has been trying to integrate socially and economically since the territory's 1997 return to Chinese sovereignty, while keeping the financial hub's relative freedoms from seeping into the mainland.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States reminded Chinese students in an open letter this week to be ""representatives for this generation of Chinese youth"" at American campuses and ""demonstrate young Chinese peoples' feelings and responsibilities through openness and confidence.""
When Chinese students in Hong Kong returned to the city after summer break, a text message sent to their phones from Chinese provincial authorities urged them to ""unwaveringly uphold a position of loving the country and loving Hong Kong"" and ""by no means"" attend any protests. 
Chinese authorities usually block social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter by using a censorship apparatus nicknamed the Great Firewall. Yet they allowed hundreds of nationalist youths to use special software last week to vault over the firewall and flood international social networks with pro-Beijing messages.
State media has at times stayed silent on major developments in Hong Kong, including the news Wednesday that Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam had withdrawn the contentious extradition bill that sparked the crisis.
At other times, Chinese authorities have splashed stories about the Chinese flag being hurled into the sea and promoted viral hashtags on Weibo - the country's version of Twitter - with pro-Beijing messages such as: ""The five-star red flag has 1.4 billion guardians. I'm one of them!"" 
The information gap has sometimes generated confusion on Chinese social media. Some users were puzzled about why Hong Kong's stock market suddenly shot up Wednesday afternoon, when breaking news about the extradition bill's withdrawal was suppressed on the mainland. Other Chinese who had seen weeks of coverage about violent protests wondered why the government would cave to a radical fringe.'Harmful trend'
Some Chinese citizens have tried to offer a different perspective, using virtual private network (VPN) software to access Facebook and Twitter and to read international news reports on the protests.
Byron Chen, a 34-year-old teacher at an international school, attended a July 14 rally organized by the Hong Kong Journalists Association, which advocates unfettered media access to the protests. He posted a picture on his WeChat page, stressing the legal and peaceful nature of the gathering.
One of his contacts saved the photo and distributed it with the teacher's personal details. It was soon picked up by Chinese nationalists with huge followings on Weibo. Soon, he was flooded with online messages calling for his death or imprisonment. Plainclothes officers paid him a visit, he said, and have barred him from going to Hong Kong without prior approval. 
""I feel sympathy for the protesters, but above all, I'm concerned of the rising totalitarianism and centralization of state power I see in China, which is a really harmful trend,"" he said in an interview. 
Chen said he has been forced to ""think twice"" before expressing his views, especially on Chinese social media apps. Getting outed online for liberal views, he added, is ""nearly a death penalty"" in China. 
Andreas Fulda, the author of a book on efforts at democratization in China and a senior fellow at the University of Nottingham's Asia Research Institute, said voices like Chen's are ""not being heard."" 
""But we shouldn't think that these voices do not exist,"" he added. 
Public figures in China who have urged their countrymen to have an open mind about the Hong Kong crisis also have been silenced. Last month, Chen Qiushi, a Beijing lawyer known for his online commentaries on social issues, told his more than 700,000 Weibo followers that he was skeptical about reports of widespread ""rioting"" and traveled to Hong Kong to get a look on the ground.
""We can't simply divide people into good or bad. People are complicated. People engage in all kinds of thinking,"" Chen told his audience in a live stream from Hong Kong's streets as marchers walked past in August. ""Not all of them are rioters.""
That crossed the line. Days later, Chen's videos were removed. His family and colleagues, under pressure from authorities, urged him to quickly return to Beijing. He hasn't been able to talk publicly since, said Xu Xiaodong, a friend of Chen's who is also an outspoken social media personality.
Xu, a mixed martial arts fighter by trade, said his social media accounts also were shut last month after he, like Chen, asked his followers how 2 million Hong Kongers could possibly all be labeled rioters. Days later, in late August, he was visited by authorities who asked whether he was funded by anti-Chinese foreign groups and pressured him to stop talking online.
""I told them I'll stop talking, but I'll continue to use VPN to get outside information for myself,"" Xu said in his basement gym in east Beijing. ""As a citizen of the People's Republic of China, I have a right to know about a huge incident like Hong Kong. You can't just hear one voice. When you hear only one voice, how do you know if it's real or fake?""'Blanket repression'
Snuffing out dissenting voices is a classic whack-a-mole strategy for a Beijing government concerned about the spread of destabilizing ideas across its southern border, said Jessica Chen Weiss, an expert on Chinese government and nationalism at Cornell University.
But Weiss noted an increasingly visible facet of the government's strategy: doubling down on propaganda and patriotic education to ""preempt"" critical views of the Communist Party.
""They want to create a frame of thought, to urge people to rally behind the government,"" she said. ""The Xi government is resorting to indoctrination and blanket repression.""Protests in Hong Kong show no signs of quieting down despite the government concession, and schools have become some of the epicenters. On Monday, the first day of the school year, Hong Kong high school students sang protest songs over the national anthem and boycotted class.

Meanwhile, in mainland China, millions of youths were shown a 90-minute back-to-school special on state television.
In online forums, Chinese parents lamented that their children were assigned homework about the program, which drilled into themes of patriotism, sacrifice and the sanctity of China's flag.The program conspicuously avoided any mention of Hong Kong, but it drove home its point with a final segment about Macao, a former Portuguese colony and semiautonomous territory that is often compared to Hong Kong.
A schoolgirl from Macao sang a ballad about her people's unbreakable loyalty to China despite its colonial past:
""You know 'Macao' was not my real family.
""I've been away from you, mother.
""What they plundered was my flesh.
""You still keep my soul.""

Shih reported from Beijing."
Trump's stance on Hong Kong protests fits a pattern,"President Trump's largely hands-off response to the violent clashes between pro-democracy protesters and authorities in Hong Kong fits a pattern: The president as bystander in chief, an onlooker to world events that previous leaders would almost certainly have decried as assaults on democracy or human rights.
Trump often deflects or plays down U.S. interest in events whose connection to the United States may not seem immediate, as he did this week with Hong Kong.
President Trump said Thursday that Chinese President Xi Jinping should meet with the protesters to resolve the standoff. He did not endorse the pro-democracy cause or warn China off a military crackdown.
""If President Xi would meet directly and personally with the protesters, there would be a happy and enlightened ending to the Hong Kong problem,"" Trump said in a tweet. ""I have no doubt!""
The post came one day after Trump tweeted that he had ""ZERO doubt"" that Xi could ""quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem"" if he wanted to.
China's government has recently likened the protests to U.S.-backed ""terrorism,"" and a meeting between Xi and the demonstrators is unlikely.
Earlier this week, thousands of protesters shut down Hong Kong's international airport, defying an intensifying police crackdown. But the protests were marred by late-night mob scenes, as demonstrators seized two men - one a reporter for Chinese state media, another they claimed to be a Chinese government agent - and clashed with police and paramedics who tried to evacuate the pair.
The episode marked a dramatic escalation after months of protests and marches by the demonstrators. They initially took to the streets in opposition to a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, but as fears of Beijing's erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy have grown, the scope of the protesters' demands has widened.
Trump has positioned himself firmly on the sidelines.
He has appealed for calm but did not lay out consequences if China acts against demonstrators, even as other political figures and the State Department did so, or refute the Chinese claims of a U.S. hand in protests.
""Many are blaming me, and the United States, for the problems going on in Hong Kong. I can't imagine why?"" Trump tweeted Tuesday.
The same day, Trump gave only implicit and offhand endorsement to the protesters' calls for liberty in the face of widening Chinese government control over the banking and commercial hub.
""The Hong Kong thing is a very tough situation. Very tough. We'll see what happens,"" Trump said when asked by a reporter Tuesday whether he urged China to show restraint. ""But I'm sure it'll work out. I hope it works out for everybody, including China, by the way. I hope it works out for everybody.""
Trump went on to call the bloody clashes ""a very tricky situation.""
""I hope it works out peacefully,"" he said. ""I hope nobody gets hurt. I hope nobody gets killed.""
Some of Trump's reluctance to take on Beijing seems linked to his ""America First"" belief that the United States should not be a global ""policeman,"" as he has put it. The president also has admired the breadth of power wielded by autocrats and rarely challenges them in public over human rights abuses.
In the case of Hong Kong, Trump's reaction may also be colored by his failure to secure a trade deal with China and concerns about the U.S. economy.
Trump accuses Beijing of balking and backsliding in trade negotiations, which remain at an impasse despite Trump's confidence earlier this year that his personal bond with Xi would pay off with a beneficial trade pact.
Trump's comments Tuesday about Hong Kong coincided with a potentially embarrassing about-face on tariffs Trump had pledged to impose next month. The White House said it would delay the penalties on Chinese imports of cellphones, laptop computers and other products until Dec. 15.
On Wednesday, as the stock market reeled, Trump claimed in a tweet that the United States is ""winning, big time, against China.""
He blamed the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, and not his own trade agenda, for any economic fallout. ""China is not our problem, though Hong Kong is not helping. Our problem is with the Fed. Raised too much & too fast. Now too slow to cut.""Asked Wednesday about criticism that Trump is pulling back from the traditional American role as a global defender of freedom, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross called the Hong Kong standoff ""an internal matter.""
CNBC host Joe Kernen pressed Ross about whether deadlocked trade negotiations are ""making it harder for us to do, to lead, in a way that we would have in the past.""
""I don't know that we would have done anything different in the past,"" Ross replied. ""What would we do, invade Hong Kong?""
Trump adopted a similarly nonconfrontational stance against Saudi Arabia after the killing of dissident columnist Jamal Khashoggi and the detention of women's rights activists, and against Russia for its continued detention of Ukrainian ships and sailors.
He initially resisted blaming Moscow for poisoning an ex-spy on British soil, writing off the 2018 attack as an unpleasant but remote event, even as close ally Britain appealed for solidarity from Washington. Trump later sided forcefully with Britain and imposed sanctions, but his first instinct to remain at arm's length alarmed British leaders and members of Congress of both parties.
Trump fails to see the ripple effect of a Chinese crackdown on Hong Kong or how Beijing would leverage license from the United States to pursue it, said Evelyn Farkas, a former senior Pentagon official in the Obama administration.
""He doesn't understand world history or the dynamics at work here, and he's probably not very interested,"" said Farkas, now a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. ""He was only made interested by the criticism of his silence.""
Retired Gen. Jack Keane, a Fox News analyst and Trump favorite, said the White House is failing to stand up for fundamental values.
""I think it's unfortunate that the president and his team hasn't spoken up very loudly in sympathy for the protesters,"" Keane said Tuesday on Fox Business.Trump's tone stood in contrast with more assertive statements from the State Department, which urged Beijing to respect Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms.
""We condemn violence and urge all sides to exercise restraint, but remain staunch in our support for freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly in Hong Kong,"" the State Department said.
The White House did not issue a formal statement about the rising unrest this week, and did not include Hong Kong among topics Trump discussed Monday in a phone call with new British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Hong Kong is a former British colony. The degree of autonomy accorded to Hong Kong when Britain negotiated terms of the territory's 1997 handover to China underlies the current crisis.
Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, was in Britain this week. He did not publicly raise the Hong Kong issue. And if Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took the Chinese government to task during a hastily arranged meeting in New York on Tuesday with China's top diplomat, both governments kept quiet about it.
""Director Yang Jiechi and Secretary Michael R. Pompeo had an extended exchange of views on U.S.-China relations,"" a statement from State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus read in its entirety.
A senior administration official noted that Trump has previously said Hong Kong demonstrators are ""looking for democracy and I think most people want democracy.""
""We urge all sides to remain calm, safe, and peaceful,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in keeping with diplomatic custom.
""Freedoms of expression and assembly are core values that we share with the people of Hong Kong and these freedoms should be protected. The United States firmly rejects the notion that we are sponsoring or inciting the demonstrations.""
Trump and his foreign affairs bureaucracy appeared to be moving in ""different orbits,"" said Richard Bush, a China expert at the Brookings Institution.
""What the State Department has said is consistent with what they say in any such situation,"" he said. ""Trump doesn't appear to think that such disturbances are any business of the United States. He places his emphasis on his personal relationship with Xi Jinping, for whom Hong Kong is a serious challenge.""
Lawmakers were quick to denounce China this week, and many Republicans went much farther than Trump. A Chinese government spokeswoman had criticized U.S. lawmakers for meddling and accused them of stirring up the protests.
""Images of Beijing-backed forces brutalizing civilians speak for themselves. Millions of Hong Kongers protesting the Chinese Communist Party's encroachment know the truth about exactly who is responsible for 'inciting' chaos. The rest of the world knows too,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) tweeted Wednesday.Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) appealed to Trump.
""The Administration must make clear to Beijing that any crackdown in Hong Kong will have profound consequences for China, including imposition of US sanctions, which was included in my amendment that passed the Senate as part of the National Defense Authorization Act,"" he wrote.But an executive branch rebuke carries far more weight than criticism from Congress, and greater potential for risk. China could flout a more explicit warning from Trump, leaving him looking weak, or could use a confrontation with Trump over Hong Kong as a reason to crater a trade deal.
Frank Gaffney, a conservative commentator and anti-Muslim activist who has been supportive of Trump, chided the president in a radio message Wednesday. Gaffney, a longtime China hawk, lamented that Trump is not joining the fray.
""Clearly, the President is tiptoeing through a minefield,"" Gaffney said, before warning that Trump will be judged harshly if he does not draw a clear line against tyranny.
""Mr. Trump will be widely blamed if he declined to deter such repression by establishing beforehand that it will entail high costs for China,"" Gaffney said. ""Mr. President: Do that now.""

Hong Kong protesters continue calls for full withdrawal of extradition bill,"Demonstrators surround police headquarters amid allegations of misconduct

HONG KONG - Thousands of demonstrators again blocked main city thoroughfares on Friday and, in a new show of displeasure, surrounded police headquarters, demanding that a deeply unpopular extradition bill be fully withdrawn by the city's leader and that police investigate cases of alleged police brutality.
For more than a week, enormous numbers of protesters have taken to the streets of the semiautonomous territory, calling for the scrapping of a bill that would allow for extraditions to China. The continued upheaval has placed Carrie Lam, the pro-Beijing chief executive, at the center of the most serious crisis of her political career.
Lam has suspended the bill and offered up two public apologies but has refused to withdraw the legislation completely. Her apologies have been dismissed as self-serving, and many continue to demand that she resign.
Some government offices downtown were closed Friday in anticipation of the rallies.
Friday's protests were originally organized, in part, by the student unions of Hong Kong universities but gathered support online and through messaging apps popular with younger demonstrators. Student leaders had given the government until 5 p.m. local time on Thursday to respond to a list of four demands or face new protests.
In addition to seeking the withdrawal of the bill and a police misconduct investigation, they also want charges against those arrested during past protests to be dropped and the retraction of references to the June 12 protest as a ""riot.""
So Tsun-Fung, the president of the student union of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said students were disappointed and angered by the government's response. ""We need to put more pressure on the government,"" he said.
Although some have questioned the wisdom of the latest protest, which comes less than a week after an estimated 2 million people took to the streets, So said they needed to maintain momentum. ""If we wait, it will be too late,"" he said.
Harcourt Road, a major motorway through Hong Kong's central district, has been a focus of past demonstrations, including last week's occupation that ended with police firing tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters.
On Friday, protesters again blocked the road, though the crowds were thinner than during previous closures. After speaking out on Lam, demonstrators are now directing their anger toward the police. In recent days, videos of officers arresting protesters and firing tear gas have been shared widely on social media, eliciting outrage.
Outside police headquarters, protesters pelted officers with eggs, which splattered on police riot shields.
Artwork depicting the police violently confronting protesters has popped up around the city, as have groups projecting videos of the incidents onto screens in public.

Sonia, 18, who spoke on the condition that only her first name be used, said she was frustrated with police dismissing the complaints of young people and telling them to submit their grievances by email.
""We are all very angry about it,"" she said. ""The people who the police hurt are young people and students. They are vulnerable citizens."" 
Like many in attendance, she had obscured her face with a dental mask.
Another protester, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely, said that while she understood police had a job to do, they acted in a ""totally unreasonable"" manner dispersing crowds on June 12. She cited a widely shared video showing a demonstrator being roughly apprehended by a group of about six officers.
Protesters taped photos of police firing tear gas and injured demonstrators to the police complex. Others blocked a police van in the road and pushed metal barricades against some doors to the building. A small group of protesters scaled the walls surrounding the police headquarters to cover surveillance cameras with tape or block them with opened umbrellas. 
With temperatures in the high 80s and stifling humidity, many took refuge in the shade of underpasses and stuck cooling patches to their foreheads. Officers stood in a line blocking the front door. One officer filmed protesters with a handheld camera.
The Hong Kong Police Force, which has previously defended its actions, said in a post on Twitter that the gathering would ""seriously affect the emergency services provided by police.""
The police force added in a statement Friday afternoon that it could not respond to about two dozen calls to the 999 emergency hotline because of the large crowd blocking roads. 
Joshua Wong, who rose to prominence as a leader of the 2014 Umbrella Movement and was just released from prison, addressed the crowd and called for Police Commissioner Stephen Lo to meet with protesters to hear their grievances.
Wong was absent from the mass demonstrations of the past month because he was serving a jail term for charges stemming from the 2014 protests, during which demonstrators paralyzed major roads in a 79-day occupation of central Hong Kong calling for universal voting to pick Hong Kong's leaders.

"Hong Kong protesters gird for fight, transform university into a fortress","Student pro-democracy demonstrators build defenses, prepare for showdown 


HONG KONG "" Behind a barricade made of bamboo scaffolding, desks and umbrellas, Damon naps in a truck tire next to a baseball bat.
At midday Thursday, the junk offers a bit of shade. The 17-year-old high school student "" dressed in black and wearing kneepads "" has barely slept since he moved onto the Chinese University campus. The tire leans against a car door, and he's not sure where either came from. 'I don't know, maybe that truck,' he says, gesturing to the scorched, toppled vehicle a short distance away. 

Two nights ago, the truck ignited when police besieged a bridge leading to the university, among Hong Kong's most prestigious colleges, provoking one of the fiercest clashes of the pro-democracy uprising. 
For six months, protesters have taken to the streets of the semiautonomous financial hub demanding more democracy and less Chinese encroachment. The movement assumed new urgency Tuesday night when police pummeled students with tear gas and rubber bullets, turning the Chinese University campus into a conflict zone as students fought back with gasoline bombs and bricks.
Since then, the campus has been usurped by students and volunteers, transforming it into a fortress. The bridge, which reeks of petroleum and burned rubber, has become an arsenal, equipped with a makeshift catapult, javelins, bows and arrows, and molotov cocktails. There are shopping carts stacked with bricks and boogie boards for use as shields. 
'They can deal with tear gas and rubber bullets,' says Jonathan, a 29-year-old graduate and a finance worker who, like Damon, gives only one name for fear of retribution. 'We don't have anything for real guns.'

Police have described the university "" in Hong Kong's northern reaches, about 14 miles from the central business district "" as a weapons factory. As protesters mill about the 340-acre campus, a day after classes were suspended, the atmosphere feels volatile. Exchange students preparing to leave the city drag suitcases down the barricaded access road. 
When sirens sound, everyone goes silent and looks for the source. 'Police?' exclaims Jonathan when he mishears a conversation about a nearby protest. 'No, no, Poly University,' comes a comrade's reply, referring to a campus where police fired tear gas at students on Thursday. 'Oh, okay.'
https://twitter.com/caseyquack/status/1194921200364843008?s=20"">
Between shifts hauling supplies to lecture halls and hammering bricks, hundreds hang around the graffiti-covered campus turned commune "" napping wherever they can, checking their phones, enjoying the respite. But as the hours tick by, there's a sense that things could flare again at any moment.
Hong Kong's government, urged on by Chinese leaders, has intensified a clampdown on protesters, who have responded to each uptick of force with a reciprocal escalation. A 70-year-old man died Thursday night after being hit with an object, thought to be a brick, during street clashes.
Unrest increased sharply this week after the police shooting of a protester and the death of another who fell from a parking garage as police dispersed crowds nearby. On Thursday, Hong Kong's government suspended all school classes through Sunday and said it would recruit correctional officers to reinforce police ranks.

The police raid at Chinese University has been a clarion call for other colleges to erect barricades. Protests flared Thursday at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and in the city's downtown area. 
The campus clashes have reinforced a growing sense that the next phase of the struggle will be centered on the city's classrooms.
This week, China's cabinet published an education policy document outlining revisions to promote loyalty to Beijing. The issue of patriotic education has been divisive in Hong Kong; parents and students took to the streets in 2012 to force the withdrawal of a proposal to introduce Chinese textbooks that appeared to criticize democracy and applaud the 'China model' of one-party rule.

The document released by China's cabinet did not give details but said a new, nationwide curriculum will 'consolidate the common ideological and political foundation,' boost support for the socialist system and the Communist Party of China, and 'guide' residents of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, as well as overseas Chinese, 'to enhance their national identity and consciously safeguard national and ethnic unity.'
On Thursday, the Nanchang Aviation University in southern China announced that it would 'severely handle' the case of a professor who expressed sympathy for Hong Kong protesters in a private messaging group.
At the Chinese University, protesters have maximized every resource to make the campus a perfect citadel. The first-aid team took over the gym: Nurses and volunteers man tables of creams and bandages while others sleep on the floor under space blankets. A whiteboard keeps track of injuries "" calf wound, eye injury, ankle sprain "" as well as who is on duty and emergency numbers. The outdoor track is the most popular sleeping quarters, although some protesters erect tents on the infield.


China has pressed Hong Kong officials to end the protests. Meanwhile, students are bracing for another possible attack.
Some here talk of 'June 4' "" a reference to the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, when China's ruling Communist Party gunned down hundreds, perhaps thousands, of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing.
'We can see the Chinese government and the Hong Kong police are trying to invade our school campus, our liberty, our future,' Damon says.

Shih reported from Beijing. Tiffany Liang in Hong Kong contributed to this report."
Protesters in Hong Kong sidestep state surveillance,"HONG KONG - The moment the 25-year-old protester got home from demonstrations that turned violent - tear gas still stinging her eyes - she knew what she had to do: delete all of her Chinese phone apps.
WeChat was gone. So was Alipay and the shopping app Taobao. She then installed a virtual private network on her smartphone to use with the secure messaging app Telegram in an attempt to stay hidden from cybermonitors.
""I'm just doing anything"" to stay ahead of police surveillance and hide her identity, said the protester. She asked to be referred to by only her first name, Alexa, to avoid drawing the attention of authorities amid the most serious groundswell against Chinese-directed rule in Hong Kong since 2014.
Protests that expanded over the past week against a bill allowing extraditions to China were marked by something unprecedented: a coordinated effort by demonstrators to leave no trace for authorities and their enhanced tracking systems.
Protesters used only secure digital messaging apps such as Telegram and otherwise went completely analogue in their movements: buying single-ride subway tickets instead of prepaid stored-value cards, forgoing credit cards and mobile payments in favor of cash and taking no selfies or photos of the chaos.
They wore face masks to obscure themselves from CCTV, fearing facial-recognition software, and bought fresh pay-as-you-go SIM cards.
Unlike the pro-democracy movement in 2014, the latest demonstrations have remained intentionally leaderless in another attempt to frustrate police, who have used tear gas and rubber bullets against the crowds.
On Saturday, Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam announced the suspension of the extradition bill, saying she hoped to return peace to the streets of the city. But the measure was not fully withdrawn, and Lam still expressed support.
Protesters, meanwhile, have called for another major show of defiance on the streets on Sunday.
Protests in surveillance age
Amid the chaos, Hong Kong has offered a picture of what it looks like to stage mass civil disobedience in the age of the surveillance state. 
""The Chinese government will do a lot of things to try to monitor their own people,"" said Bonnie Leung, a leader of the Hong Kong-based Civil Human Rights Front.
Leung cited media coverage of China's use of artificial intelligence to track individuals and its social-credit-score system.
""We believe that could happen to Hong Kong, too,"" she said.
The core of the protests is over the belief that Beijing - which was handed back control of the former British colony more than 20 years ago - is increasingly stripping Hong Kong of its cherished freedoms and autonomy.
The identity-masking efforts by protesters also reflect deep suspicions that lines between China and Hong Kong no longer exist - including close cooperation between Hong Kong police and their mainland counterparts, who have among the most advanced and intrusive surveillance systems.
""It is the fundamental reason people are protesting in the first place,"" said Antony Dapiran, who wrote a book on protest culture in Hong Kong. ""They don't trust Beijing, they don't trust their authorities and the legal system, and they don't like the blurring of lines between Beijing and Hong Kong.""
For many who had taken to the streets over the past week, the fight was a familiar one.
In 2014, protesters occupied Hong Kong's main arteries for 79 days, demanding full universal suffrage in the territory. Prominent student leaders and activists marshaled up support night after night in mini-cities set up on Hong Kong's thoroughfares, until they were eventually cleared out by police. 
All of the most prominent leaders of that movement - Joshua Wong, only a teenager at the time of the protests, legal scholar Benny Tai and Chan Kin-man, a sociology professor - are in jail.

'Much more cautious now'
The masses gathered around government buildings this past week were without clear leaders. Demonstrators shared protest tips and security measures with people they had met just hours before to avoid a similar fate. Meetups were primarily planned on Telegram, which became the top trending app on the iPhone app store in Hong Kong in the days leading up to the protest. 
""Information on personal safety was passed around on Telegram channels and group chats,"" said Caden, a 21-year-old Hong Kong student in Indiana who returned home early to participate. He was among an estimated 1 million who marched on June 7 to start the protest movement.
On the group chats, Caden received a barrage of advice that included changing his username on Telegram to sound nothing like his actual name, changing the phone number associated with the app and using SIM cards without a contract. 
""We are much more cautious now for sure than in 2014. Back then, it was still kind of rare for the police to arrest people through social media,"" Caden said, who did not give his full name for fear of retribution. ""All of this is definitely new for most people there."" 
Alexa noticed messages on Facebook, used by an older generation of Hong Kongers, warning people to mask their digital footprints. 
""People keep telling each other not to take pictures during the protest and only to take wide shots without people's faces on them,"" she said. 
It marked a huge change in sentiment for her, someone who had been attending peaceful demonstrations in Hong Kong with her family for years. 
""We'd always take pictures and upload them to Facebook and so on. It would tell people you are there at the scene,"" she said. ""But by now, everyone [has] equated the bill to cracking down on the Hong Kong legal system. We are all afraid that it won't exist anymore."" 
Hours before Wednesday's occupation of Hong Kong roads, Hong Kong police arrested Ivan Ip, a coordinator of a Telegram group with thousands of people, in his home. He is out on bail. 
Telegram also reported a massive cyberattack, which the company said probably originated from China and was timed with the protest. 
Samantha Hoffman, a fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute's Cyber Center, said data-collection methods used in China have been specifically designed to intimidate people from participating in demonstrations. She described the strategy as ""killing the root before the weed can grow.""
""It's a form of preemptive security,"" she said.
Still, researchers say it has been difficult to figure out the extent to which the Hong Kong Police Force cooperates with China on surveillance technology and tools.
'Electronic traces'
The Hong Kong force says it sends about 150 officials every year for ""ideological and practical"" training at elite mainland police academies. A larger number also receive regular training in ""hand-to-hand combat, interrogation skills, criminal investigation and gun use,"" according to news releases from the Chinese government. 
When a high-speed rail link connecting Beijing to Hong Kong opened, Chinese police were allowed to enforce mainland laws in the rail terminus. The rail link opened last year, marking the first time mainland police were allowed to patrol Hong Kong as part of joint immigration checks.
Maya Wang, a senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said there is ""very little transparency"" about the cooperation between Hong Kong police and mainland authorities.
Wang also noted that Hong Kong is moving ahead with plans for more ""smart city"" initiatives - with little clarity on which companies would be assisting them in that task. 
""People are concerned that their electronic traces can be collected and monitored as the city becomes more digitized,"" she said. ""What about the Chinese companies that are assisting or involved with the collection of data in Hong Kong? Would they be passing that data back?""
Alexa, Caden and other protesters interviewed by The Washington Post say they remain undeterred and will continue to show up at demonstrations. They have masks and goggles prepared, they say, both as a shield against police tactics such as the use of pepper spray and to avoid potential facial-recognition and other surveillance software.
""I do not think this is overly cautious. If we read books by George Orwell and we read histories about communist parties, of course this is not overly cautious,"" said Leung. 
""If I was not some sort of leader or coordinator of the Civil Human Rights Front, I may wear a face mask as well,"" she added. ""I can totally understand why people would want to hide their identities.""

"Amid standoff, some warn Hong Kong is losing its business appeal","HONG KONG - One after another, the Starbucks outlets in the Wan Chai district just east of central Hong Kong were smashed up. 
One, set on fire and vandalized just days before and boarded up, was splattered with fresh expletive-laden graffiti Sunday. The glass door on another was broken, the sharp tiny shards littering the sidewalk. The green logo of the twin-tailed mermaid on another store was defaced by black spray paint. 
Hong Kong's pro-democracy protesters have turned their anger toward businesses perceived as supportive of Beijing, with even American brands such as the Seattle-based global coffee chain and upscale burger joint Shake Shack becoming targets. It's not the corporations that are in the crosshairs but rather the local franchisee, Maxim's Group, which is detested for perceptions that it backs China over the pro-democracy protests.
The pressure, however, is arguably even more intense from the other side. Beijing has been hypervigilant about any local or international corporation that has expressed even a shred of sympathy for the protest movement.
Among the hardest hit has been Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways, where about three dozen employees have been fired for making comments perceived as supporting the pro-democracy demonstrators.
But jitters have spread beyond the city's borders, with shoe brand Vans, Spanish fashion house Zara and even the National Basketball Association getting caught between Hong Kong and Beijing. The mounting pressure from protesters and authorities in Beijing is exposing a harsh truth for Hong Kong. Its days as a Western-friendly global financial hub, perfectly positioned to access the lucrative Chinese market, appear numbered. Hong Kong's strong suit has become its weakness as companies get trapped on either side of a spiraling confrontation. 
""Hong Kong as Asia's world city is finished. There is no way that Hong Kong can recapture its reputation as an efficient, safe, well-governed, orderly place to live and work and do business anymore,"" said Mike Chinoy, a Hong Kong-based nonresident senior fellow at the University of Southern California's U.S.-China Institute. ""Some of this stuff you can't put back together."" 
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam acknowledged in a news conference Tuesday that Hong Kong's economy is being battered, saying that last quarter's economic data is likely to be ""very bad."" Goldman Sachs in a research note last week estimated that up to $4 billion in capital left Hong Kong for Singapore over the summer. 
Police said Tuesday that more than 200 cases of vandalism had occurred over the past four days, crimes that go ""beyond the freedom-of-speech argument"" and will be punished in accordance with the law.
Aside from MTR Corp., the subway operator considered now to be siding with authorities to suppress the protests, demonstrators have taken aim at the franchises operated by Maxim's Group, Chinese banks and chambers of commerce, and businesses run by the Fujian community, a group from a southeastern Chinese province that has suspected links to pro-Beijing organized crime.

Some have even created guides and fliers, disseminated online and plastered all over Hong Kong, instructing their fellow protesters about what to target - hoping to instill some discipline and counter the government narrative that they are indiscriminate rioters.
Using cute graphics featuring a cartoon pig, the leaflets describe why one business should be smashed up and another supported. They have apologized to those inadvertently targeted, such as an HSBC bank branch graffitied along with a Bank of China branch, and helped them clean up the mess.
U.S. brands such as Starbucks, which declined to comment for this article, are now being pushed to rethink their association with these Hong Kong businesses or risk their stores being routinely damaged and boycotted.
A statement from Maxim's said, ""we genuinely hope all parties will resolve their differences and our community may resume normal operations again soon.""
China's pressure has extended to global banks such as HSBC, Standard Chartered and BNP Paribas. The latter, a global French financial institution, distanced itself from bank lawyer Jason Ng after he posted a pro-democracy post criticizing pro-China supporters on Facebook late last month. He has since resigned.""It has become clear to me that I can no longer juggle my day job and my activism work,"" Ng wrote on Facebook. ""If I must pick one, I will always choose the latter and I did.""
Cathay Pacific became one of the earliest and most significant examples of how far Beijing's authority could reach into Hong Kong. 
After singling out the airline and its 20,000 Hong Kong-based staff members, China's aviation regulator forced an overhaul of policy at the company and barred those who had participated in protests from flying into or over the mainland. The chief executive, one of his deputies and the chairman have been replaced.
Once told that they would never be penalized for their political leanings, union representatives as well as current and former Cathay employees say a purge has begun, resulting in the firing of more than 30 employees thought to have even mild protest sympathies.
The Washington Post spoke to more than half a dozen former employees of Cathay Pacific and its regional arm, Cathay Dragon, who told nearly identical stories of abrupt firings after they were confronted by superiors with printouts of their private social media accounts and conversations in encrypted message groups. In an emailed response to questions, a spokesman for Cathay Pacific said the company ""fully supports the upholding of the Basic Law,"" referring to the framework that gives Hong Kong significant autonomy from China, but said the company also has to comply with regulations in all jurisdictions to which it flies.

Hong Kong leader caught between her people and Beijing,"HONG KONG - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has always known the importance of keeping Beijing happy.
Speaking last October, on the anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Lam passionately called for ""national unity"" between the former British colony and the mainland.
She stressed that Hong Kong and China are ""one country"" - de-emphasizing the ""two systems"" framework that guarantees her territory significant autonomy. She went on to reference the words of Chinese President Xi Jinping. 
""President Xi Jinping clearly reminded us that it is imperative to have a correct understanding of the relationship between 'one country' and 'two systems,' "" Lam said. ""He said one country is like the roots of a tree. For a tree to grow tall and luxuriant, its roots must run deep and strong."" 
This is just what China's leaders want to hear from the handpicked chief executive in Hong Kong.
But the waves of pro-autonomy protests in Hong Kong have severely tested Lam's political usefulness with Beijing - and underscores a core tension for Hong Kong's overseers since the territory was returned to Chinese control 22 years ago.
How can you please both Beijing's hard-line views and Hong Kong's pro-democracy demands? Or as Kenneth Chan, a former pro-democracy lawmaker and a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, called it: Hong Kong's ""two masters.""
Lam is now stuck in the middle - a symbol of the competing pressures on Hong Kong at a pivotal moment that could shape the political course of the territory for years to come.Protesters - angered over a proposal to allow extraditions to the mainland - have increasingly called on Lam to step down amid sweeping rallies over the past weeks that have brought millions of people into the streets.
Chinese authorities, meanwhile, are dismayed by the upheavals and fear that Lam has become so politically damaged that she can no longer advance their goals in the semiautonomous territory, according to analysts and others involved in Chinese affairs.
""I would say [Chinese officials] are quite angry,"" said Michael Tien, a pro-establishment legislator and business magnate who is also one of the Hong Kong deputies to China's National People's Congress.""They are most furious [at] the [government's] misjudgment of the acceptance of the bill, and the misjudgment of the reaction of the public,"" Tien added.
Steve Tsang, the director of SOAS University of London's China Institute and an author of several books on Hong Kong's government, said Lam's unraveling ""is truly extraordinary."" 
""She has proven herself to be incompetent. She has proven herself to be a serious embarrassment and she has proven herself to be a liability,"" he said. ""The Communist Party does not forget and is not very forgiving. She's finished as chief executive of Hong Kong.""
There is no sign of Lam bowing out. She tried to ease the protests by pledging to put the extradition bill on hold, and is ready to ""accept"" the possibility that the bill is likely to die. But she also did not withdraw it.
The huge opposition ""obviously touched a raw nerve for people in Beijing,"" said Ronny Tong, a legal adviser to Lam who led a delegation to the mainland in May. 
Tien, the pro-establishment lawmaker, said that Beijing believed they were ""misled from day one that it was just a small opposition to the [extradition bill]."" 
""The first Sunday protest changed all of that,"" he said. ""They started thinking, what the hell is going on?""
Nothing has been easy about running Hong Kong.
Tung Chee-hwa, a shipping tycoon, was the first person to hold the position and resigned in 2005 in part due to mass demonstrations against a sedition legislation that those in Hong Kong feared would end free speech and other rights.
He was replaced by Donald Tsang, a career civil servant with a fondness for bow ties. The final months of his seven-year tenure were clouded by allegations of kickbacks from business magnates. He was later arrested, found guilty of misconduct and spent 12 months in jail. 
Tsang's successor, C.Y. Leung, rose to international prominence as the scowling, hard-line foil to the student leaders of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, a 79-day sit-in protesting against Beijing's involvement in the selection of the city's chief executive. He stunned Hong Kong political watchers by declining to run for the office again in 2016. 
Lam finds herself in an even more tenuous position. 
Since her selection as Hong Kong's leader in 2017, she has overseen the completion or furthering of a number of initiatives that served China's interests - a high-speed rail connecting Beijing to Hong Kong and a sea-and-tunnel crossing that links Hong Kong to the mainland by road.
Under her watch, Hong Kong expelled a foreign journalist and charged and jailed leaders of the 2014 protests. 
She had been pushing for even more laws that would have pleased Beijing, including one that would criminalize mockery of the Chinese national anthem.
Several Hong Kong government officials say it was Beijing that eventually pushed Lam to back away from the extradition proposals, especially after violence broke out on Hong Kong's streets. 
But the anger has not quelled. Thousands of protesters gathered again outside government offices and police headquarters Friday, calling for Lam to fully withdraw the bill as one of their four demands to the government. Lam has only been willing to put the bill on hold. Now, even less controversial proposals, such as the national anthem bill, are postponed. Some pro-establishment lawmakers worry their political futures are at risk, and clashed with Lam in a meeting on June 15, before she announced the bill's suspension. 
""Everybody suffered, everyone is paying a dear price,"" Tien said. ""I don't think [Lam] can finish this term unless she completely stays away from controversial issues.""
Shen Dingli, a professor at Fudan University's Institute of International Studies in Shanghai, said Lam still has some utility to offer Beijing, even as she needs to become better at ""predicting the risks of any major undertakings."" 
""She is still expected to quiet the turbulence in Hong Kong,"" Shen said. ""Replacing her has the disadvantage of encouraging the opposition."" 
China cannot afford and does not want million-strong political rallies on its doorstep, and has gone to great lengths to ensure that news of the Hong Kong protests does not reach its people. 
Chinese Internet users have posted claims on social media that their government is deleting references to and photos of Hong Kong protests on apps such as WeChat and Weibo. To get around such censorship, users started using more oblique references - referencing a Cantonese pop song, ""Queen's Road East,"" that makes reference to the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China.
But that song was pulled from music streaming services in China. A Washington Post search of the song's name on the streaming services QQ Music, Xiami, Kugou, and NetEase Cloud Music returned no results Thursday. In addition, ""Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies,"" a song by the Hong Kong rock band Beyond that became an unofficial anthem to the Umbrella Movement in 2014, also appeared to have been removed from Chinese music streaming sites.
Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on Wednesday, in the first public comments made by a top Chinese official since the protests, said the Chinese central government has ""formally expressed our support, understanding and respect"" for Lam's decision to postpone the extradition bill. 
But, he claimed, unnamed Western forces are ""taking advantage of this issue to stir up trouble.""
""You must withdraw your black hand,"" he said. ""Hong Kong is China's domestic affair."" 
In Hong Kong, though, distrust of the chief executive position as ""political puppets"" runs deep, said Chan, the professor at Hong Kong Baptist University. 
Even if Lam stepped aside, it would be unlikely that anyone could win back the trust of the Hong Kong public, he added.
""More and more,"" Chan said, ""people see that the chief executive is there to implement integration and assimilation of Hong Kong - from politics to business to infrastructure.""

"Hong Kong protesters outmaneuver police, vandalize Chinese liaison office","HONG KONG - Protesters occupied a significant swath of the city center for hours on Sunday, defacing and vandalizing the Chinese government's liaison office in a new provocation aimed at Beijing, before police pushed them back with rounds of tear gas and projectiles.
Elsewhere in Hong Kong, a small pro-Beijing mob attacked protesters with bats and sticks at a subway station, a new development in the chaos churning here in the seventh consecutive week of demonstrations.
Sunday's protest began as a peaceful march organized by the Civil Human Rights Front aimed once again at getting Hong Kong's government to fully withdraw a controversial extradition bill, among other demands. The group has organized some of the largest of the recent marches, including the June demonstration that brought nearly 2 million into the streets. Organizers estimated that 430,000 people showed up this time, defying police warnings of potential violence and exhortations to disperse at the end of a short approved route.
Police altered the route to keep protesters away from central Hong Kong and government buildings in the Admiralty district. They erected large water-filled barriers around the legislature, a focus of past protests, and glued bricks to the ground to prevent their use as makeshift weapons.
But much of the effort proved to be in vain as the protesters bypassed their usual targets and focused instead for a time on the Chinese government liaison office, the greatest symbol of Beijing's rising influence on the semiautonomous territory, and covered it in graffiti. They pelted the building with eggs and spray-painted graffiti calling Chinese President Xi Jinping a ""dog,"" but they did not try to enter.
The Hong Kong government said it ""strongly condemns the protesters who blatantly challenged the national sovereignty by maliciously besieging and storming the [Chinese government liaison] building as well as defacing the national emblem.""
The government said in a statement that such acts threaten ""law and order"" and the ""one country, two systems"" framework that gives Hong Kong a degree of autonomy from China.Protesters spread out across central parts of the island, making it difficult for officers to swiftly clear them off roads. Metal road dividers, road signs and construction materials were pulled from throughout the city and turned into makeshift weapons. 
""We have been fighting for quite a while, so we know what to do,"" said a 22-year-old demonstrator in a gas mask who declined to give his name for fear of arrest. ""Protesters have upgraded our defenses, using shields and sticks. Everyone has geared up.""
Around 10:15 p.m., police began firing tear gas at protesters near a ferry terminal that connects Hong Kong to Macao. The roads were largely cleared by midnight.
Earlier Sunday, a group of protesters broke police lines and headed down streets that were not authorized for their march. Main thoroughfares again turned into encampments for protesters, who stopped to rest on cement road barricades and overpasses.
Police issued repeated warnings for protesters to disperse, even suggesting specific public transportation routes, but many demonstrators continued on.
""There's an 'arrest me, fight me' kind of attitude,"" said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy legislator who took part in the march.
Demonstrators again used social media and other online tools to keep tabs on police activity. They shared locations of police barricades and heavy security on Telegram, a messaging app that has been popular throughout the protests, and used interactive Google maps to indicate first aid and water points.
It was the seventh consecutive weekend of demonstrations in Hong Kong. On Saturday, police said they arrested a man suspected of stashing ""extremely powerful"" homemade explosives in a warehouse. The 27-year-old was part of a group that advocates Hong Kong independence. 
Police said they also found acid, knives and metal rods at the warehouse.
Authorities have warned that hundreds of arrests related to earlier protests are imminent.
On Sunday in Yuen Long, a part of the city near the overland border with China, a small pro-Beijing group entered the subway station and pummeled protesters with sticks and bats, along with a local journalist live-streaming the incident. Trains were forced to skip the station, and there was blood on the floor.

The weeks-long upheaval was sparked by a proposal that would allow extraditions to China, but it has since swelled into a broader movement pushing for greater autonomy for Hong Kong in the face of a more assertive Beijing.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has characterized the extradition proposal as ""dead"" but has stopped short of fully withdrawing it from the legislature. She has not heeded protesters' demand that an independent commission investigate police action during the demonstrations. 
Analysts say Lam's government faces mounting pressure to find a political solution as Beijing grows increasingly impatient with the protests and growing calls for universal suffrage and other pro-democracy reforms. Hong Kong's leader is not elected directly, but chosen by a small committee from a pool of candidates screened by Beijing.
Predictions that the protest momentum would die down have yet to prove accurate, and demonstrations have continued weekend after weekend. 
Last week, thousands of elderly Hong Kongers, some in wheelchairs, some in walkers, showed up in support of the generally younger crowd that has led the marches on Sundays. As riot police readied tear gas, elderly women were on the front lines preparing to hand flowers to the officers and protesters.

"Police use tear gas, rubber bullets in Hong Kong protest","Demonstrators fill streets over extradition bill; final vote expected by June 20
HONG KONG - Hong Kong descended into scenes of crackdowns and defiance Wednesday as demonstrators occupied main boulevards and faced down tear gas and rubber bullets in a widening crisis over a bill that would allow extraditions to China. 
The unfolding images across the global financial hub - violent street battles, drivers abandoning vehicles and blocking roads in a show of solidarity - suggested both sides were digging in during another potentially pivotal moment for the former British colony.
For the protesters, the extradition plan amounts to the latest erosion of Hong Kong's freedoms and special status more than two decades after returning to Chinese control. Critics fear that it would effectively bring China's justice system - and its harsh rules against dissent - to the semiautonomous enclave.
Hong Kong's administration, meanwhile, is packed with pro-Beijing officials who appear intent on pushing through the measure. Amid the chaos, however, the legislature postponed a scheduled second reading of the bill. A final vote is expected by June 20.
Some demonstrators had come prepared with umbrellas, harking back to the 2014 Umbrella Movement pro-democracy protests in which young demonstrators had to shield themselves from police pepper spray.
Those protesters five years ago occupied the streets for 79 days, calling for a greater voice in selecting Hong Kong's leadership - demands that were not met. The extradition bill has re-energized residents and galvanized a wide cross-section of Hong Kong.
""We are trying to tell the government that the more they suppress us, the more we will fight back,"" said Justin Tang, 25, an airline employee who was sitting on a road that would normally be filled with Hong Kong's red-and-white taxis and transit buses.
""Being the last city in China that is able to do that, we are going to hold on to that right,"" he said.
And though the protests apparently delayed a reading of the bill, Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam on Wednesday insisted the law would be pushed through. That left questions as to the next steps on both sides.
The Hong Kong Police Force said as of Wednesday night it did not have the exact number of arrests. An unconfirmed number of people also suffered injuries from police-fired rubber bullets, bean bag rounds and tear gas.
Local news reports, citing hospital figures, said 72 people were injured by police-fired rubber bullets and tear gas, including a van driver from public broadcaster RTHK who was shot in the head. The reports could not be independently verified.The unrest weighed on markets. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended the day down 1.7 percent. The political fallout also expanded.
Britain's foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, urged the Hong Kong administration to ""pause and reflect"" on the extradition bill. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus took a jab at Beijing. The protesters, she said, ""don't like being subjugated . . . as it relates to some of their fundamental rights.""
Since Sunday - when hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets - the demonstrators have grown increasingly confrontational.
Throughout the day, the protesters - some wearing goggles and yellow construction helmets - pushed against police lines to force them back. Police eventually deployed tear gas, rubber bullets and batons.
""Police reiterate that any acts endangering public order and public safety will not be tolerated,"" the Hong Kong Police Force said in a statement. ""Police will take resolute actions to restore social order and protect public safety.""
At one point, a group of protesters streamed onto major roads near Hong Kong's main government offices, the Legislative Council complex. Demonstrators removed metal barricades, commandeering them to block key intersections and expressway ramps. Other barricades were used as makeshift ladders to assist people climbing over large concrete road dividers.
Hong Kong's Harcourt Road, a major thoroughfare tying the city together, erupted into anarchy in the afternoon, until the rally was briefly dispersed and pushed back to central areas of the city. 
At nightfall, the area around the legislature was deserted, but protests flared elsewhere in central Hong Kong, occupying some of the city's most well-known areas. Thousands of people walked the car-free streets.
Riot police remained stationed across the city. On the sidewalks, demonstrators stockpiled supplies preparing for what appeared to be a lengthy occupation. Drivers jackknifed their cars across main roads to halt traffic; a Tesla sports car blocked the entrance to a tunnel. 
The government has refused to scrap the extradition bill even after an enormous protest over the weekend, which organizers said brought more than 1 million people into the streets.
Hong Kong chief executive Lam said in a television interview Wednesday that she ""never had self-doubt because of this issue"" and would continue to pursue it.
She compared young protesters to a child who is given too much leniency by his mother and then indulges in headstrong behavior.
""He will feel regret: 'Why was my mother not tough with me?' "" she said, criticizing herself for being too tolerant with the protesters.
Lam appeared to grow emotional when asked to respond to claims that she had ""sold out"" Hong Kong.
""I was born here, raised here like every other Hong Konger. For my love of this place I have made no small amount of sacrifices,"" she said.China's central government ""will continue to support"" Hong Kong's government in passing the extradition law, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a news briefing in Beijing on Wednesday.
Any actions that harm Hong Kong are opposed by mainstream Hong Kong public opinion, Geng said, and he urged the United States to speak and act with caution regarding Hong Kong.
""We all, myself included, we underestimated people power in Hong Kong,"" pro-democracy lawmaker Claudia Mo told protesters. ""We in particular underestimated the young people power,"" she added, calling on Lam to drop the extradition bill.Protesters who spoke to The Washington Post said they felt better prepared and more organized than in 2014, despite the long odds of changing the government's position. Demonstrators quickly established points to distribute water, gloves, helmets, surgical masks and boxes of milk tea. 
People arriving with crates of supplies were met with cheers and applause.
Others helped to dress their fellow protesters' arms in plastic wrap - makeshift protection against the possibility of irritating pepper spray. Demonstrators cleared a path to allow first-aid workers to move quickly through the throngs of people. Police fired tear gas grenades at protesters, who ran toward the smoking projectiles to quickly douse them with water and put them out. 
Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997 after more than a century of British colonial rule. Under the handover agreement, China promised that the territory would remain politically independent, able to enact its own laws, and would keep its judicial and immigration systems and its economic framework.
But the territory's autonomy has been eroding at a hastening pace for years, and critics say the extradition measure could be the final nail in the coffin: the effective end of the ""one country, two systems"" framework, by extending mainland law into Hong Kong. The extradition bill would allow fugitives to be repatriated to countries with which Hong Kong does not have an extradition agreement, including China.
Conrad Wu was one of the first business owners to announce he would be shutting down. The owner of Call4Van, a moving-van-hailing service with about 300 drivers, Wu said he was frustrated with the government's insistence on pushing ahead with the bill after the march Sunday.
""The response we received was, 'I don't give a damn,' "" he said.
Tang, the airline worker, said he was not surprised by the government's refusal to back down but was still angered by it.
""The reaction is what we expected because Carrie Lam is not elected by the people and is just a puppet of Beijing,"" he said. ""It makes you really wonder who runs the Hong Kong government. Is it Hong Kong or is it Beijing?""

Apple pulls app used by Hong Kong protesters,"Chinese state media had accused U.S. tech giant of enabling demonstrators
HONG KONG - In the space of a week, Apple made a trio of changes to its phone software in Hong Kong that pleased the Chinese government but irked human rights advocates.
First, it removed the emoji for the flag of Taiwan, which China doesn't recognize, from its operating system. Then, it banned media outlet Quartz, which had offered readers detailed accounts of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. And on Wednesday night, it banned the HKmap.live app, which identified police locations, offering protesters a way to avoid the violent crackdowns underway.
It was Apple's second reversal on HKmap.live, which it initially rejected and then allowed to appear in its App Store. The latest about-face came after the People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, said in a blog post this week that the app had ""betrayed the feelings of the Chinese people."" The article accused the app's anonymous developer of harboring malicious motives and queried whether Apple was an accomplice of ""rioters.""
Removing the HKmap.live app ""is just the latest incident of Apple caving to the Chinese government's political pressure,"" said Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Hong Kong's Beijing-backed authorities have intensified a crackdown on demonstrators, who have taken to the streets to push for democracy and oppose Beijing's tightening grip on the semiautonomous financial hub. The unrest has become increasingly violent in recent weeks, posing the most direct challenge to the rule of Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
Apple, which depends on access to cheap labor in China to manufacture its devices, has a long history of capitulating to the Communist Party there. In 2017, it removed virtual private networks, which allowed Chinese citizens to freely use the Internet, from its App Store in China. That same year, it removed the New York Times app at the request of the government. In 2018, it moved Chinese citizens' iCloud accounts from U.S. servers to Chinese ones, giving the government there easier access to the data. Apple has said it is simply complying with local laws.
Apple's move comes as U.S. businesses find themselves under pressure from China's government over actions or statements perceived as contrary to the narrative of the ruling Communist Party. The pressure is particularly acute when it involves sensitive political issues such as the Hong Kong demonstrations. 
In recent days, the National Basketball Association found itself the target of a furious nationalist backlash from Beijing after Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of the Hong Kong protesters. Blizzard Entertainment, meanwhile, suspended a professional gamer for a year for reportedly shouting ""Liberate Hong Kong!"" during an interview. Chinese tech giant Tencent owns a 5 percent stake in Blizzard's parent company, Activision Blizzard. 
The tension has highlighted some U.S. firms' dependence on China while raising questions about their willingness to compromise on values such as freedom of expression to continue doing business in the country, where authorities tolerate no criticism of the ruling party. The experience also has shown the Chinese government's preparedness to punish foreign companies that don't toe its line.
In Hong Kong, other U.S. companies have found themselves on the opposite side of the coin. Starbucks outlets have been targeted by pro-democracy demonstrators because the Seattle-based chain's local franchisee, Maxim's, is seen as backing the Chinese government's stance against the protests.
Hong Kong police didn't respond immediately to a request for comment Thursday about their purported role in the HKmap.live app's removal.
The app used crowdsourced information to publicize the locations of riot police, traffic disruptions, deployment of tear gas and other incidents related to the protests.
In a statement late Wednesday, Apple spokesman Fred Sainz said the company was contacted by ""many concerned customers in Hong Kong"" about the app. It investigated immediately and then ""verified"" with the Hong Kong police that the app had been used to ""target and ambush police"" and threaten public safety, adding that the program violated its rules.
Sainz declined to answer exactly what the customers in Hong Kong were concerned about, or whether the police offered any evidence of a crime being committed.
Wang, of Human Rights Watch, said Apple's statement was ""rather disingenuous,"" because the Hong Kong police ultimately take orders from Beijing, she said. ""We all know the Hong Kong government is not independent of the Chinese government. The reason Apple did it is because Apple has so much financial interest in China."" 
Sainz declined to comment on whether any evidence was provided by the Hong Kong police.
To be sure, some protesters have resorted to violence in Hong Kong, but Wang said that it was somewhat laughable to think anyone would need an app to find police to ambush. Police can be found in Hong Kong by simple going out to dinner, she said. On the other hand, peaceful protesters are facing violent crackdowns from police, she said, giving them good reason to try to avoid them.
In a statement on Twitter on Thursday, the app's developer said there was no evidence that it had been used to target police or threaten public safety. It stressed that moderators deleted comments that encouraged criminal activity.
Apple's move, it said, was ""clearly a political decision"" designed to suppress freedom and human rights in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong,"The massive protests in Hong Kong caught officials there by surprise and startled the mainland. Even after Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's Beijing-anointed chief executive, apologized and said she would shelve her widely reviled extradition bill, demonstrators promised to continue protesting until the bill is formally withdrawn and Lam resigns.
It's possible that Beijing's leaders don't really understand Hong Kong and that Hong Kong's China-friendly leaders don't understand their own people. But here are five myths about the territory that are common in the West. 
Myth No. 1
Hong Kong is protesting to protect its democracy.
""Hong Kong's Massive Protests May Be Chinese Democracy's Last Stand,"" blared one headline in Slate. A Taiwanese newspaper warned, ""The erosion of democracy in Hong Kong offers a stark warning for Taiwan."" A bipartisan bill in Congress, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, ""reaffirms the U.S. commitment to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law"" in the territory.

But while its citizens enjoy a broad array of personal liberties and rights, Hong Kong has never been a democracy. It was for 150 years a British colony, run by an appointed British governor who reported to London. In the 1960s and '70s, when Britain considered introducing direct elections, Communist China squashed the idea, warning Britain to ""preserve the colonial status of Hong Kong."" Direct elections were later allowed, but only for a limited number of seats in the local legislature in 1991,
with the countdown ticking to Hong Kong's return to China. The last British governor, Chris Patten, expanded the number of directly elected council seats, but an infuriated China considered that a breach of the handover agreement and immediately replaced that legislature with an appointed one after resuming sovereignty.

Today, only half the 70 seats on the legislative council are directly elected by the public. The other half are chosen by ""functional constituencies"" - professional groups including engineers, teachers, lawyers, architects and accountants. Those seats are mostly filled with Beijing loyalists. The legislature is in any case relatively weak, with real power resting with the chief executive, who is appointed by a carefully chosen ""selection committee"" of 1,200 members heavily stacked with Beijing-friendly local figures. Candidates for chief executive are vetted in advance by Beijing to ensure their loyalty. China has repeatedly rejected demands from Hong Kong citizens for universal suffrage and the right to freely elect their top leader.
Myth No. 2
Hong Kong is a free-market bastion.

The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom has for the past 25 years crowned Hong Kong as the world's freest economy. Forbes lists it as the third-best country for business, noting its ""free market economy"" and lauding the territory for lacking tariffs on imports and for imposing excise taxes on only four commodities. Hong Kong officials, such as Finance Minister Paul Chan Mo-po,
tout those rankings
.
And it's true that taxes are low, it is mostly a free port, and doing business is easy. 
But Hong Kong's economy can't be called truly free while major sectors remain uncompetitive and controlled by local monopolies. A handful of wealthy tycoons and their families, most of whom made vast fortunes in real estate, moved into dominant roles in utilities and retail, often keeping out upstarts. The sprawling empire of Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's wealthiest man, includes chains of supermarkets, drugstores and appliance stores. Rival conglomerate Jardines owns the other big grocery and drugstore chains. Li's son Richard Li controls Now TV, which has a virtual monopoly on paid television services, offering 197 channels. Hong Kong has no laws against price-setting or anti-competitive behavior.
Hong Kong also has a large government sector that keeps a heavier hand in the economy than outsiders may suspect. For example, the government tightly controls the supply of available land, which keeps property prices high - some say artificially so.Myth No. 3
Hong Kong is economically vital to China.
At the time of the handover two decades ago, it was said that China would never kill the goose that lays the golden egg. More recently, ""Why Hong Kong remains vital to China's economy"" was a headline on a 2014 explainer in the Economist. ""Hong Kong remains a vital business link to China,"" the Singapore Straits Times newspaper said in 2017
. And after the protests this month, the Nikkei Asian Review ran an opinion piece under the headline ""China risks killing the Hong Kong golden goose.""

That analysis was true in 1997, when China took possession of a territory that accounted for about 16 percent
of its gross domestic product. But China's economy has exploded over the past two decades. Today, Hong Kong accounts for just 3 percent of China's economy.
Shanghai, Shenzhen and Ningbo-Zhoushan now all have bigger ports than Hong Kong does. Chinese ""red chip"" companies are bypassing Hong Kong to list on the New York Stock Exchange. Foreign firms doing business in China base their employees on the mainland and no longer have to rely on Hong Kong for representative offices.

Economically speaking, Hong Kong is now more dependent on China. Visitors from the mainland prop up its
tourism and retail sectors. Hong Kong universities depend on mainland students to keep their numbers up. Businesses hire Chinese graduates in Hong Kong for their Mandarin language skills and knowledge of the mainland.Myth No. 4
Hongkongers dislike mainland Chinese.
A Google search reveals many stories about conflicts between Hongkongers and their mainland cousins. Mainlanders are accused of a range of bad behavior, from buying out store shelves to acting rudely to packing subways and buses, often with oversize suitcases (full of shopping to take home).
Hongkongers feel inundated by the sheer numbers crossing the border, fearing the erosion of their language, Cantonese, and what they call the ""mainlandization"" of Hong Kong.
But Hong Kong and the mainland are closely intertwined, not just economically but within families, too. Most Chinese residents of Hong Kong trace their roots to the mainland, and many still have family there and make regular trips. Plenty of people do business on the mainland and travel back and forth. There are many cross-border marriages. Shopkeepers complain when the number of mainland tourists visiting over long holiday periods dips. Young people watch mainland Chinese films, soap operas and television shows. Hongkongers are also becoming increasingly bilingual with Cantonese and Mandarin. Pro-democracy Hongkongers may dislike the Chinese communist system - but not necessarily mainland Chinese people.

Myth No. 5
Hongkongers wanted to stay British.
A common view since 1997 has been that this scrappy little free and open place was handed over unwillingly to an oppressive communist regime and that the British abandoned Hongkongers to their unwanted fate. ""Anti-imperialists in the West failed to realize that to many Hong Kongers, being a British subject was preferable to being a subject of the Chinese Communist Party,"" said an article this month in Foreign Policy magazine. A headline in Newsweek two years ago asked, ""Did Britain abandon Hong Kong to the Chinese?""

Hongkongers had no choice about going back to China. But
opinions on the handover were more favorable than not.
Many locals were excited to see the end of British colonial rule and were enthusiastic about being reunited with China - particularly when told that Hong Kong's separate system would remain unchanged for at least 50 years. In the month before the June 1997 handover, a University of Hong Kong poll showed that 35 percent of residents were positive about it and 48 percent were neutral, with just 9 percent feeling negatively.
The souring on China came afterward, and can be directly attributed to the belief that Beijing was reneging on its commitments and trying to curtail Hong Kong's freedoms. In 2017, 20 years after the handover, a University of Hong Kong poll found that only 3.1 percent of young people between the ages of 18 and 29 said they were proud to identify as ""broadly Chinese."" As recently as 2008, that figure was nearly 40 percent.
China's own actions have generated the current hostility.

Mainland Chinese student among first to be convicted over demonstrations in Hong Kong,"First mainlander charged with offense related to unrest in Hong Kong


HONG KONG - A 24-year-old mainland Chinese music student living in Hong Kong on Thursday became among the first to be convicted on a charge related to the months-long protests in the city, receiving six weeks in prison for carrying an expandable baton. 
The student, Chen Zimou, is also the first mainland Chinese person to be charged with a protest-related offense - a reality that has put him and his family under intense pressure from Chinese authorities and Chinese nationalists online who have branded him a traitor. 
Although Chen pleaded guilty to carrying the weapon, he has maintained that he was not actively participating in protests when he was arrested. He also said in an interview that he did not realize the baton, which extends to about 30 inches, is illegal in Hong Kong. Similar batons are legal in mainland China.
Chen, a music major at the University of Hong Kong and a part-time piano teacher, told The Washington Post in an earlier interview that he was on his way home in the neighborhood of Sheung Wan on July 28 when he ran into a large group of protesters occupying roads near Beijing's liaison office in the city. 
He approached police officers to let him through their cordon to get home, he said, but was stopped and searched instead. When riot police officers found the baton, they arrested him.
""I thought it had to be a mistake, or maybe they were confused and thought I was a protester,"" said Chen, who admitted he was wearing black at the time - the color of Hong Kong's political protesters - but he said he was just trying to get home. ""I tried to explain."" 
Chen said he had bought the baton on the Chinese e-commerce website Taobao and picked it up in Shenzhen, the Chinese city that borders Hong Kong, where he teaches private piano lessons. Spooked by gang attacks against protesters and commuters at the Yuen Long subway station on July 21, Chen said he believed he needed something for his own ""self-defense."" He said he had already been assaulted once in the past year. 
More than 3,000 people have been arrested since protests began over an unpopular government proposal that would allow extraditions to mainland China. Although the bill has been withdrawn, demonstrations have tapped into long-held sentiments in Hong Kong that the city's autonomy is being eroded by Beijing and have revived a call for direct elections. 
Of those arrested, however, only a few hundred have been charged. Cases from earlier in the summer are still making their way through Hong Kong's judicial system, which lawyers say is under great strain over the huge number of detentions and mass arrests as a crackdown on the protest movement intensifies. A small number have been convicted of offenses, including a 16-year-old also found guilty on Thursday of possessing an offensive weapon - in this case, a laser pointer. 
As political tensions deepen, mainland Chinese students, residents and tourists in Hong Kong have often found themselves caught in between - sometimes targeted by - Hong Kong protesters who believe them to be against their cause and at other times threatened by mainland authorities for even mild protest sympathies.

Hong Kong officials arrest prominent movement leaders,"HONG KONG - Authorities widened crackdowns against Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement Friday, arresting prominent activists and lawmakers while warning that riot police would use force against protesters defying orders to stay off the streets.

The detentions attempted to strike at the heart of the demonstrations and underscored the increasing frustration among officials over the resilience of Hong Kong's marches and rallies that began this past spring.
But protesters did not appear shaken.
Authorities banned a march planned for Saturday and warned they would use force and possibly arrest those who ignore the order. Still, demonstrators are expected to return to the streets in a direct challenge to authorities.
The arrests Friday included Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow, who rose to eminence as the student leaders of pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014.
More than a dozen people have been arrested since Thursday. Among them were Andy Chan, the leader of a banned pro-independence party, and pro-democracy lawmakers and local representatives.
Police said Wong and Chow face charges of participating in an unauthorized assembly and inciting others to participate in an unapproved assembly, while Wong faces an additional charge of organizing an unapproved assembly, in relation to a June 21 protest at police headquarters. Both were released on bail Friday.
The sweep came ahead of a sensitive political anniversary in the semiautonomous Chinese territory. This Saturday marks five years since Beijing announced an electoral-reform plan that denied Hong Kong free elections - a decision that triggered 79 days of pro-democracy protests.
The latest protests were sparked by a now-shelved government proposal to allow extraditions to the mainland. But the demonstrations have broadened into a battle over the extent of Beijing's control over the former British colony.
Protesters fear Beijing's leaders could increasingly undercut the special freedoms and status granted to Hong Kong under the deal that returned the territory in 1997.
Patrick Kwok, chief superintendent of the police's public relations branch, told a news conference Friday that the timing of the arrests and the anniversary of the 2014 demonstrations were ""not correlated.""
The dissent coincides with a delicate period for the ruling Communist Party, as the clock ticks down to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in October. China's government has issued increasingly strident threats in an effort to quell the unrest. A day earlier, China sent a new batch of troops to Hong Kong to reinforce the People's Liberation Army garrison in the city.
Friday's arrests, combined with the garrison rotation and rumors that Hong Kong may invoke emergency laws, were ""extremely alarming,"" said Samantha Hoffman, a fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute who studies Chinese politics.
""At the very least, it is clear that Beijing is attempting to intimidate the people of Hong Kong. The Chinese Communist Party places political protests very high on its list of threat perceptions,"" she said.
""The party will protect itself before it defends the objective interests of China, the Chinese people, and Hong Kong and its people. Therefore, it is hard to imagine a solution where the party backs down in any meaningful way.""
In a report after the roundup of the Hong Kong activists, China's official Xinhua news agency said more arrests were expected. Hours later, Xinhua posted a picture on its social media account with a pair of handcuffs and images of Wong, Chow and Chan with the caption, ""What goes around comes around.""
Police have arrested more than 800 people in connection with protests that have rocked the city since June, some of them on riot charges that can attract a prison sentence of up to 10 years.
After his release on bail, Wong was defiant. ""We will continue our fight no matter how they arrest and prosecute us,"" he told reporters. 
Man-Kei Tam, director of Amnesty International in Hong Kong, said the wave of arrests and the banning of the march appeared to be ""straight out of Beijing's playbook.""
Wong, 22, became known as the face of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, a street occupation aimed at securing universal suffrage for Hong Kong. He was charged and sentenced several times in connection with those protests, and he served three stints in jail. Most recently, on May 16, Wong was sentenced to two months in prison after losing an appeal against a prison term for contempt of court. He was released in June.

Along with Chow and another activist, Nathan Law, Wong went on to found the political group Demosisto, which advocates self-determination for Hong Kong. The three were arrested in 2017 ahead of Chinese leader Xi Jinping's visit to the city. 
This time, the protest movement in Hong Kong has taken a leaderless form - in part to avoid arrests and detentions that plagued its leaders in the past, and to empower a broader base of participants. Unlike in 2014, members of Demosistō have not delivered speeches at rallies, nor have they been prominent faces on the front lines, but have used the group's social media presence to promote their cause globally.
""We'll use our influence and connections with the international community to tell the world about what's happening,"" Chow said in an earlier interview with The Washington Post. ""It's still very important.""
On Friday, Wong was seized at roughly 7:30 a.m. ""when he was suddenly pushed into a private car on the street,"" Demosistō said. Chow was arrested a short time later at her home, Demosistō added. Both are being held in the Hong Kong police headquarters in the Wan Chai district. 
The group has sought help from its lawyers.
Wong and Chow were due to travel to Washington next month, where they were to meet with lawmakers and participate in a congressional Executive Committee on China hearing on the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The bill, which has bipartisan support, including from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), seeks to punish those who suppress freedoms in Hong Kong, including through the use of sanctions and visa bans to the United States.
Chan, who founded a party that advocates for Hong Kong independence, was also arrested in August on suspicion of possessing offensive weapons and bombmaking materials. 
Hong Kong operates under a ""one country, two systems"" arrangement within China, under which the city is supposed to enjoy a high degree of autonomy for 50 years following its return to Chinese rule in 1997. Concerns have grown, though, that Beijing is tightening control over the territory and eroding the freedoms and autonomy that distinguish Hong Kong from mainland China.
President Xi said in a 2017 speech that he viewed any efforts to endanger Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong or challenge the authority of Beijing as a ""red line.""
In a tweet the night before his arrest, Wong wrote that ""Being born in uncertain times carries certain responsibilities."" He linked to a website outlining protesters' demands.

Shih reported from Beijing. Anna Kam in Hong Kong contributed to this report."
China's mistake in Hong Kong,"CHINA'S RULERS made it clear Monday that they don't have any new ideas about how to respond to the protests shaking Hong Kong. At a rare
news conference in Beijing, officials who deal with Hong Kong affairs defended the police crackdown with clubs and tear gas, and referred to the demonstrators as ""radical elements"" committing ""evil and criminal acts."" The China Daily, a Communist Party mouthpiece, denounced the protesters as ""colluding with external forces."" These words are timeworn, stale - and false. 
The powers in Beijing are hinting at the use of People's Liberation Army forces to put down the protests, but so far have only hinted, and expressed hope that Hong Kong's compliant leader, Carrie Lam, as well as local police, can keep a lid on the demonstrations for now. But the tone of Monday's remarks was uncompromising and signaled that Chinese President Xi Jinping sees this crisis as yet another moment when expressions of dissent and freedom must be snuffed out. Rather than accept that Hong Kongers have a legitimate beef and a right to say so, China's authorities have painted the demonstrators as illegitimate, being ""carefully orchestrated"" from outside, as the China Daily put it. The protests, the news outlet said, are ""of the same hue as the color revolutions that were instigated in the Middle East and North Africa,"" an image of the Arab Spring that terrifies China's ruling party-state. 
Hong Kong police have faced off against demonstrators with tear gas and rubber bullets, saying some protesters have hurled bricks. The protesters are showing up at different locations and long into the night, disregarding calls by police to disband. Recently, some protesters were attacked by thugs while the police stood by. If the leaders in Beijing were smart, they would see that the protests that began in June are morphing into something more desperate than before, and they would be responsive to the demands. Instead, they dismiss the protests outright.
The demonstrations were first sparked by opposition to legislation allowing extradition of suspects - including dissidents - from Hong Kong to the mainland, where they could be subject to Communist Party whims. Ms. Lam has said the legislation is shelved, but she has not outright canceled it and stood fast against any other concessions. Meanwhile, the protesters have broadened their demands to include an investigation of police brutality, and Ms. Lam's resignation.
The 1997 handover of Hong Kong promised ""one country, two systems"" in which the territory could preserve its autonomy and freedoms for 50 more years. By chipping away at those freedoms and by using strong-arm tactics to suppress the protests, China's leaders are revealing their true intent, which is one country, one system - to coerce Hong Kong into the mainland's grip. This month's protests showed that Hong Kong's people will not march silently to this fate. China is making a large and potentially costly mistake by failing to understand the protests and the reasons behind them."
Hong Kong expats back protests - even flying home to join in,"Many mobilize against bill that would allow extradition to China
Like thousands of Hong Kong natives living abroad, Stan Cheung had been following the anti-extradition protests in his homeland closely. On June 12, as he scrolled through Facebook videos of police unleashing tear gas and rubber bullets on protesters, the 26-year-old software engineer from Northern Virginia decided he needed to do more.
He asked his boss for permission to work remotely and bought the earliest ticket he could find out of Reagan National Airport. Two days later, just hours after arriving and dropping off his bags at his brother's apartment, Cheung joined 2 million people in Hong Kong for the largest protest in the city's history. Demonstrations quieted this past week but resumed in force Friday.
""I knew I couldn't just sit behind a monitor,"" Cheung, who lives in Reston and has been in the United States since 2012, said in a telephone interview. ""I didn't want to be a free-rider and watch my friends fight for freedom for me.""
The overseas Hong Kong community has mobilized in historic numbers since protests erupted this month against a controversial extradition bill that would allow Hong Kong authorities to hand over to China people charged with crimes. Opponents call it a dangerous overreach of Beijing's authority over the former British colony.
Few have gone to such lengths as Cheung, but in dozens of cities in the United States, Europe and Australia, protests have been organized in solidarity with the demonstrators in Hong Kong.
Anna Yeung-Cheung, a professor of biology at Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y., immigrated from Hong Kong in 1987 and is a coordinator for the Facebook group Global Solidarity for Hong Kong. The professor, 54, said protests abroad have largely mirrored the ""leaderless"" movement in the city itself, with pockets of citizens voluntarily organizing events.
In New York, more than 1,500 turned up for a June 9 march from Times Square to the Chinese Consulate. Two protests in the District, where the Hong Kong community is smaller, each drew around 60 people.
Former residents of Hong Kong who live in the Washington area have followed the protests in their homeland closely, said Kak Wong, 27, a graduate student at the University of Maryland at College Park. Many have stayed up through the night to monitor developments on social media, he added, and some are active in private chat groups being used to gather and distribute information for protesters back home.
The overseas community took similar action during Hong Kong's""Umbrella Revolution"" in 2014, but not on this scale, said Jeffrey Ngo, chief researcher for the pro-democracy movement Demosisto. Their recent efforts have raised the profile of the anti-extradition movement, he said, and spurred lawmakers elsewhere in the world to pressure Hong Kong officials to withdraw the bill.
""In rallies in Taiwan and Tokyo, we're seeing participants that aren't just overseas Hong Kongers but actual Japanese and Taiwanese citizens,"" said Ngo, a 23-year-old PhD student at Georgetown University. ""What we're seeing is how the Hong Kong diaspora has influenced local communities to support our cause.""
On Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told reporters she would back bipartisan legislation requiring the Trump administration to affirm Hong Kong's rights as a semiautonomous region of China. Lawmakers in Canada, Japan and Britain have also criticized the extradition bill.
After days of protests, Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, suspended the bill and later apologized
for the ""anxiety"" caused to citizens. But activist groups are not satisfied. They have threatened further protests if the government refuses to withdraw the bill entirely and accede to other demands.
Yeung-Cheung said Hong Kong expatriates are ready to protest alongside them. There is talk of holding activities in conjunction with the July 1 demonstrations, which are held annually in Hong Kong to commemorate the city's 1997 handover from Britain to China.
""For people overseas, what we want is for the next generation to have the life we used to have,"" she said.
Cheung, the software engineer who went home to join the protests, agreed. Worried that his parents would disapprove of him flying home just to join the demonstrations, Cheung has been living with his brother. During the day, he tries distractedly to get work done; at night, he meets with high school friends to reminisce about ""Old Hong Kong.""

As a boy, Cheung remembers, he looked up to the police officers in his neighborhood of Tung Chung. But on Friday, he joined thousands of demonstrators at the police headquarters in downtown Hong Kong to call for a formal investigation into their use of tear gas and rubber bullets days earlier.
Armed with goggles and a bottle of water, Cheung stood among his peers, chanting in Cantonese: ""Shame on the Hong Kong police!""
Throughout the seven years he has spent in the United States, Cheung said, he always thought he would be returning home at some point. Now, he is not so sure.
""If Hong Kong is no longer Hong Kong, I don't know what we'll do,"" he said.

Xi affirms support for Lam amid continuing protests in Hong Kong,"Chinese leader seeks
 to project strength as he
also faces U.S. trade war 


BEIJING - Chinese leader Xi Jinping is doubling down on his support for embattled Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam as he seeks to project an image of assuredness amid political challenges from China's southern periphery and from the United States.
Seated at the end of a long, narrow meeting room in Shanghai, Xi told Lam late Monday that the central government maintained a ""high degree of trust in you and full acknowledgment of you and your governance team,"" according to a report Tuesday by the Chinese state broadcaster, which aired video of Xi smiling and appearing relaxed as he addressed Hong Kong's leader.
The meeting was meant to throw Beijing's weight behind Lam but may harden the pattern of intensifying confrontation between Hong Kong authorities and protesters who are calling for Lam's resignation and full democracy in the semiautonomous territory, among other demands. 
Lam has struggled for five months to restore calm by ratcheting up the use of police force to counter worsening violence, which has featured attacks by protesters against establishments linked to, or seen as supportive of, mainland China.
For weeks, speculation has swirled around whether Lam would be replaced or step down - and, even if she wanted to, whether Beijing would allow it. Lam sparked the crisis in the former British colony this year when she fast-tracked a bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China. Hong Kong people took to the streets to oppose what they saw as an attempt to diminish their autonomy and relative freedoms that do not exist in mainland China.
Xi told Lam that ""ending violence and chaos and restoring order remains the most important task for Hong Kong,"" and he praised her for ""leading her government to fulfill its duties, striving to stabilize the situation, and doing a lot of arduous work,"" the official Xinhua News Agency reported Tuesday. 
The meeting in Shanghai reinforced a sense of the Chinese leadership firmly holding course on several fronts through a tumultuous autumn. Last week, the ruling Communist Party concluded a Central Committee conclave that was notable for the absence of major announcements - except for a communique suffused with ideology and reiterating political backing for Xi. 
Shen Chunyao, a top legislative official who deals with Hong Kong affairs, hinted that Beijing could return to two strategies it has previously attempted to shore up control over Hong Kong: encourage the city to pass a national security law and reinforce patriotic education for disaffected youth - measures that sparked protests when officials attempted to introduce them in the past.
On a spate of issues, including the Hong Kong crisis and the trade war with the United States, Xi appeared to be ""persisting in what he's doing and thinking the problem isn't the policy direction, but implementation,"" said Steve Tsang, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Nottingham who is critical of what he described as an ossification of policy debate in Beijing. 
""It's like driving a car off the road and thinking it's not going in the wrong direction - it's just not driving fast enough,"" he said. 
On the trade front, Xi appeared Tuesday at a trade fair, where he toned down some of the sharper language previously aimed at Washington. But he also rolled out well-tread pledges to expand trade, lower tariffs and live up to regulatory overhauls that have opened the door for more foreign investment. 

After he spoke, Xi sipped wine with French President Emmanuel Macron as he stressed China's commitment to low tariffs and open global markets. At the expo were booths from 192 American companies, including household names such as General Electric and John Deere.
Even though the Trump administration this week talked up the chances of a ""phase one"" trade truce with China, Taoran Notes, a state-run blog believed to be published by officials close to China's negotiating team, published a new post Tuesday reiterating a firm position: China will not budge on its consistent and ""core"" condition that President Trump remove existing tariffs as part of any deal.
""Any misjudgment on this issue could lead to repeated negotiations,"" the outlet warned the U.S. administration.
Timothy Stratford, chair of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, played down the likelihood of a substantial deal. Despite Xi's trade-fair talk and China's promises to buy American agricultural products, China did not appear to be offering fixes to long-standing U.S. complaints, such as Beijing's subsidies for certain businesses, Stratford said.
""The more I'm hearing from the Chinese, the more I hear 'we're actually doubling down on the economic model, we're not going to change our state intervention in key industries,' "" he said. 
Meanwhile in Hong Kong, one of Lam's deputies, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, said the fact that Xi made time to meet with Lam amid a trade agenda was ""pretty reassuring to us.""
""The very fact that he is so busy, that he found time to meet, really is a vote of confidence,"" he told reporters in Hong Kong.
After the meeting, the first between Lam and the top Chinese leader since the Hong Kong protests started in June, Xinhua carried photos of the two shaking hands and beaming smiles.
Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University, said Xi wanted to show he was digging in.
""He is personally taking responsibility for keeping her and contradicting rumors of her dismissal,"" Cabestan said. ""Xi has concluded that for the moment it is preferable to keep Carrie Lam than to change horses.""

Clashes upend quiet Hong Kong district,"One elderly woman wears a mask in her bathroom in case tear gas leaks in. A man added extra honey to his chicken wings recipe to mask the sour taste of the gas. 
A neighbor in his 90s put on hold his cherished ritual of spending the afternoon in the park with friends. Instead, he struggled to close his window from his motorized wheelchair as tear gas billowed up from street clashes 16 floors below.
Hong Kong's restive summer has shattered the routines of residents in the normally quiet neighborhood of Wong Tai Sin - and in dozens of other places across the territory as the pro-autonomy protests expand and evolve. 
Demonstrations are no longer confined to symbolic targets such as government buildings in central enclaves. They have spilled out into virtually all of Hong Kong's residential districts.
Once-familiar rhythms are being upended, and many have been left traumatized and confused as protests grow more unpredictable and intense. 
Residents have been forced to adapt in ways big and small.

Last weekend and into Monday, 93-year-old Ng, who gave only his last name, citing privacy concerns, stayed indoors as the working-class district best known for a temple that promises to heal the sick was gripped by street battles. 
He did not expect tear gas to be shot off in daylight Monday, and he struggled to close the windows of his apartment where he lives alone.
""I couldn't react fast enough,"" he said. ""It was very sudden."" Yiu, who similarly wanted to be identified only by his last name, said he was cooking in his kitchen that same day when tear gas seeped in for a third day in a row, engulfing his chicken wings.
""I had to put lots of honey on [the wings], to make sure the taste went away. But it was still there,"" he said.

Even the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has been drawn in. It published guidelines on what to do if household pets are exposed to tear gas. 
Amid the upheavals, political views are hardening, pitting communities against one another and against the police. 
No signs of compromise
It all came barging into Wong Tai Sin this month. 
Riot police entered the district Aug. 3 in pursuit of protesters. Residents, in T-shirts and shorts, emerged from apartments to face off with officers, demanding they leave. Police responded with arrests and a haze of tear gas. 
Clashes continued over the next two days, coinciding Monday with a Hong Kong-wide strike. Hong Kong's protests were sparked in early June by a now-shelved bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, but demands have since grown to include an independent investigation into police use of force against demonstrators and more autonomy for the former British colony.
Beijing and Hong Kong leaders have shown no sign of compromise, while police have dialed up their use of force and arrests. 
In a news conference Tuesday, Yang Guang, a spokesman for Beijing's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, warned protesters ""not to take restraint as a sign of weakness."" 
Chinese officials - meeting with Hong Kong leaders across the border in Shenzhen on Wednesday - rejected all protester demands, according to Michael Tien, a pro-Beijing lawmaker and delegate at the talks.
""The central government has made its decision; there is no more room to move,"" he said. ""We just have to unite and face this long struggle."" 
Protests flared anew Saturday. A sit-in at Hong Kong's airport entered its second day. Meanwhile, marchers took to the streets of Wong Tai Sin and other areas in defiance of a ban imposed by police. 
Posters in advance of the Wong Tai Sin protest showed a Taoist deity sitting in a lotus pose, wearing a full-face respirator to protect against tear gas, a reference to the famed temple. Cops and rebels
Residents and local leaders describe Wong Tai Sin as overwhelmingly safe and quiet, unlike other areas that have experienced occasional riots and gang activity linked to organized crime syndicates known as triads. A focal point of activity is the temple, where the entrance is lined with fortune tellers and shops selling charms, incense and flowers. 
During the day, the neighborhood is full of elderly residents and their helpers taking slow walks around the apartment blocks. 
""In general, it is one of the oldest constituencies in Hong Kong, with an aging community,"" said Wu Chi-Wai, a pro-democracy lawmaker whose constituency includes Wong Tai Sin.
In the politically diverse neighborhood, represented by a mix of pro-Beijing and pro-democracy politicians, residential complexes housing police officers and their families bump up against low-income housing towers. Yiu, who made the chicken wings at home, was among residents preparing for bed on Aug. 3 when loud noises erupted from outside. He looked on as residents briefly sent officers retreating, and then as police pushed back against residents yelling at ""everyone, even the old people.""

He heard a bang, and quickly felt something that ""hurt"" his nose - his first whiff of tear gas. 
""I couldn't imagine this would happen in my community,"" said the 38-year-old Yiu - who always thought the older generations who dominate the area were largely pro-Beijing. He hasn't been able to have a full night's sleep in days. 
Christine, a 24-year-old events manager, rushed out onto the streets on Aug. 3 when she saw live broadcasts of the conflict featuring the Catholic primary school she attended. 
""Everyone around me was just residents in their flip-flops, without helmets, gear or anything,"" she said, noting that she, too, had no protective gear when the first rounds of gas were fired. ""It caused a lot of panic.""
As she was walking back home after the conflict seemed to die down, she and other protesters were hit by a firecracker, flung from the apartments set aside for police and their families. Glass bottles were also thrown from those balconies toward protesters, an indication of the growing animosity between communities that once lived together. 
Tear gas canisters used: 800 
Police said they used 800 canisters of tear gas that Monday. They had used about 1,000 during the two months earlier. Responding to questions from journalists, senior superintendent Kong Wing-cheung said it wasn't the police who chose the neighborhoods where conflict broke out, but ""the violent protesters."" 
""So we're forced to use tear gas in residential areas,"" he said. 
In a news conference Friday, a panel of medical experts warned that repeated exposure to tear gas could cause a host of complications including pneumonia, bronchitis and gastrointestinal problems, and noted police have at times used expired canisters of gas, which pose additional hazards. The experience has transformed the views of one 55-year-old Wong Tai Sin resident, who declined to be named for fear of backlash from authorities. 
She had been supportive of the now-shelved extradition bill, and of the government - until she saw the risks to her elderly mother and her young son posed by police use of force. She closed all the windows, but poor sealing meant gas still seeped in, irritating her mother, who has now taken to wearing a mask in the bathroom. 
""Even if the protesters are quite violent, it doesn't mean you need to fire so much tear gas,"" she demanded. 
On Friday night, a different kind of rally was held in Wong Tai Sin. 
Protesters gathered to throw paper money at police officers and their residential quarters. The bills represent offerings to restless spirits who, in Chinese tradition, are believed to return to earth during the Hungry Ghost Festival this month.
They hurled curses and vulgarities along with the money.

"Amid fears of escalating violence, Hong Kong protesters occupy airport","Protest planned in same area where dozens were attacked last weekend

HONG KONG - Visitors arriving at Hong Kong's airport Friday were greeted by more than 1,000 black-clad protesters camped in the arrivals hall, a new gambit by demonstrators in weeks of anti-government unrest as fears grow of violent clashes this weekend.
Demonstrators chanted ""Free Hong Kong!"" and other slogans calling for an investigation of recent police tactics and gang attacks on pro-democracy activists. As passengers exited the baggage-claim area, arriving from places such as Dallas
and Shanghai, they were flanked by people holding signs warning that Hong Kong was no longer safe.
""Carrie Lam, step down!"" they shouted, referring to the city's embattled leader. Some wore hard hats and carried umbrellas, symbols of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. ""Please, don't trust the police,"" they cried.
The action, organized by aviation workers such as flight attendants and airport staff, marked the latest and most international phase in a campaign by Hong Kongers to safeguard the semiautonomous city's relative freedom and rule of law from what they see as the Chinese government's steady erosion of their rights. Unlike in previous protests, the demonstrators at the airport wrote signs and fliers primarily in English, and alternated between Cantonese and English chants. 
Weeks of protests here were triggered by a government plan to allow extraditions to mainland China. Hong Kong officials subsequently shelved the bill but have not formally withdrawn it - a key demand of protesters. The protest movement has grown to encompass broader demands, including Lam's resignation and an inquiry into police and gang violence against demonstrators. 
There are signs the struggle is taking on an international dimension, with protests planned across Australia this weekend.
Unrest in Hong Kong escalated on Sunday when groups of white-shirted men attacked protesters at a suburban train station, leaving dozens injured. Police took more than half an hour to respond, despite receiving 24,000 emergency calls about the incident. 
On Friday, many air passengers arriving in Hong Kong - one of the world's busiest hubs - seemed intrigued by the spectacle. They peered curiously at iPad screens held by protesters showing footage of Sunday's mob attack as protesters handed out fliers detailing their grievances. One warned visitors that the Hong Kong government ""employs thugs to beat protesters."" 
Some posters were written in the simplified Chinese characters used in mainland China, the top source of Hong Kong's tourists, where media coverage of the protests has been heavily censored.
Mainland visitors seemed hesitant to take the fliers. One young Chinese woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the demonstration was ""very bad and rude."" 
Others did not seem to mind. Disruption to passenger travel was minimal, with no immediate reports of delayed flights. The airport authority demarcated an area where the demonstrators could gather and set up clear passageways for arriving passengers. 
""I agree with them,"" said an 18-year-old who had arrived from France for an internship and gave her name only as Canelle. ""I also don't want China to have too much power. They are fighting for their rights."" She added, ""But it's not a good thing to see when you first arrive here.""
Some countries have warned their citizens about the situation in Hong Kong. Ireland this week issued a broad travel warning, while Canada, Singapore and Japan urged people to monitor and avoid areas where demonstrations are planned.
Seeking to dispel safety concerns, Hong Kong Commerce Secretary Edward Yau told foreign diplomats and business leaders in a letter this week that Hong Kong was a ""welcoming city for investors and visitors, and a safe city for travelers.""
""The vast majority of people taking part in processions do so in a peaceful and orderly manner,"" he wrote.

Police have defended their response to protests, including the use of tear gas, and have said they are overstretched. Officers arrested six people in connection with Sunday's mob attack in Yuen Long, near the border with mainland China. 
Further confrontations appear likely this weekend. Organizers of a protest planned for Saturday in the same area as Sunday's attack said they intend to go ahead with the rally even though police refused to authorize the event, citing safety risks, and warned that anyone showing up would be breaking the law.
Earlier in the week, China's government hinted at possible military options to quell the unrest. 
Elsewhere, anti-China protests organized by overseas Hong Kongers could expand to several Australian cities this weekend, including Sydney and Melbourne, after a campus clash in Brisbane was marred by violence.
China's government waded Thursday into a controversy over the clash at the University of Queensland, where students held competing demonstrations over Hong Kong that escalated into fistfights.
Hundreds of students, including many from Hong Kong, gathered Wednesday to condemn China's actions in Hong Kong and its clampdown in the western Xinjiang region, before they were confronted by Chinese students, who tore their posters and seized their loudspeaker, leading to a violent scuffle, according to participants and videos circulating on social media.
The organizer, Drew Pavlou, a 20-year-old student, said he was struck in the ribs, mouth and the side of his head.
""In the days after the protest, I received dozens of death threats, and my image was circulated"" on Chinese social media, he said. ""I have feared for my life.""
China's consulate general in Brisbane appeared to endorse its students' behavior afterward, saying in a statement that it ""affirms the spontaneous patriotic behavior of Chinese students"" and condemning what it called ""anti-China separatist activities"" taking place on campus.
The consulate urged Chinese students to pay attention to Australian laws and to their own safety but did not address the outbreak of campus violence.
The incident revived concerns about the phenomenon of nationalistic Chinese students stifling anti-Chinese speech on campuses worldwide. Many overseas Chinese students say they are surprised and personally offended by what they see as anti-Chinese sentiment once they head abroad.
Alex Joske, a researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute who specializes in the Communist Party's influence abroad, said there is no evidence that students were coordinated or directed to disrupt the Hong Kong demonstration this week, but there have been such documented cases in the past.
In 2008, Chinese students were mobilized to fight back against Free Tibet protesters during the Olympic torch relay passing through Australia.
""Whether or not the consulate specifically directed the events at Queensland, it clearly tries to ensure Chinese students understand they're expected to defend the Chinese government's image abroad,"" Joske said.
Other experts warn that Chinese consulates worldwide also encourage acts of nationalism and step in to offer guidance to overseas students. Images of a chat group seen by The Washington Post in February showed a Chinese consulate in Canada instructing Chinese students to take pictures and video at a campus talk by a Uighur activist they regarded as a separatist.

Strike disrupts Hong Kong as unrest continues,"Leader warns city is 'on the verge of a very dangerous situation'


HONG KONG - On Monday, Ken Kwok didn't head to his job in airline operations. Neither did financial planner Rachel Wong. Ashley Yue put her Hong Kong food tours on hold for the day. 
Instead, they joined civil servants, bus drivers, baristas and pilots in a citywide strike that shut down businesses, crippled Hong Kong's subway system and caused flight cancellations - an embarrassment for the Asian financial hub's beleaguered government. As protesters rallied across the city, even the happiest place on Earth wasn't immune: Dozens of workers at Hong Kong Disneyland went on strike, disrupting rides.
The actions - and the protest-linked chaos that ensued again - struck at Hong Kong's increasingly precarious position as an efficient base for business and signaled widening public anger over the failure of its leaders to offer concessions that could defuse weeks of political strife. 
Later in the day, police fired tear gas to clear demonstrators from roads and areas around police stations in several parts of the city and made at least 82 arrests. Brief scuffles broke out between protesters and counterdemonstrators in the neighborhood of North Point, east of central Hong Kong. The two groups lobbed traffic cones and sticks at each other.

The political crisis, triggered by now-suspended plans to allow extraditions to mainland China, has swollen as Hong Kongers demand the bill's full withdrawal, an independent inquiry into police actions toward protesters, greater democracy and amnesty for those arrested in clashes between demonstrators and police. 
Events over the past 72 hours underscored the disconnect between the city's residents and those who govern them. Footage broadcast on television showed dozens of residents of a working-class area yelling at police officers to get out of their neighborhood, accusing them of inciting trouble. 
After two weeks out of public view, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam emerged Monday to condemn the protests and the strike. She warned that the city was ""on the verge of a very dangerous situation"" but offered no concessions.
""As a result of these widespread disruptions and violence, the great majority of Hong Kong people are now in a state of great anxiety,"" she said. She urged Hong Kongers to ""say no to chaos."" 
But the general strike demonstrated the dissenters' increasing boldness. Many who didn't show up to work, especially government employees, risked losing their jobs or facing punishment from employers.
Kwok, the operations worker at Hong Kong Airlines, highlighted the strike's strategic intent.
""The airport is the most important piece of infrastructure to the government, and shows the world an image of Hong Kong,"" he said. ""This is a matter of economic development. Can the government risk it?"" 
Over 400 employees at the airline signed on to the strike, Kwok said, along with unions representing employees of Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong's largest carrier. More than 200 flights at Hong Kong airport - among the world's busiest - were canceled.
The airport authority said ""potential circumstances"" might affect operations and advised passengers to confirm the latest with their airlines.
Striking workers say their anxiety stems from police violence toward demonstrators and a sense that Hong Kong's leaders are not representing the city's interests and are ceding autonomy to China's central government. Chinese officials have warned of a crackdown; the army released a video last week that showed soldiers practicing shooting protesters.

On successive weekends, riot police have unleashed tear gas in densely populated Hong Kong neighborhoods. Police said Monday that they had fired more than 1,000 rounds of tear gas in the past two months and arrested more than 420 people, including some who face charges of rioting that carry up to 10 years in prison.
Outraged by the way that Lam and police have handled the crisis, protesters say it is time to raise the stakes. 
""We can't just go on marches forever,"" said Yue, a 26-year-old business owner who runs food and cultural tours. The strike would pressure the government by disrupting its systems, she said.
""It's about protecting Hong Kong's core values,"" she said. ""If we let the violent police get away with their crimes, Hong Kong won't be the Hong Kong we know anymore."" 
At a rally near government buildings in the downtown area Monday, a lawyer said half her firm of a few hundred did not show up to work. Strikers included a 40-year-old who manufactures computer parts, a 36-year-old health services worker and a 26-year-old teacher.
Even at Disneyland, employees said the city's leaders were in dreamland.
The government is trying to ""escape reality"" by not listening to protesters' demands, said Alice Tam, 26. 

Denunciations of police have intensified since dozens of armed men, suspected to be linked to organized-crime gangs, attacked protesters returning from a rally last month. Police took almost 40 minutes to arrive, by which time more than 40 people were hurt, some seriously. Senior police defended the response and said they were stretched thin.
Police have arrested only eight people in those attacks, on relatively light charges of unlawful assembly. 
Meanwhile, Hong Kong's economy is suffering. Official data last week showed the economy contracted 0.3 percent on a quarterly basis, while annual growth slowed to 0.6 percent. The Hang Seng stock index, which fell nearly 3 percent Monday, has suffered amid fears that the clashes have hurt Hong Kong's status as a business center. 
Paul Chan, the city's finance secretary, warned that Hong Kong could tip into recession, pointing to a drop in sales of luxury goods and jewelry.

"With little hope of success, Hong Kong protesters keep confronting Beijing","HONG KONG - When 27-year-old Yap entered Hong Kong's Legislative Council building, stepping over shards of glass and twisted metal into a chamber occupied by helmeted young protesters, the first word he saw spray-painted inside was ""payback.""
He immediately understood what it meant. 
Born and raised in Hong Kong, he survives on less than $1,300 a month in a city more expensive than San Francisco and New York. He can't choose his own leader, who is handpicked by and subservient to Beijing, and the young representatives he voted for were disqualified from the legislature. He participated in the 2014 occupation of Hong Kong streets, which lasted 79 days before it was crushed, its leaders jailed and its call for universal suffrage resoundingly denied.
""In this situation, I can do nothing but take a risk,"" said Yap, who asked to be identified only by his last name for fear of retribution. ""Maybe we have a 1 percent chance to win. Maybe it will draw the attention of Beijing and change something later."" 
And if not, he added: ""At least I went to the front lines and helped. I will not regret it, since I have tried my best. And I am not afraid, since I have nothing to lose."" 
The unprecedented scenes of protesters breaking into Hong Kong's legislature on Monday, after weeks of sustained demonstrations, have jolted many around the world and in this modern, skyscraper-studded global financial hub. 
But for the tens of thousands here who have aided, supported or directly participated in illegal acts of civil disobedience over recent weeks, there has simply been no other choice.
Despite the long odds of changing the course of the Hong Kong government - and Beijing's solidifying grip - many protesters say the only way forward is to keep fighting, with the territory's history of demonstrations and relative freedoms firmly in mind. 
""Hong Kong is at the edge of losing everything,"" said a 24-year-old female protester. ""People cannot judge what [actions are] worthwhile or not. We just simply want to struggle for the limited freedom and value of Hong Kong."" 
Hong Kong was promised a high degree of autonomy when the British handed the territory back to China in 1997, 22 years ago Monday. This arrangement, known as ""one country, two systems,"" was guaranteed until 2047.
This framework is also what allows countries such as the United States to treat Hong Kong as somewhat separate from China, unaffected by policies like the trade war. In a tweet Wednesday, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said he was watching Hong Kong protesters ""exercise"" their freedoms as America celebrates its own on July 4.
He tweeted that Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam ""should remember Hong Kong's special status is not guaranteed.""
In the two decades since China resumed sovereignty, attempts to erode Hong Kong's freedoms - including a package of onerous sedition laws introduced in 2003, and a 2010 proposal for a national education syllabus praising Chinese communism and denouncing Western democracy - were derailed by mass protests. 
More recently, however, the failure of the 2014 protests against Beijing's political involvement in Hong Kong left behind a disappointed generation of young activists who had been mobilized and invigorated by their fight for democracy.
This time - fueled by public outrage at plans to allow extraditions to China, and their government's response to the discontent - many in Hong Kong felt they had to take extreme measures in defense of their territory. One of the graffiti messages scribbled on the walls of the vandalized Legislative Council building read: ""You taught me peaceful protests are futile.""

Hours after the protesters occupied the legislature on Monday night, riot police moved in, firing tear gas to send the demonstrators retreating in scenes of chaos.
Police on Wednesday vowed to ""bring the culprits to justice,"" raising the specter of mass arrests as they and forensic experts began documenting evidence.
Already police said they have arrested eight people who allegedly exposed officers' private information online, leading to threats against them and their families.
Lam has suspended the extradition bill but not fully withdrawn it. She has declined to meet with protesters or pro-democracy lawmakers, or to step down as they have demanded.
Antony Dapiran, author of a book on protest culture in Hong Kong, says that while the spark for demonstrations has varied over the years, the bottom line remains the same. 
""The underlying anxiety and the tension that seems to be propelling all of them is this sense that Hong Kongers are not the masters of their own destiny and don't govern themselves fully,"" Dapiran said. ""As that cycle of protest has recurred, we are starting to see a pattern of it getting more extreme."" 
The Chinese government's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office in a statement backed criminal punishments for the protesters. Martin Liao, a member of Hong Kong's cabinet and the leader of a pro-Beijing camp in the legislature, said the protesters had treated the rule of law as though it was ""nothing"" and branded them ""thugs"" who must be arrested. 
For protesters like 22-year-old Karl, who was in the building on Monday, this response was predictable - yet there was a more important consideration. 
""I was most afraid of losing my future, since I know that [storming the building] is a serious charge,"" he said. But he heard that protesters inside needed food and water after hours spent smashing their way in. He was moved when he saw girls younger than him rush in to participate. ""I was inspired by their courage, regardless of death. I thought I should do something for them."" 
Yap, the 27-year-old, added: ""Maybe it is only blood that will help shape political power.""

Hong Kong activist barred from vote,"Pro-democracy leader won't be allowed to seek seat on advisory council
HONG KONG - Authorities on Tuesday barred Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong from running in local elections, citing concerns that he does not respect China's sovereignty over the territory - a step that threatens to inflame tensions after months of civil unrest.
The decision comes as pro- democracy candidates look poised to gain in the Nov. 24 vote from public fears over an erosion of freedoms in the Asian financial hub. Wong, a leader of 2014 pro-democracy protests, has criticized China's tightening grip on the territory and advocated for stronger international action against the Hong Kong government and its allies in Beijing. 
Explaining her decision in a letter Tuesday, Laura Aron, an official who manages elections, said there was a ""consistent case"" that Wong and his party believe ""the independence of Hong Kong is an option"" for the self-determination of its people. She added that it was ""questionable whether Mr. Wong accepted the People's Republic of China's sovereignty"" over Hong Kong. Aron had abruptly replaced another elections official, Dorothy Ma, who had been screening Wong's candidacy but went on indefinite sick leave Thursday, according to the Electoral Affairs Commission.
Wong, the only candidate to be disqualified, has said he does not support Hong Kong's independence, nor is it the official line of his party, Demosisto.
Excluding Wong was clearly a ""politically driven"" decision, said Kenneth Chan, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University who is running a project observing the local elections.

""Obviously Joshua Wong's disqualification has a lot to do with his global profile as well as his activism in Hong Kong and overseas,"" Chan said.

 A statement from the Hong Kong government said Wong ""cannot possibly comply"" with the requirements of electoral law and accused him of promoting ""self-determination,"" or independence for Hong Kong. 
The decision was viewed as another setback for political freedoms in the former British colony, which over the past five months has been rocked by increasingly violent pro-democracy protests and an escalating police crackdown.
""Beijing has deprived me of my right to institutional participation permanently, but my commitment to the democracy movement will never be eroded,"" Wong said in a news conference. ""This disqualification is because my name is Joshua Wong. Unless I change my name, they will continue disqualifying me.""
Hong Kong's government is not democratically elected, but the city holds a quasi-democratic process to choose councilors in 18 local districts who advise the government. Democratic elections are a key demand of the protest movement.
https://twitter.com/joshuawongcf/status/1189020308021202944?s=20"">
Public anger over deteriorating political rights in Hong Kong is expected to result in a backlash against pro-Beijing candidates in next month's vote. A poll from the Chinese University of Hong Kong published by the Ming Pao newspaper on Thursday found 44.5 percent of people identified as pro-democracy, up from 27.9 percent in March. Only 6 percent of respondents supported the pro-Beijing camp.
Wong is not a central figure in the current unrest, which is largely leaderless. But he remains the most internationally recognized of the city's democracy activists, having shot to fame as a leader of the 2014 Umbrella Movement calling for universal suffrage. He was jailed three times for his role in the protests and was most recently released in June, before being arrested again in August.
China has characterized Wong as a separatist, and President Xi Jinping has said any effort to challenge Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong is a red line for the ruling Communist Party. While barring Wong from next month's contest, authorities permitted other pro-democracy figures to run, including some with more-radical views and others who have been disqualified from previous elections. 


Still, Wong's exclusion marks a snub for one of Hong Kong's best-known faces of protest. The 23-year-old has fashioned himself into an unofficial ambassador for the movement and has traveled to countries such as the United States and Germany to rally foreign support.

The Hong Kong protesters are scared but resolute,"HONG KONG

As the hopes of the Arab Spring dissolved into brutality and chaos in 2011, I reported from Cairo's Tahrir Square. Motorbikes roared through clouds of tear gas to pull out injured men with bloodied faces from the front line, where soldiers were deliberately shooting demonstrators in the eyes.
Now I am in Hong Kong, where one of the planet's busiest airports has been largely closed for the second time in two days after protesters marched there in anger at police violence. Many had bandages or patches over one eye in solidarity with a young woman who was shown in a video that went viral on Sunday, her right eye bloodied by what the protesters say was a beanbag projectile fired by the police.

Such outrage over the wounding of one woman highlights what these protesters have been fighting to preserve for the past two months. A gentle city, one of the world's financial centers that has grown rich from globalization and China's rise, is battling to retain its values of civic and social freedom.
The Hong Kong police, for all their woeful failings, are not thugs; the protesters could not be further from Beijing's accusations that they are terrorists. Yet this is a clash of cultures symbolizing the struggle of our time between autocracy and democracy as it rapidly spirals into something dark, depressing and disruptive for global order.
The protesters are mostly young and well-educated. Many are teenagers. All are polite and friendly when I ask why they are taking such risks amid the tear gas, the rubber bullets and the baton charges. And all give me the same response: that they are scared to be confronting well-armed police on their streets but determined to resist their looming future under the rigid, repressive control of China's Communist leadership. ""Our younger people are prepared to sacrifice their lives for the cause of freedom,"" Martin Lee, the veteran pro-democracy politician, told me.
I feel both ashamed and inspired to see such courage at a time when complacent Westerners are growing disenchanted with their own democracies and turning to crass populists. For this fight in Hong Kong may have begun over an extradition bill that inflamed justified fears that the ""one country, two systems"" agreement with Britain in the 1997 handover was being corroded. But the Beijing stooges in the local government refused to give ground, even after up to 2 million citizens marched in protest. Now the movement has morphed into something far more profound: the biggest internal challenge to the Chinese government by dissenters since the student-led Tiananmen Square protests 30 years ago.
One 16-year-old pro-democracy activist told me she never followed politics until Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's inflexible and incompetent chief executive, ignored the mass march. The young woman began by nervously joining the teams distributing supplies of food, water, helmets, gas masks and zip ties for building barricades. Now she is at the front, furious at being gassed and hit by a police baton while drawing strength from fellow protesters despite the threat of 10 years in prison if caught. ""Of course I'm still afraid,"" she said - but then asked if they should let China ""deprive us of all our freedoms until we lose freedom of speech completely?""
This teenager's tale shows how the crisis and violence are escalating on both sides. Protesters learned from the failure of the ""Umbrella Movement"" in 2014, which ended with the jailing of its young leaders. So they eschew leaders, hide identities (often under umbrellas) and rely on their technology skills to outwit foes.
Over the past two weeks, I have seen how they have shifted from fixed confrontations into fluid ""flash mobs"" that block roads and tunnels, then move on quickly before riot squads arrive. On Saturday, I followed a small army of black-clad, masked men and women as they boarded a train to shift locations. Meanwhile, the police are speeding up their responses, using plainclothes officers to hide among protesters, arresting more people, firing more tear gas and generally becoming more ferocious.
This is a tragedy for one of the world's great cities. Lam warns rightly that Hong Kong is facing an abyss, although she refuses to offer compromise. Alarm is growing as China becomes increasingly bellicose in its warnings, with officials talking about ""budding shoots of terrorism"" and video emerging of the People's Armed Police assembling in heavy forces in nearby Shenzhen, allegedly for riot-control exercises.
Analysts believe that China's autocratic President Xi Jinping wants the crisis resolved before his republic celebrates its 70th anniversary in October. Alan Lau Yip-shing, a senior police officer involved in crushing the 2014 Hong Kong protests, has been suddenly yanked from retirement to oversee these festivities and assist in restoring order.
The protesters might have morality on their side, but they are confronting the might of an emerging superpower. I asked one 25-year-old urging on protesters at the weekend amid clashes: Will you win? ""No,"" he replied instantly, before adding: ""But this is a long war, and who knows how it will end?""

Thousands link hands at vigil in Hong Kong,"Protest turns more peaceful as Beijing becomes more aggressive

HONG KONG - Inspired by an effort 30 years ago in the Baltic states that called for the end of Soviet rule, tens of thousands in Hong Kong on Friday held hands under the night sky to form a human chain snaking 27 miles across the territory, in a vigil against an increasingly authoritarian China intent on clamping down against their protest movement.

""Hong Kongers, Add Oil!"" they chanted, a phrase that loosely translates to keep going. ""Democracy now!""
Parts of the human chain passed hand sanitizer down the line before holding their hands up in the air, linking themselves with friends, family and strangers. Participants turned on their cellphone lights and waved them toward the sky, illuminating the city's most iconic neighborhoods, including along Victoria Harbor, as passing cars honked in deafening support.
""I was a bit embarrassed holding strangers' hands at first,"" said one 29-year-old participant who wanted to be identified just by his last name, Lam. ""But later, I thought, we are family. Why not?""
As they held their peaceful demonstration - its imagery harking back to the similarly implausible fight against the Soviet Union's power in 1989 - there were more signs that Beijing is becoming increasingly aggressive in its efforts to stamp out the protests and squeeze entities seen as supportive of them.
Rebecca Sy, who heads a union representing flight attendants from Cathay Pacific's regional airline, held a news conference Friday announcing her termination, among the more than a dozen aviation industry workers forced out in connection to the political demonstrations. Diplomats, too, have come under pressure: A Hong Kong passport holder working for the British Consulate was detained while trying to return to the semiautonomous territory from Shenzhen, prompting the Canadian Consulate to halt mainland visits for its staff.
""All of these events, they are all related to the same thing, which is China taking away our freedoms,"" said Noelle, a 53-year old wedged in the line, who wanted to be identified by only her first name for fear of repercussions over her participation. ""This is exactly what we don't want in Hong Kong, and that is why we are here today.""
Noelle, along with a majority of participants, had their faces obscured with masks - an indication of the fear that has gripped this city. Protesters interviewed believe that even participating in peaceful protests can get one fired from their jobs or otherwise put them at risk.
Friday's human chain, dubbed the ""Hong Kong Way,"" was an idea borrowed from an almost 400-mile long gathering of 2 million people in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Their demonstration was a bid for independence from the Soviet Union, and the show of unity discredited the Russian narrative at a time when Baltic independence was a fringe idea promoted by a group of radicals. 
The months that followed saw the decline and eventual collapse of the Soviet Union and independence for the Baltic states.
Hong Kong protesters participating in the vigil are fighting for their government to recognize demands that have hardened over their months-long protest movement. Triggered by a now-shelved extradition bill that would have allowed fugitives to be transferred to the mainland, demonstrators have been angling for an independent investigation into police use of force; they also want their government to be directly elected, believing their leaders serve Beijing rather than Hong Kong.
The idea for Friday's protest was first floated on the online messaging board LIHKG.com, which has served as a nucleus for strategies and mobilization over the past weeks. When thousands responded positively to the idea, seeing parallels between their fight against Beijing and that of the Baltic states against Russia, a loose group of organizers came together to discuss logistics and feasibility on the secure messaging app Telegram.
Preparations for the human chain were
complex logistically, said a 24-year old organizer who wanted to be known by the initials J.C. for fear of reprisal. In recent days, groups of volunteers have gone out to test the routes by making a short chain of people, testing out safety issues such as the presence of pedestrian crossings and roads. Organizers created a Google form to poll thousands of people on where they would like to gather and at what time they were planning to show up, and used live metrics on Friday night to assign people to less crowded areas of the city.
The route, which stretched across Hong Kong island, the Kowloon area across Victoria Harbor and the New Territories area which borders mainland China, was deliberately planned near subway stops to make participation convenient. More than 40 ""team leaders"" were on site on Friday, J.C. said, to direct the crowd and observe any safety considerations.
""We are very excited about it. It is a new form of protest happening in Hong Kong,"" he said. ""We've never done anything like this before.""
Protesters in recent weeks have urged nonviolent ways of getting their government's attention, after escalating violence between police, those perceived to sympathize with them and protesters. On a pages-long thread on LIHKG.com, some front-line protesters - more accustomed to ripping bricks off sidewalks and preparing for drawn-out confrontations with riot police - admitted that holding hands seemed ""lame"" but was an important show of unity at a pivotal time for Hong Kong.
The action on Friday came amid indications of an increasingly multifaceted crackdown on those who support the protests, which has targeted diplomats and multinational corporations in the city, particularly Cathay Pacific Airways. The detention of the British Consulate employee, Simon Cheng, was a ""lesson of what will happen to us if the extradition bill passed,"" added Lam, one of the participants of Friday's protest.
On Friday, Sy, the head of the flight attendant union, said she was sacked Tuesday after confirming to management that she had posted several messages on her Facebook account that could be viewed only by her friends. She has worked for the airline for 17 years. China's aviation authority has been exerting unprecedented pressure on Hong Kong's flagship airline, banning any crew who have expressed support for recent protests from flights through mainland airspace.
In a statement posted on the company website, Cathay Pacific's director for corporate affairs James Tong said his company ""fully supports the upholding of the Basic Law and all the rights and freedoms afforded by it,"" referencing the framework that gives Hong Kong significant autonomy from mainland China.
""We are a leading international airline with global operations and therefore we are required to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate,"" he added.

Cause for hope from Hong Kong,"Sometime in the past decade, neoliberals began nervously checking their premises about the inevitable triumph of liberal market democracy. Maybe civil liberties, the rule of law, and free and fair elections weren't so easily installed in societies that had never enjoyed them. Maybe those attributes weren't essential for economic growth, either. Worst of all, it began to seem possible that maybe billions of people in the world weren't even particularly interested in them. The market liberals who had once confidently debated ""When will China democratize?"" began lopping the first word off that question.
There's a strong argument that China won't democratize anytime soon. Chinese elites sincerely view democratization as a threat, not just to their own position but also to prosperity and social order. And the Chinese Communist Party has produced quite a lot of both over the past few decades, however appalling some of its production tools are.
But if you question whether any serious number of Chinese people even want democracy at the moment, you have only to look at the stunning images that came out of Hong Kong this weekend, as a reported 2 million people poured into the streets to protest a proposed law that would allow criminals to be extradited to mainland China. 
Hong Kong has only 7.4 million people; an equivalent protest in the United States would have seen 88 million people clogging every major artery. They marched even though police had waded into an earlier demonstration against the controversial extradition bill with tear gas and rubber bullets, injuring more than 70 people. Or perhaps they marched because of that.
We can't know what attitudes toward civil liberties and similar democratic institutions are on the mainland, because it would be impossible to get honest answers to such sensitive questions under a regime that exercises tight control over its citizens. 
What we can know is that, in Hong Kong, people are willing to defy such a regime to preserve their liberty. Maybe liberal institutions are an acquired taste, but maybe once you've had a taste you will never be satisfied with anything else. That may be why the Chinese, having taken Hong Kong back from the British in 1997 as a ""Special Administrative Region,"" have encountered such fierce resistance to making Hong Kong less special and more administered.
That was one theory of how China would eventually democratize: The more the United States traded with them, the more Chinese people would come to the United States to study or do business. As we imported their cheap manufactured goods, we would export the idea that it is the people who tell their governments what to do, rather than the other way around.
It all sounded splendid to us good liberal democrats. But China's leaders were also aware of the theory - and what we hope for, they fear. With China's integration into the world economy deepening, the past few years have seen, not a gradual relaxation of political control, but a sharp movement in the other direction.

The mainstays of civil society - lawyers, journalists, nongovernmental organizations, academics and religious groups - have all come under unrelenting pressure from a government that sees them as destabilizing forces. And techno-futurists have seen their optimism about the censorship- defeating capabilities of the Internet dramatically rebuffed by Beijing, which has effectively barred its citizens from seeing content that displeases the government.
Yet Hong Kong still offers market liberals one reason for optimism: After initially standing firm against the swelling extradition protests, the Chinese government eventually backed down. That's a sharp contrast with what happened during Hong Kong's last big wave of civil protest, the Occupy Central campaign for democratic elections in 2014, which the government ended without making any concessions. This time, Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam offered a public apology and said the legislative process on the bill would be indefinitely suspended. (Protesters want the suspension made permanent.)
What was different this time? Arguably, the Chinese government capitulated to Hong Kong's powerful business interests. In 2014, the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce opposed Occupy Central, warning that it would be bad for business. This time around, big multinationals offered workers flextime to strike.
But that optimism should be, at best, measured. Business stood up against extradition when it wouldn't stand up for democracy. The rule of law is vital to businesses, especially multinationals. Democratic governance, it would seem, is not. 
While markets may nudge at least one part of China in a more liberal direction, the country's citizens are probably going to have to walk most of the way on their own. And it's far from clear they can finish that journey with the Chinese Communist Party standing in their way.

The danger rises in Hong Kong,"CHINA'S PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY this week released a propaganda video threatening military violence against protesters in Hong Kong. There are rumors of a growing military presence on the border between mainland China and its city-state, which, according to China's past assurances, is meant to operate under a different (and freer) rule of law. In these circumstances, the United States should be doing everything possible to warn against a disastrous,
Tiananmen-style
crackdown. Instead, President Trump on Thursday effectively flashed a green light, referring to the mostly peaceful protests as ""riots"" that China has to ""deal with . . . themselves.""
It's not that Mr. Trump is unwilling to pressure China. This week, he was busy threatening new tariffs on imports from China and even criticizing that nation's Communist dictator, Xi Jinping, for whom Mr. Trump is normally full of praise. But the pressure is purely mercantilist. Mr. Trump cares about how many U.S. soybeans China buys. He doesn't care about China's laying waste to human rights - its concentration camps in western China, its imprisonment and torture of human rights lawyers, its threats against Hong Kong's freedoms.
A wiser president would care about both trade and liberty. A crackdown in Hong Kong would have dire consequences, not only for the many American businesses located there and the tens of thousands of Americans living there but also for China's reputation in Congress and beyond. If Beijing cannot keep its commitment to ""one country, two systems,"" under which Hong Kong is meant to operate with autonomy, why would anyone trust other promises it makes? A president interested in constructive U.S.-China relations would be making that point - while pushing back on the absurd Chinese accusations that the United States is fomenting the protests in Hong Kong.
In fact, people in Hong Kong began their protests when their leaders, who are unfailingly responsive to Beijing's wishes, promoted legislation that would have allowed for the easy extradition of people from Hong Kong to mainland China, including for political purposes. The massive popular outpouring prompted the leaders to suspend, but not withdraw, the bill. Now the protests have blossomed into calls for more democracy, which China over the years has foolishly blocked. In an unprecedented display of independence, thousands of civil servants defied orders to remain politically neutral by protesting Hong Kong's government on Friday. Financial employees
and medical practitioners have also held rallies. More protests are scheduled for this weekend. But instead of looking for accommodation, the official response has included riot charges against a number of protesters that could lead to 10-year prison terms.With Beijing amping up its pressure on Hong Kong and the White House taking the wrong side, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers - Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Ben Cardin (D-Md.), and Reps. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) and
Christopher H. Smith (R-N.J.) -
urged Mr. Trump to condemn China's stance: ""Failure to respond to Beijing's threats [to Hong Kong] will only encourage Chinese leaders to act with impunity,"" they wrote in an open letter. They are right."
Hong Kong protesters make case to mainland visitors,"HONG KONG - Another massive march in Hong Kong, this time held in an enclave frequented by Chinese tourists and connected by high-speed railway to the mainland, turned chaotic Sunday night after a smaller group of protesters occupied a major shopping road and was forcibly cleared by police.
The protesters, hoping to take their grievances against Beijing directly to the Chinese people, tried to engage with visitors from the mainland. Chanting ""Free Hong Kong!"" they marched in Tsim Sha Tsui, a tourist-heavy, mall-dotted neighborhood, toward a railway terminus that connects the semiautonomous territory to mainland China.
Organizers estimated turnout at 230,000 people; police put the crowd at its peak at around 56,000. But it was larger than expected, overflowing into roads that were not approved for the march. By night, a small crowd occupied streets in the area in defiance of riot police - prompting officers to tackle and beat some with batons. At least three people were arrested, local media reported.
The scenes were the latest in an escalating crisis that has gripped Hong Kong for more than a month, with determined protesters on one side and the Beijing-backed government and police on the other.
The protesters marched to the West Kowloon station, which opened in September and is subject to Chinese laws. It connects to China's snaking, billion-dollar high-speed rail network. 
Along their route, volunteers handed out posters advertising the upheaval in the city over the past few weeks, sparked by a now-suspended bill that would allow extraditions to the mainland. They designed leaflets in the simplified Chinese characters widely used on the mainland and shouted the purpose of their march over loudspeakers in Mandarin, the official language of China.
""Our idea is to spread messages to travelers and tourists, especially those from the mainland,"" said Yoanna, a 17-year-old student who would not give her last name for fear of retribution.

News in China has been highly censored since massive student-led pro-democracy demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989. Internet users in China who have searched for information about the Hong Kong protests have found their queries blocked.

State media has instead published stories, often completely false, that show widespread support in Hong Kong for mainland China.
Sustained protests have rocked the territory for more than a month. Chief Executive Carrie Lam paused the extradition proposal after the first week of marches but has declined to fully withdraw it or to step down, as protesters demand.
The marches have ballooned to include other demands, such as the release of jailed protesters and an investigation into police actions. They are shaping up to be a cohesive movement against Beijing's control over the territory.In the clearest demonstration yet against Beijing's authority and the legitimacy of the Hong Kong government, a group of protesters stormed and briefly occupied the Hong Kong legislature last week, on the 22nd anniversary of the territory's handover from the British to China.
Sunday's march marked a new escalation, the first time demonstrators have taken their message so close to the mainland's territory and people. Protesters sang the Chinese national anthem, coaxing mainland tourists to join in. Others shouted ""No rioters, only tyranny!"" at passersby - a reference to the Hong Kong government and mainland authorities labeling the occupation of the legislature as a violent, extreme act. 

Those opposed to the extradition bill say it would break a firewall separating Hong Kong's legal system from the Chinese one. They fear that the Chinese Communist Party will use the provisions to target people for political reasons.
""It is very important for us to explain to mainlanders what the consequences of this law are, even if they don't agree,"" Yoanna said.
Chinese tourists were either muted or critical in response. Some took the fliers and posters given out by the demonstrators, but others avoided them.
One tourist interviewed by a Hong Kong television news network called the situation ""chaos.""
""I'm afraid and don't want to travel to Hong Kong anymore,"" the woman, who identified herself as Mrs. Chen from Guangdong province, told i-Cable News. ""I even brought my kid here!""
Part of the Sunday march was permitted by police, but authorities erected water-filled barricades around the railway station. They restricted access to the station's interior to those who had tickets to travel. MTR, which runs the city's subway, restricted underground entrances to the station to travelers and implemented crowd-control measures. 

The march swelled beyond organizers' initial estimate of a few thousand, forcing police to open roads and push protesters into streets not authorized for the rally. By 10:30 p.m., protesters had occupied Nathan Road - an iconic thoroughfare lined with malls and hotels - while riot police stood ready to clear them forcibly. One pro-democracy legislator, Roy Kwong, pleaded with police and protesters, urging them to ""keep calm and reason with each other.""Some visitors from China picking up the posters appeared confused. They asked why some streets were blocked and heavily policed.
The signs, which praised the territory's freedoms and rights, cut to the heart of what separates Hong Kong - a territory that was promised significant autonomy, including its own government, press, immigration system and legal system - from the mainland.

""People seem scared to ask us more,"" said Hin Lee, 30, who was in the crowd with friends. ""We mainly want to pass along information. Hong Kong is the only place in China with free information, and so it is our responsibility to not only let the world know what is happening, but let mainlanders know.""
Chinese Internet users say their government is deleting references to and photos of Hong Kong protests on apps such as WeChat and Weibo. As a result, users have started using more oblique references, such as the Cantonese pop song ""Queen's Road East,"" which makes reference to the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China.
That song has since been pulled from music streaming services in China. 
Some analysts and those in the Hong Kong government fear these weeks of provocation have incensed Beijing and will push it to keep the territory on a tighter leash. 
But many see sustained pressure on their own government and Beijing authorities as the only choice.
""The general consensus at this point is that we are desperate. We don't know if anything we do will help, but we have to keep coming out and keep trying new things,"" Lee said. ""This is our last stand for Hong Kong.""

U.S. help sought in Hong Kong protest,"Congress called on to pass bill punishing those who curtail freedoms
HONG KONG - Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched to the U.S. Consulate here on Sunday to urge American lawmakers to pass legislation in support of the territory's democratic aspirations.
The police-sanctioned rally and march through the city center had the trappings of a Fourth of July parade. Protesters waved American flags, sang the ""Star-Spangled Banner,"" carried red-white-and-blue signs calling on President Trump to ""Liberate Hong Kong"" and chanted ""Free Hong Kong, pass the act!"" 
As in previous demonstrations, violence broke out at the end of the day. By early evening, protesters had vandalized a subway station in central Hong Kong that police had closed and set a fire around one of its entrances. Demonstrators wearing face masks and helmets smashed station windows, leaving glass piled on the sidewalk. They tossed street signs, emptied trash cans down the subway stairwells and began building barricades.
Later Sunday, police fired tear gas to disperse protesters in the popular shopping district of Causeway Bay.
It was the second consecutive night of clashes, despite the decision of Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam to withdraw the widely unpopular extradition bill that sparked the months-long political crisis - a clear sign that her concession has been rejected by pro-democracy protesters.As dissent in Hong Kong and the accompanying police crackdown continue, Lam and her government face the possibility of growing international criticism, particularly from the United States, where lawmakers have returned from their summer recess. 

Authorities have targeted prominent activists who have not been at the forefront of the recent protests. Former student leader Joshua Wong, who is due to visit the United States soon to testify at a congressional hearing, was arrested at the city's airport while returning from Taiwan, he said through a legal representative Sunday evening.
Wong was detained for ""breaching bail conditions"" following his arrest last month but said this was due to mistakes on his bail certificate. He called his detention ""utterly unreasonable"" and said he expected to be released Monday.
Organizers handed a petition to a consulate official calling for swift congressional passage of the bipartisan Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The protest was expected to draw the ire of Beijing, which has accused the United States of meddling in the months-long political crisis and warned that Hong Kong is an internal Chinese matter. 
Members of the Congressional Executive Commission on China reintroduced the bill in June, days after a million people marched to call for the extradition legislation to be scrapped.
In a statement late Sunday, the Hong Kong government said it has ""regret"" about the reintroduction of the act and ""reiterates that foreign legislatures should not interfere in any form in the internal affairs"" of Hong Kong.

The congressional bill would require an annual review of the special treatment afforded by Washington to Hong Kong under the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, including the trade and business privileges Hong Kong enjoys separate from China. It would also direct the administration to freeze the assets and deny U.S. entry to people found to be ""suppressing basic freedoms"" in Hong Kong.
""The Chinese government is breaking their promises to give freedom and human rights to Hong Kong,"" said a 24-year-old protester in a red ""Make America Great Again"" hat.
""We want to use the U.S. to push China to do what they promised over 20 years ago,"" said the man, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""The U.S. government can make China think: Do they really want to lose Hong Kong?"" Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, suspended the extradition bill in mid-June but didn't fully withdraw it until Wednesday. In the weeks between those actions, the protests expanded in intensity and scope to encompass Beijing's erosion of the ""one country, two systems"" framework, under which Hong Kong has operated since Britain handed it back to China in 1997. 
In an indication of the growing anti-China flavor of protests, demonstrators on Sunday carried posters and stickers depicting the Chinese flag with its yellow stars rearranged into swastikas.
Swastikas with the term ""Chinazi"" were spray-painted in the Central district.
Lam's concessions, which also included beefing up an independent police oversight committee, drew hostility among protesters, who want her to meet the four other demands they have laid out.
Her move to withdraw the bill ""was a public relations exercise vis-a-vis Beijing and Washington,"" said Andreas Fulda, a senior fellow at the University of Nottingham's Asia Research Institute and author of a book on efforts at democratization in China. He said Lam ""has every reason to be worried about a strong U.S. response"" when Congress sits again. 
The growing distrust and public animosity toward police was evident again on Sunday. Dozens of officers stopped and searched protesters on a glitzy stretch of luxury shops in the Central district. Bystanders jeered, yelling ""shame,"" and cheered when a group of tactical officers left the area.
On Saturday, demonstrators planned a second ""stress test"" to disrupt transportation to Hong Kong International Airport, but it was thwarted by police. Last weekend, protesters caused massive traffic jams and rail delays to the airport. Police stymied Saturday's effort by stationing officers in riot gear at subway stops and ferry terminals and boarding buses to check for demonstrators.
Demonstrators pushing for a stronger U.S. government response say Washington has several options, including tweaking language in the Hong Kong Policy Act to limit government-to-government interaction and alter the U.S. economic relationship with Hong Kong. 
""We are in a very urgent situation,"" said Cody, a 30-year-old IT worker. ""We need all the support we can get.""
Members of Congress have been watching Hong Kong and discussing legislation through the summer recess. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said last week that lawmakers should move quickly to advance the bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he would support legislation to ""enhance"" the Hong Kong Policy Act he helped to pass in 1992.The push to pass the law has frustrated pro-Beijing lawmakers in Hong Kong. Felix Chung, one such lawmaker, traveled with colleagues to Montana last month to meet with congressmen and senators.
""Traditionally, these bills targeting specific countries, they are developing countries, with dictators in those countries,"" he said. ""But Hong Kong has been so close to the U.S., economically and socially, it has never been a target of the U.S. government, so why should they use such a particular bill to punish Hong Kong?""
While leaders from both parties have been vocal in their support of Hong Kong's protesters, Trump has taken a largely hands-off approach. He said last month that Chinese President Xi Jinping could ""quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem."" Previously, he described the protests as ""riots,"" a term used by Hong Kong authorities and a characterization protesters are fighting to have withdrawn as one of their demands.
Kurt Tong, who served as U.S. consul general in Hong Kong until this summer, said the administration has treated Hong Kong as a ""second-tier"" issue. In a speech in Washington, he said the administration has put more focus on Iran, North Korea and the trade war with China.

"Defying ban in Hong Kong, masked demonstrators march in huge numbers","HONG KONG - Covering their faces with black surgical masks, Guy Fawkes disguises, dish towels and even paper bags, tens of thousands in Hong Kong marched in the territory's two main districts in defiance of a government ban on face masks, despite fears of violence and pouring rain.
The march, which until late afternoon remained peaceful, underscored the depth of dissent over the new measures that many here believe to be an infringement of their fundamental freedoms. Despite a partial shutdown of the city's subway system, including stations close to the starting points of the rallies, participants included the disabled in wheelchairs, toddlers and senior citizens.
""To me, banning the masks is an erosion of our basic rights,"" said 60-year-old Fred Wong as he marched toward central Hong Kong in a green surgical mask. ""We as the older ones should be ashamed of ourselves for not protecting our rights a long time ago, and we should be embarrassed if we don't come out to fight for the future of the young."" 
The size and diversity of the marches showed that many remain undeterred and unwilling to give up their demands for a more democratic Hong Kong, even as the risks of protest continue to increase. 
The Hong Kong government is under growing pressure from authorities in Beijing to quell the anger that has erupted on city streets and end demonstrations that are now in their fifth month. 
Starting at midafternoon, police attempted to disperse the marches in central Hong Kong and in the Kowloon district near Victoria Harbor. Before they started firing tear gas rounds, there had been no confrontations between police and protesters.
Police in the Mongkok neighborhood of Kowloon fired rubber bullets and bean bag rounds at the peaceful crowd. Protesters shined laser lights at them; police escalated to tear gas.
In one particularly dramatic confrontation, a taxi driver in Kowloon appeared to drive deliberately into a crowd of protesters. The crowd pummeled the man, bloodying his face before another group of protesters stepped in to end the attack.
Hong Kong's Hospital Authority said three people were hospitalized in relation to the protests; two were in critical condition.By early evening, a core of more militant protesters geared up for clashes with police, now routine after large marches. Outside the city's High Court building, demonstrators laid bricks down on the road along with traffic cones and metal railings. In what appeared to be a new tactic, they also tied trip wires made of fishing line across a road that has been the scene of charges by police during recent protests. ﻿

Small groups threw petrol bombs and other objects at police. 
Police began clearing the crowds with water cannons and tear gas and started arresting protesters. A spokeswoman for the police department did not immediately provide details on the arrests or whether any were charged under the new anti-mask laws. 
Personnel on the roof of the barracks of the People's Liberation Army in the Kowloon Tong neighborhood raised a yellow flag warning marchers they were breaking the law and could be prosecuted - the first time protesters have elicited a reaction from the Chinese military. Protesters have avoided targeting PLA buildings.
https://twitter.com/hongkongfp/status/1180842014239158272?s=21"">
The Hong Kong government described the protesters Sunday night as ""a large number of masked rioters"" who ""took the opportunities to block roads and vandalize public property, [subway] stations as well as banks and shops selected by the rioters in various areas.""
In a statement, the government said it ""severely condemns these violent acts which totally disregard law and order.""
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam invoked sweeping emergency powers to enact the face mask ban, a measure she said was aimed at calming the violence that has grown through the protests.
The protests were sparked by a proposal to allow extraditions to mainland China. That proposal has been withdrawn, but the unrest has swelled into a movement seeking direct elections for Hong Kong's leaders and an independent investigation into the police. 
Lam's ban on face masks has so far only provoked more anger. Violence on city streets swelled on Friday night, when dozens of businesses perceived as pro-Beijing were vandalized and burned. Some of the same outlets were also targeted on Sunday, along with subway stations, which were badly vandalized.
The city was placed on an effective shutdown on Saturday as the entire subway network, shops and most supermarkets were closed. The subway reopened partially on Sunday but announced it would close all stations at 9 p.m. 
Many here worry that the expanded police powers will only advance a sense of impunity in the department, which has used increasingly harsh tactics to suppress the demonstrations. The presence of riot police has increased throughout the city in recent days; officers are decked out in shields, helmets and sometimes face coverings. 
Protesters have added a new demand: They're for a complete overhaul of the police force.""In Hong Kong, we are seeing the police now covering their faces with black masks, almost like they have unlimited rights,"" said Yeung, 18, who provided only her last name because the march was unauthorized. She said the law ""is being applied with double standards."" 

On Sunday morning, the High Court for the second time rejected a temporary injunction on the anti-mask law, this one filed by a group of two dozen pro-democracy lawmakers. The court will still hear a judicial review of the law and the emergency powers used to implement it and has expedited the case.
""The court obviously sees that there is an important constitutional principle at stake concerning our separation of powers, concerning the rule of law in Hong Kong,"" Dennis Kwok, a pro-democracy lawmaker who represents the legal sector, said after the ruling. ""And that is why the court has agreed to grant us a very fast and quick hearing in the second half of this month.""
Kwok said ""we will do our best to fight whether it is in court, whether it is in [the Legislative Council] or whether it is out there with the Hong Kong people.""
Joy Luk, a protester in her 30s, joined the march in central Hong Kong. Luk, who is blind, has become a familiar participant in the demonstrations, with her caretaker and the phone on which she listens to live streams of the events.
On Sunday, for the first time, she wore a mask.
""I have not worn any face masks to the protest in the past because I don't think my identity would be concealed even if I wear them,"" she said. ""I am probably the only blind person to go to the front lines of protests.
""But now,"" she said, ""it is my means of expression against the government. They cannot stop us.""

"Protesters, police clash at attack site in Hong Kong","Neighborhood draws thousands angered by delayed response to mobs

HONG KONG - Police on Saturday fired tear gas and projectiles in a crowded Hong Kong neighborhood after tens of thousands of defiant protesters gathered to denounce apparent pro-Beijing mobs that went on a violent rampage last weekend.
The protest - in the residential neighborhood of Yuen Long in Hong Kong's New Territories, close to the border with mainland China - was not authorized by police, who cited fears of violence. Clashes left at least 17 people injured.
Yuen Long was the scene of a brazen mob attack on July 21 against anti-government protesters returning from a largely peaceful march. The mobs, which were armed with sticks and batons and carried Chinese flags, are said to be linked to organized crime syndicates known as triads.
Many Hong Kong residents were enraged by the delayed response from police, who did not arrive on the scene for nearly 40 minutes.
Despite the authorities' warnings, protesters showed up in the neighborhood on Saturday, some armed with shields, umbrellas and wearing body armor.
Protesters were seen digging up bricks from sidewalks, which they threw at riot police, and ripping iron poles off railings and removing fencing to build barricades. 
""We are all here to give a message, to tell those who attacked us loud and clear that we are not scared of them,"" said Yam, a 19-year old protester, who only gave his last name, citing the illegality of the demonstration. ""Nothing, nothing will stop us from protesting for our rights.""
Saturday marked the eighth consecutive week of massive demonstrations in Hong Kong, increasingly marred by violence that is raising global concern. The upheaval was sparked by an unpopular extradition bill that would allow fugitives to be sent to China and has continued as the government declined to fully withdraw the proposals.
But the crowd's anger on Saturday was directed at police and the Hong Kong government for their handling of the events of the past weeks - specifically the police's slow response to the mob violence. 
More than 42,000 emergency calls were made to police, who arrived only after the mob had left. Forty-five people were injured, some seriously.
Police blamed their slow response on protests happening in central Hong Kong. They arrested six people involved with the mob violence, but only a day later.
On Saturday, crowds jammed the streets and sidewalks, making it difficult to move at some points. 
Along the march route, apartment residents watched the crowds below from the roofs of their buildings. A banner hanging from one building cursed the Hong Kong police. Groups shouted expletives at and jeered officers.
Protesters also held a mock funeral for Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and Police Commissioner Stephen Lo. 
Another target of protesters' ire was Junius Ho, a pro-Beijing lawmaker from Yuen Long, who appeared in a video that allegedly showed him shaking hands and congratulating men who took part in the mob violence. Earlier in the week, a group trashed his office and defaced his mother's grave. 
Before sundown, there were tense standoffs at multiple points across the neighborhood. Protesters blocked a police van from passing, spray-painting it and smashing the windows. 
Riot police responded with multiple canisters of tear gas, sending a crowd that included elderly women scrambling down an overpass. Clouds of tear gas were so thick that it wafted into high-rise residential apartments. 


Most of the demonstrators had cleared the area by 9 p.m., leaving just a small group of protesters and riot police locked in a brawl at the Yuen Long railway station.
Protesters sprayed multiple fire extinguishers at officers and doused them using water hoses. Riot police surged into the station and tackled demonstrators, leaving trails of blood.
""Hong Kong is our home, it is our freedom to go everywhere. I'm just here exercising my rights,"" said 26-year-old Chen, who turned up with seven friends. She wanted to send a signal of support to protesters and felt ""saddened and shocked"" by the mob attacks. 
Dissent in Hong Kong has also spread among the tens of thousands of civil servants, aviation workers and others. On Friday, a protest was held at Hong Kong's airport, facilitated by groups including the airport workers, airline workers and other aviation staff.

Hong Kongers threaten to rain on China's parade,"But protests in Hong Kong threaten to rain on its parade

BEIJING - The Sharp Sword stealth drones and the intercontinental ballistic missiles and the truck-borne monuments to the Communist struggle are ready. Flowers have been planted and red lanterns hung along all the major thoroughfares of Beijing. Almost 100,000 people have been practicing their formations in Tiananmen Square.
The Communist Party is ready to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1 with the kind of military extravaganza that only Stalinist states can pull off.
It ought to be a particularly sweet anniversary for China's leaders: Their Communist state has now lasted longer than the Soviet Union, which endured for 69 years.
But it is not. The months-long standoff between the party and the millions who have been protesting in Hong Kong is set to come to a head on Oct. 1, when the demonstrators plan to stage a counter-rally.
""A confrontation of monumental proportions is coming up,"" said Orville Schell, a China specialist at the Asia Society. ""Clearly, something will happen on Oct. 1.""
Chinese officials have been going to great lengths to ensure ""stability"" in Beijing on the day of the parade. Homing pigeons and kite-flying have been banned. Airports and train stations are planning extra security checks. 
Local journalists have been told to report only good news, and foreign ones have been told to stay off their office balconies to avoid being shot by snipers. The skies have been ordered to be blue.
But the protests in semiautonomous Hong Kong - and the sympathies they are generating in Taiwan, which Beijing views as a breakaway state - show that not everyone shares President Xi Jinping's ""Chinese Dream.""

Xi, who is presiding over his first of the Communist Party's decennial anniversaries - but maybe not his last, because he removed term limits on leadership - has laid out a vision to revive the Chinese nation and restore it to its rightful place at the center of the world.
Part of this vision involves the reunification of greater China, incorporating Taiwan, which exists as a democratic, pluralistic flip side to the one-party state of the People's Republic.
Another part involves overcoming the ""century of humiliation,"" in which Hong Kong played a significant role. Britain invaded Hong Kong in 1841 at the beginning of the First Opium War, when it forcibly redressed its trade imbalance with China by getting people addicted to the narcotic.
These factors make the expression of a different kind of Chinese dream in Hong Kong and Taiwan inconvenient, to say the least, for the Communist Party.
""There's a kind of counter-dream, one with a more cosmopolitan view of Chinese-ness and a more inclusive view of Chinese-ness that's separate from the Chinese Communist Party but linked up to things that really fit in with the Chinese tradition,"" said Jeffrey Wasserstrom, a historian of modern China at the University of California at Irvine. 
Indeed, the ""Chinese Dream"" has almost zero appeal in Hong Kong, said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political scientist at Hong Kong Baptist University.
""In the past, the Hong Kong and Chinese identities had always been distinct, but they have been diverging since 2012,"" Cabestan said. That was the year mainland Chinese patriotic education, including a book titled ""The China Model,"" extolling the Communist Party, was introduced into Hong Kong schools.
""More and more Chinese young people think that they can't be both,"" Cabestan said. ""They might feel Chinese, but they don't feel PRC. That's why the Chinese Communist Party feels threatened.""
A survey conducted by the University of Hong Kong in June found that the percentage of people who identified as Chinese had fallen to a record low.
Only 11 percent of the 1,015 respondents said they were Chinese. More than half - 53 percent - described themselves as Hong Kongers. Twenty-three percent said they were ""Hongkongers in China."" When asked whether they were proud of being a Chinese national, 71 percent said no. That rose to 90 percent for respondents ages 18 to 29.
 While Hong Kongers say they have felt more distance from the mainland, they say they also have begun to feel closer to Taiwan.
In 2014, Hong Kong and Taiwan saw large-scale demonstrations bristling against Beijing's influence.
Hong Kongers took to the streets in their Umbrella Movement to protest Beijing's increasing intervention in their governance. Young people in Taiwan launched the Sunflower Movement to oppose greater integration with China.
""Since 2014, since the Sunflower and the Umbrella movements, they have felt that they share the same values,"" Cabestan said.
This poses an existential challenge to Xi, whose top priority is the perpetuation of Communist Party rule over a rejuvenated greater China.
In the years since Hong Kong's return from British control in 1997, Beijing had held up the territory as an example of what the future could hold for Taiwan: a vibrant Chinese territory with a degree of autonomy. 
Hong Kong held the promise of how the ""one country, two systems"" framework could work for Taiwan.
But since 2014, that promise has begun to look more like a threat.
""With the Umbrella Movement, the protesters in Hong Kong began to say: 'Look Taiwan, Hong Kong today could be Taiwan tomorrow,' but in a warning sense,"" Wasserstrom said.
Now, five years on from those protests - and five years of increasingly authoritarian leadership under Xi - young people in Hong Kong and Taiwan are finding more concerns in common.
After the Hong Kong protests began in June, demonstrators in Taiwan took to the streets chanting ""Taiwan cheng Hong Kong,"" using the Mandarin word for ""support."" 
Then musicians from Taiwan and Hong Kong joined forces to release a song called ""Cheng."" ""The dark night is falling, but I will keep you company. The rain pours down heavy and hard, but cannot drown our dream,"" the lyrics go. ""Let us hold up the umbrella, never give in, never back down.""
The situation is clearly uncomfortable for Beijing.
As if to show that ""one country, two systems"" can work, the party plastered photos of Xi and the next chief executive of Macao, a Chinese special administrative region like Hong Kong, over the front page of its mouthpiece, the People's Daily.
When Ho Iat Seng visited Beijing this month, Xi said Macao, which was handed back to China by Portugal two years after Hong Kong, showed that the principle of ""one country, two systems"" was ""completely feasible, and can be achieved and well received with people.""
For his part, Ho emphasized the ""one country"" part of the formulation and said he would work to make sure the casino state became further integrated ""into the nation's development."" He encouraged young Macanese to work on the mainland.
Communist Party leaders have condemned the violence of some of the protests and accused Western countries of fomenting the unrest. But they have stopped short of direct action. 
They have publicized military training on Hong Kong's borders and at the Hong Kong garrison of the People's Liberation Army, which reports to the party. But apparently conscious of the international criticism that would follow military action and the effect on Hong Kong as a financial center, they have shown restraint.
The big question now is whether, after the spectacle of Oct. 1, Beijing will be less worried about the optics of action.

Hong Kong police face intense public criticism,"Force has become isolated and embattled amid rising violence 

HONG KONG - The 29-year-old police officer was nearing the 24th hour of his shift last month, standing with his unit between a throng of protesters and Hong Kong's most important government building, when the order came down: It was time to escalate.
Edward suited up. He donned his gas mask as officers readied tear-gas canisters.
The stinging clouds came thick and fast, along with rounds of rubber bullets. The crowd scattered. Officers rushed young masked protesters, thumping them with batons.
He did not want to follow those orders on June 12. This was not the side he wanted to be on.
Five years ago, Edward was camped out with other protesters on Hong Kong streets, calling for free elections. Those demonstrations failed to achieve their aims but invigorated a generation of young activists frustrated by China's refusal to grant the semiautonomous city full democracy.
This time, Edward - who joined the force in 2015 because of the relatively high salaries - has been an officer stationed on the front lines of almost every major protest during weeks of anti-government demonstrations in Hong Kong.
""I didn't expect I would ever be standing opposite to the action,"" said Edward, who asked to be identified by only his first name because he was not authorized to speak to the media. ""I understand the protesters. Really, I feel like I am one of them.""
Once known as ""Asia's Finest,"" the Hong Kong Police Force has been caught between a furious public - angered by officials' plans to allow extraditions to mainland China - and Hong Kong's pro-Beijing government.
The police have faced intense criticism of their tactics, from the use of tear gas and rubber bullets to tardiness in responding to emergency calls when an armed gang attacked people returning from a demonstration late Sunday.
Top brass now must contend with a force that feels isolated and embattled, a public that has grown increasingly hostile toward police, and younger officers like Edward who say they are shocked and saddened by the force's actions and no longer want to do the job.
Some are thinking of leaving the force and are bracing for escalating violence in Hong Kong, according to current and former officers and security experts.
On Wednesday, China declined to rule out using troops in attempts to quell the unrest in Hong Kong, where protesters days earlier vandalized the Chinese government's liaison office.
China's Defense Ministry spokesman, Wu Qian, said it was ""intolerable"" that protesters appeared to challenge China's sovereignty over Hong Kong. He noted that the People's Liberation Army garrison operates under a law that would mobilize troops to restore public order if requested by the Hong Kong government.
Concern for the police
A rare show of support for the force came Saturday when more than 100,000 people rallied to urge respect and praise for the police and sympathy for their handling of the political upheaval on the streets.
Dozens of relatives of police officers penned an open letter to Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and her government, saying they were ""overwhelmed by feelings of fury and distress.""
Police ""have to follow certain orders from their superiors that are illogical, go against common sense and put their lives in jeopardy,"" the relatives wrote.
In a meeting with police leadership, police associations demanded tougher measures against protesters, including the use of water cannons and colored pepper spray to ""mark"" protesters on the front lines. They called for a new law to prohibit demonstrators from covering their faces with masks.
""Safety of the police should be the priority,"" they said in a summary of the meeting, the text of which was provided to The Washington Post.
The appeals and support came after police and protesters clashed July 14 in a shopping mall. Several officers, including one who had part of his finger bitten off during a scuffle with a protester, were among almost two dozen people hurt.
Riot police have found themselves overwhelmed and on the defensive on several occasions during two months of unrest. Edward said fellow front-line officers
have to work shifts of
24 to 36 hours, with little rest or tactical planning before protests and without clear objectives.
""Officers are going crazy from the long hours,"" he said. ""There is a complete lack of training. We have never faced this kind of situation before.""
'Operational failure'
The pockets of support for the police, however, were quickly overshadowed by a new slew of condemnation toward the force after another evening of chaos and violence on Sunday.
Ahead of an anti-government march, police had taken great precautions to barricade government buildings targeted in previous protests, including the police headquarters, the Legislative Council building and other offices. Thousands more officers were deployed, and the planned route of the march was shortened.
Yet protesters once again outmaneuvered police. They marched west beyond the government buildings and on to Beijing's liaison office, which they vandalized and defaced, provoking anger from Chinese authorities.
Throughout the protests, police ""have been taken by surprise,"" said Clement Lai, who was a member of the force for 22 years and its superintendent and now runs a private security firm. ""Their opponents have learned from their failures before. They've learned police tactics, but the police are lacking imagination.""
As riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters after a standoff at the liaison office, another scene was unfolding 20 miles away: Hundreds of white-shirted thugs, wielding sticks and batons, descended on the Yuen Long subway station to pummel protesters returning from the march. Not a single police officer was on site. Gates at the local police station were shuttered, and emergency phone lines were overwhelmed.
Two officers had initially responded to the mob violence in Yuen Long but assessed that the situation was too dangerous for them to enter without protective gear, Police Commissioner Stephen Lo said Monday. Lo said the police station's gates were shuttered for ""safety"" and explained that police were stretched because they had been dealing with the protest on Hong Kong Island and couldn't respond quickly.
The two officers returned with reinforcements about 20 minutes later. By then, 45 people were injured, some critically, and the mob had retreated to a nearby village.
""This has absolutely been a public relations failure, and an operational failure,"" Lai said. ""We ex-cops are frustrated, too. It seems like 175 years of professionalism has just gone down the drain.""
Finding a way out
After Sunday's mob violence, memes and cartoons have cropped up depicting a chummy relationship between police and the Yuen Long attackers, who are widely suspected to have links to organized crime groups known as triads.
Edward doesn't mind the memes. But he said he is most upset that his fellow officers were unable to keep Hong Kongers safe, and that they continue to launch aggressive clearance operations against protesters.
He finds himself wrestling with a painful internal question: How can he continue to crack down on people with whom he sympathizes?
He remembers how he felt during the 2014 protests, known as the Umbrella Movement, and still believes now what he did then - that it is ""everyone's responsibility to struggle and fight for a democratic society.""
""The government hasn't done anything to solve the chaos in our society,"" he said. ""I understand citizens are angry, and I'm prepared for the bad feelings I have to face from them as a police officer.""
He is planning to quit the force and says some other young officers also want to leave. Whether he has another job or not, he won't stay past mid-2020. After all, he said, he never wanted to be a police officer - aiming instead for the fire department or immigration - but it was the highest-paying job he could get at the time. Edward never studied at a university.
""I am looking forward to when I don't have to look at the protesters face-to-face anymore,"" he said. ""And I can go back to being a part of them.""

Airport clashes raise stakes in Hong Kong protests,"HONG KONG - Riot police armed with pepper spray and batons clashed with protesters late Tuesday at Hong Kong's airport, bringing violence to the key international hub while passengers were stranded inside after many departing flights were canceled.
The police intervened after a frenzied mob of protesters seized a man, claiming he was an undercover Chinese police officer, and blocked paramedics from transporting him for hours after he lost consciousness. Later Tuesday night, the group seized a second Chinese man, identified by his documents and his editor as a reporter for the Global Times, the Chinese Communist Party-run newspaper.
Arrivals and departures returned to normal Wednesday morning Hong Kong time. Also Wednesday, Hong Kong's airport authority said it had obtained a court order to prevent people from obstructing the terminal or participating in any protest at the airport other than in a designated area.

On Tuesday afternoon, President Trump weighed in, tweeting: ""Our Intelligence has informed us that the Chinese Government is moving troops to the Border with Hong Kong. Everyone should be calm and safe!"" He did not elaborate, and it is not clear whether he based the tweet on new information or on widely circulated reports Monday about Chinese armored personnel carriers massing on the Hong Kong-China border.
The incidents marked a brazen escalation by protesters in confronting those they perceive as infiltrators from mainland China and capped a second consecutive day of chaos at Hong Kong International Airport, normally among the busiest in the world. Authorities have not been able to quell months of protests in the city, a global financial hub. 
After mass cancellations Monday evening, flights had been gradually returning to normal throughout Tuesday, even as thousands of black-clad demonstrators returned to occupy parts of the airport, carrying placards denouncing police brutality and calling for freedom for Hong Kong.But by late afternoon, with protesters using luggage carts as makeshift barricades and blocking passengers from reaching the departure gates, causing long lines, authorities said they were suspending check-in at both of the airport's terminals. 
Arguments erupted between frustrated passengers and protesters, with some stranded passengers crying and saying they just wanted to get home.
A more disturbing scene began taking shape later in the day when a group of protesters surrounded a man they believed to be an undercover police officer from Shenzhen, the Chinese city across the border from Hong Kong. There was no confirmation of the man's identity or employment, but the protesters tied his hands and did not let him move or leave for hours. 
Those closest to the melee held their phones aloft and tried to film the struggling man, while some jeered and laughed at him. Protesters held a handmade sign over the man that read in English, ""I am China's police. I pretend to be protester,"" as he appeared to struggle to remain conscious.
Police entered the airport to help the man. The presence of officers sparked chaos, with protesters spilling out of the airport building and attacking vans carrying police officers. 
At one point, an officer was overwhelmed and his baton taken by protesters, who beat him with it. The group retreated only after the officer appeared to pull his pistol from its holster.
After the standoff with police, a second man was apprehended by protesters and bound to a luggage cart with cable ties. Protesters took away his passport, bank cards and other personal documents and scattered them on the floor. The documents identified him as a reporter at the Global Times, a nationalist tabloid. 
Hu Xijin, the newspaper's editor in chief, confirmed on Twitter that the second man seized by protesters was a reporter for the Chinese state outlet. 
 ""I affirm this man being tied in this video is the reporter himself,"" Hu said. ""He has no other task except for reporting. I sincerely ask the demonstrators to release him. I also ask for help of West reporters.""
Trump on Tuesday described the developments in Hong Kong as a ""very tough situation.""
""I hope it works out for everybody, including China, by the way,"" Trump told reporters. ""I hope nobody gets hurt. I hope nobody gets killed.""
The State Department urged China to adhere to its commitment to allow ""a high degree of autonomy"" in Hong Kong - part of an agreement under which Britain relinquished its former colony. ""We condemn violence and urge all sides to exercise restraint, but remain staunch in our support for freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly in Hong Kong,"" the State Department said, adding that the protests reflect ""broad concerns about the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy.""
The demonstration at the airport started as a peaceful protest against police use of force. Chants of ""Return the eye!"" broke out - a reference to an incident Sunday night when a young woman was shot in the eye, possibly with a bean bag round, during a clash between police and protesters. Senior officers said Tuesday they were unsure how the woman was injured.
Roving teams of protesters handed snacks to stranded passengers and appealed for understanding as they distributed pamphlets detailing their case against police brutality. Others bowed repeatedly and said ""sorry"" without yielding their ground in the face of angry passengers.
Police said they were closely monitoring the situation at the airport, working with airport authorities, and would carefully consider the need to use force.
Pavol Cacara, a Slovakian machinery importer who faced off with protesters, said his flight to Istanbul was canceled once already. 
""You cannot make freedom by taking freedom from others!"" he bellowed, shaking with rage, at a mass of young demonstrators in black T-shirts. ""This is what the Chinese want you to do, to make you lose support of the world. You are helping them!""
Statements from Chinese government officials and state media had grown steadily more shrill before Tuesday, accusing protesters of ""terrorism"" and warning of an impending crackdown in the semiautonomous financial center.
The political crisis, triggered by now-suspended plans to allow extraditions to mainland China, has grown as residents of Hong Kong demand the extradition bill's full withdrawal, an independent inquiry into police actions toward protesters, greater democracy and an amnesty for those arrested in clashes between demonstrators and police. 
The upheaval has come at a politically sensitive time for Chinese leader Xi Jinping, ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which the Communist Party plans to mark with a military parade in October.Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's leader, said the city was in danger of being ""pushed into an abyss"" and warned that it could be ""smashed to pieces.""
International calls grew, meanwhile, for authorities in Hong Kong and China to dial back tensions.
U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet urged authorities to immediately investigate police use of force in the recent crackdown on protests.

Chris Patten, the last British governor of colonial Hong Kong before the city's return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, warned that a Chinese intervention would be a ""catastrophe"" for both Hong Kong and China. 
Speaking to BBC radio, he urged Lam and Xi to find a way to bring people together.
""There is a degree of frustration and anger at the government refusing to give any sensible ground at all,"" Patten said, ""which probably provokes more violence.""

China leaks U.S. diplomat's personal information to paper in Hong Kong,"U.S. decries 'thuggish' act as Beijing lashes out over continuing protests

BEIJING - After weeks of escalating warnings alleging a covert U.S. role behind the protests in Hong Kong, the tone in Communist Party-backed media outlets is turning darkly acrimonious, with publications attacking a U.S. diplomat in Hong Kong and releasing her personal information.
The pro-Beijing newspaper Ta Kung Pao on Thursday published a photo of opposition activists meeting in a hotel with Julie Eadeh, a political section chief at the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong, along with details of Eadeh's State Department career and the names of her husband and teenage children.
The report, which was recirculated by Chinese state media, emerged as Beijing doubled down on a familiar strategy of framing the nine-week-long protests as a U.S. intelligence plot to spark a ""color revolution"" to destabilize China.
The publication of information about the diplomat drew a furious response from the State Department, which accused China of ""thuggish"" behavior. U.S. diplomats around the world often meet with opposition figures and groups, occasionally drawing rebukes from governments.
The unusual pinpoint attack on the diplomat in Hong Kong underscores China's growing frustration over the protests and their anti-Beijing message.
On Friday, hundreds of protesters flooded into Hong Kong's airport terminal to stage another sit-in and vowed to continue it through the weekend. The territory's embattled leader, Carrie Lam, made a fresh appeal to the public by citing the economic toll of the disturbances.
Lam said she had met with a broad section of society - entrepreneurs, doctors, teachers - and believed that a ""violent minority"" of protesters ""had no stake in society.""
China's aviation overseer, meanwhile, ordered Hong Kong's flagship carrier Cathay Pacific Airways to suspend any personnel who take part in or support the protests.
In Beijing, the propaganda attacks pillorying the United States were not aimed at Washington. But they represented a classic Communist Party influence effort to shore up public opinion in Hong Kong, said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at SOAS University of London.
After the first month of protests - when authorities in Beijing censored all mention of record-breaking crowds surging into Hong Kong's streets to oppose an extradition bill - Chinese state television began to flood the airwaves with scenes of protesters in Hong Kong clashing violently with police and defacing China's national emblem and flag.
""That is exactly what they would call the United Front approach. We would call it divide and rule,"" Tsang said, referring to the Communist Party wing that is responsible for political influence campaigns in China and abroad. ""They want to isolate the protesters from the bulk of the Hong Kong population and say, 'This is all about foreign interference.' ""
With few good options to swiftly restore order to Hong Kong's streets, the Communist Party was urgently looking to cement its ties to political allies in the city and ""win over the wavering middle,"" Tsang said.
In 2014, pro-government media sought to isolate Hong Kong protesters waging a civil disobedience campaign called Occupy Central. At the time, pro-Beijing social media accounts floated theories that protest leaders were receiving military training from the CIA, said Yuen Chan, a lecturer at City University of London.
But the tactic may encounter more resistance this time around, Chan said.
The 2014 movement, which sought broader voting rights, was ""a much more polarizing issue compared to this year, when there is so much consensus within Hong Kong society,"" Chan said.
Since early June, the protests have drawn millions of people onto the city's streets, including first-time demonstrators, white-collar professionals, retirees and civil servants. What began as opposition to a proposal for extraditions from Hong Kong to the mainland has bloomed into anger against what many see as an out-of-touch Hong Kong government, a heavy-handed police force and the growing encroachment of the Communist Party leadership in Beijing.
The Chinese government has maintained its support for Lam, dismissed the protests as the work of an extreme minority and escalated its rhetoric against Washington. A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman in Beijing this month criticized U.S. officials such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and warned that ""those who play with fire will
be self-immolated.""
After the Ta Kung Pao article, State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus described China's behavior as irresponsible.
""I don't think leaking an American diplomat's private information, pictures, names of their children - I don't think that is a formal protest. That is what a thuggish regime would do,"" Ortagus told reporters in Washington late Thursday. ""American diplomats meet with formal government officials; we meet with opposition protesters, not just in Hong Kong or China. This literally happens in every single country.""
Joshua Wong, one of the pro-democracy activists who were pictured meeting with Eadeh, said on Facebook that he met with the consulate to discuss a bill in the U.S. Congress and to seek a ban on exports of U.S.-made tear gas to Hong Kong police.

Hong Kong leader officially withdraws extradition bill,"But protesters' concerns have moved beyond the controversial measure
HONG KONG - After months of clashes and chaos, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced an end Wednesday to the extradition bill that touched off the territory's worst political crisis since its handover to China. The reply from protesters and even pro-government officials was swift and sharp: Too little, too late.
The dueling messages - an olive branch from Lam and a rebuff from opponents - suggest little hope for a breakthrough to ease the increasingly violent confrontations playing out on Hong Kong's streets.
That is because the protests have gone far beyond the now-dead bill to allow extradition to mainland China. The dissent has grown into a broad base that includes shopkeepers, civil servants, students and others fearing that Hong Kong's freedoms and special status within China are in jeopardy.
And Lam's move was widely seen as falling short on many fronts - including failing to address the deep concerns over the expanding use of force by riot police.
Meanwhile, representatives from Lam's cabinet say their hands are tied in doing much more. That will probably extend the tumult ahead of Oct. 1 events to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
Protesters have threatened huge demonstrations in Hong Kong to mark the day - which could be a major embarrassment to China's state-run celebrations.
""We should all think deeply whether escalating violence and disturbances is the answer,"" Lam said in her speech Wednesday before announcing four steps that she would take to kick-start a dialogue with the public, notably a full withdrawal of the extradition bill. That process will start once the legislature meets again in October, Lam added. 
But some groups quickly turned their backs on the offer.
Several protest leaders - in masks and hard hats - held their own news conference and called Lam's moves insufficient.
Since spring, the demonstrations have grown into a general revolt against China's hand in Hong Kong affairs. Protesters fear that Beijing plans to further roll back Hong Kong's political and social openness under the ""one country, two systems"" accord in which Britain handed back control in 1997.
But protesters also have set a specific five-point list that includes a long-held aspiration to allow Hong Kong voters a direct say in electing their leaders. Lam has addressed just one - and perhaps the easiest - of the five demands.
As her address played on social media, a flood of comments coming in said: ""Five demands! Not one less!"" 
""Hong Kongers will not be satisfied by a partial victory, and our thirst for freedom and justice will not be quenched,"" said one of the masked protesters at the news conference. ""Five demands, not one less"" is not a slogan, she added, but a ""joint consensus.""
Lam stopped short of announcing a fully independent investigation into the upheavals, including the police's response and use of force. Police have arrested almost 1,200 people on protest-related charges.
Protesters also want amnesty for those arrested. The Hong Kong police have been the only authority tasked with suppressing the protests and related violence, despite threats of military intervention from Beijing.
After meeting with her cabinet, pro-Beijing lawmakers and others in the government, Lam said in a televised address that the clashes have ""shocked and saddened people."" 
Her other steps included beefing up Hong Kong's independent police watchdog, known as the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC), and ordering it to look into the force's handling of protests and organized-crime-linked attacks against protesters in July. 
Lam said she would also reach out to the community to start a ""direct dialogue"" with people and task experts, including academics, to independently ""examine and review society's deep-seated problems and to advise the government on finding solutions.""

Protesters deeply distrust the IPCC, which is headed by the former chairman of the city's Securities and Futures Commission, Anthony Francis Neoh, who was appointed to the top position by Lam in 2018.
Protesters believe that the body, which monitors and reviews complaints against members of the Hong Kong police, is stacked with Lam loyalists and cannot be impartial. The body is also unable to summon witnesses. 
It was the possibility of being extradited to face the justice system in mainland China that sparked the massive demonstrations. Lam had previously announced that she would suspend work on the bill and later termed it ""dead,"" but protesters wanted it completely withdrawn, fearing she could restart it later in her term.

Regina Ip, a member of Hong Kong's Executive Council and a pro-Beijing lawmaker, said she believes Lam has responded to a ""centerpiece"" demand from protesters. 
""There are no more concessions we can make,"" she said in an interview. ""I hope people can recognize that our government is working hard to meet the aspirations of the people.""Michael Tien, a pro-Beijing lawmaker who also serves as a Hong Kong delegate to the National People's Congress in China, said resistance to concessions has come in part from Beijing, which is concerned ""it will send a signal to everybody in Hong Kong that the baby who cries the most will get the milk."" 
He added that while fully withdrawing the bill was the ""right thing"" to do, it was probably too late to have an impact. 
""The focus since the beginning of July has completely shifted now to the confrontation between police and rioters and how the public perceives it,"" he said. ""The public is totally polarized, but it is no longer about the extradition bill."" 
Tien added that if grievances between the police and the public are not addressed, ""people are going to be carrying around this hatred for many years.""
Lam, those familiar with her thinking say, fears a negative response from the police force if she were to open such an investigation. 
Political crises have erupted periodically in the semiautonomous territory, however, over fears that the Chinese government is seeking to exercise greater control, most recently in 2014 when Beijing rejected full universal suffrage for Hong Kong. 
Protests have taken on an increasingly anti-Chinese flavor - the national emblem has been defaced, the Chinese flag flung into Victoria Harbor and other symbols of Beijing's control targeted. 
On Telegram, the encrypted messaging app used by protesters to help organize demonstrations, Lam's decision was met with resistance and anger. Some forwarded a quote from ""Winter on Fire,"" a documentary film about Ukraine's 2014 anti-government protests: ""If we accept the government's demands, those who have died will not forgive us.""
Hong Kong stocks surged on the reports that the bill would be formally withdrawn, closing up nearly 4 percent.
Some fear, however, that the crisis has fundamentally eroded business confidence in Hong Kong and revealed the extent of Beijing's ability to pressure even multinational corporations in the city. Jasper Tsang, a former senior official in the Hong Kong government who continues to be a confidant and adviser to Lam, said in an interview Tuesday that concessions aside, the crisis has already done serious damage to Hong Kong. 
""It is not easy to make a full assessment yet,"" he said. ""And even after the violent protest stops, it will take some time, a lot of patience, a lot of hard work to pick up the pieces and put them back together if we can.""

""Humpty Dumpty has fallen,"" he added. ""We don't know whether we can put the broken pieces back together.""

What the unrest in Hong Kong means for the future of Taiwan,"The demonstrators in Hong Kong who rallied against a controversial extradition bill scored several victories against the Chinese Communist Party, beyond the decision by the city's leader to suspend the bill.
The protests illustrated how fearful people in Hong Kong are about the erosion of the idea of ""one country, two systems."" Formulated by China's leader Deng Xiaoping in the early 1980s, the concept of freedom and autonomy for the island is on life support. And as a solution for the hoped-for unification with Taiwan, that formula is already dead.
The extradition law is part of China's campaign to silence its perceived enemies around the world and conscript foreign nations in this endeavor. But the inability of the Hong Kong government to pass it will set back China's efforts to convince Western democracies to reach similar agreements. Only three Western democracies - France, Spain and Portugal - have extradition agreements with China. Australia refused in 2017, and few others are expected now to sign up.
Hong Kong's massive marches against what is clearly viewed as Beijing's overreach also stand as a clear reminder of the danger even a partially free society, such as Hong Kong, poses to an authoritarian state such as China. No wonder Communist Party mouthpieces such as the Global Times are now blaming the United States for masterminding the rallies, while Communist Party supporters, such as George Lung Chee-ming, a prominent Hong Kong insurance executive, are publicly describing the students who are leading the demonstrations as ""sick.""
The original impetus for the extradition legislation was a Valentine's Day 2018 murder in Taiwan, allegedly perpetrated by a Hong Kong man on vacation with his girlfriend. According to the police, the man strangled his girlfriend, stuffed her body in a suitcase and dumped it near a train station before returning to Hong Kong. Back home, he reportedly admitted to the crime, but the authorities could not extradite him to Taiwan to stand trial because the two territories don't have an agreement. Instead, Hong Kong prosecuted him for a lesser offense, money laundering, and on April 29, a Hong Kong court sentenced him to 29 months in jail, with the chance for an early release in October.
The authorities in Hong Kong used the killing to push a bill that would allow Hong Kong to hand over alleged criminals not just to Taiwan but also to China. This sparked fears in Hong Kong that the new law would be exploited by China to prosecute Hong Kong-based political dissidents, journalists and business executives from any country suspected of breaking Chinese laws. Communist Chinese legal authorities have a long history of ginning up bogus cases against people they don't like. So having such a law on the books could have a chilling effect on anyone in Hong Kong who criticizes China or has a dispute with the authorities or businesses there.
How China treats Hong Kong is important for the fate of Taiwan, an island of 23 million, which boasts a robust democracy, a lively press and a dynamic civil society. China claims that Taiwan is one of its provinces and has announced that it wants to use the ""one country, two systems"" model to unite with Taiwan. But China is widely viewed as having already violated that promise.
China has stymied attempts in Hong Kong to directly elect the territory's top leader, called the chief executive, sparking a round of massive protests in 2014. Under China's supervision, the Hong Kong government outlawed a political party and jailed political activists. China has even dispatched security agents to Hong Kong to kidnap a Chinese businessman who ran afoul of authorities on the mainland, along with booksellers who published or sold books critical of Communist Party officials.
Around Taiwan, China's apparent violation of the terms of its agreement with Hong Kong has sparked widespread criticism. On June 9, as people marched in Hong Kong, Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, vowed on her Twitter account that ""as long as I'm President, 'one country, two systems' will never be an option.""

The protests in Hong Kong already seem to be strengthening Tsai's hand. In January, the opposition Nationalist Party, which has generally been closer to China, did well in a midterm election. But on June 13, Tsai's pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party nominated her to run for reelection next January. A few weeks ago, it had appeared as though she was going to face a tougher primary, given her party's defeat earlier this year.
Tsai's potential opponents have been ham-handed in their response. When asked by reporters, one candidate from the Nationalist Party, Han Kuo-yu, pleaded ignorance about what he called the Hong Kong ""parade."" Another candidate, Terry Gou, has labeled China's ""one country, two systems"" a failure, but Gou's firm, the Taiwan manufacturer Foxconn, has invested so much money in China that he has left himself open to allegations that he is too close to Beijing.
The Nationalist Party will choose its candidate in July. But the stage has already been set for yet another backlash against candidates in Taiwan who are perceived to be too close to China - and that could lead to another major defeat for Beijing.

"Global protests share themes of economic anger, hopelessness","Something's going on. From Baghdad to Hong Kong, Santiago, Chile, to Barcelona, cities around the world have seen major protests over recent weeks.
Some of these protests have earned comparisons to the Arab Spring that rocked the Middle East from the end of 2010. But at the same time, they're far broader in geographic range, with countries in Latin America, Europe and Asia experiencing demonstrations.
In a number of these cities, there have been deaths: At least 165 people were killed in the latest round of protests in the Iraqi capital, which resumed this week. Global protests are also causing unease among financial investors, adding to uncertainty about the health of the global economy.
And the reasons for them have been varied. Protests in Hong Kong, for example, were sparked by the local government saying it would allow extraditions to mainland China, while in Lebanon, a proposed tax on calls on the messaging service WhatsApp prompted people to take to the streets.
But there are also startling similarities among some of the protests: themes of economic anger and political hopelessness.
Small factors spark protests 
Lebanon isn't the only country where a single, isolated change sparked protests.
Demonstrations began in Ecuador this month when the government scrapped decades-old fuel subsidies. (Notably, concern over fuel prices also fed the ongoing ""yellow vest"" protest movement in France.) In Chile, an increase in prices on the subway led to violence this month, while the price of onions led to protests in India shortly before.
In almost every case, protests soon turned into something far broader. 
Backtracking on the changes has stopped protests in some countries, but in many, they continue: In Chile, demonstrators persisted last weekend even after the president canceled the planned fare increase.
Inequality causing pain
Income inequality seems to have added an economic insecurity that helped lead to anger and protests.
Lebanon, where the WhatsApp tax caused huge protests, is one of the world's most unequal economies, with the richest 1 percent claiming 25 percent of the total national income between 2005 and 2014.
Chile, in many ways a more stable and prosperous country than many of its neighbors, has the highest level of post-tax income inequality among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, some of the wealthiest nations in the world.
Skewed demographics also make things worse. In Iraq, anger grows among a generation that seems to have poor economic prospects. According to data compiled by the World Bank last year, it is estimated that unemployment is 36 percent among Iraqis who are 15 to 24 years old.
""They stole our futures, and now they're killing us,"" one young man said at a protest in Baghdad early this month.
Deep economic problems 
Income inequality is hardly the only economic factor that many of the countries seeing protests are facing. In particular, slowing economic growth and increasing government debt are pushing policymaking to the brink and leading to fears about the future.
Last week, the International Monetary Fund warned that global economic growth would be 3 percent this year, rather than the 3.2. percent it had predicted in July. If accurate, that will be the slowest growth rate since the previous financial crisis.
That effect is pronounced in some Latin American countries, where the IMF predicts 0.2 percent growth overall, with major economies such as Brazil and Mexico growing at less than 1 percent. 
Just a few years ago, high commodities prices helped lead to a boom in countries like Ecuador, which produces oil, that are now seeing protests.
Many nations borrowed big in the boom times only to find themselves now facing calls from creditors. Lebanon is a particularly extreme situation, where a ratio of debt to gross domestic product of 155 percent makes it the third-most-indebted country in the world.
Little faith in government
Crucially, for many protesters, the issue isn't just government policies: It's the government.
One factor in the anger in Lebanon has been reports that Prime Minister Saad Hariri gave $16 million to a South African model with whom he was romantically involved. Protests in Haiti partially stem from allegations that President Jovenel Moïse's government stole billions of dollars meant for social development projects
In Barcelona and Hong Kong, anger over government legitimacy goes far beyond corruption. Hong Kong protesters no longer believe that their government is able to stand up to Beijing; in Barcelona, last week's protests were prompted by the sentencing of Catalan separatist leaders.
These broader questions of legitimacy help explain why so many protests don't end when the initial problems that led demonstrators to the streets are reversed. Hong Kong suspended the plans for a new extradition law in September; similar policy reversals have yet to stop protests in Lebanon, Ecuador or Chile.
So far, this broad range of protests hasn't brought down a government, though in some places they are coming close. The costs, not only in economic loss, but also in blood, could still rise exponentially.

"To many in Hong Kong, police are just soldiers of Beijing","As esteem sinks in city, officers are reveredin mainland China
HONG KONG - Among the Hong Kong guests invited to a lavish military parade in Beijing celebrating China's National Day were the usual suited tycoons and pro-China politicians - and then there was a bald man who has become familiar on both sides of the border: Sgt. Lau Chak-Kei of the Hong Kong police. 
Lau, 46, is despised by many in Hong Kong for pointing a shotgun loaded with beanbag rounds at protesters outside a police station on July 30, in an early and pivotal moment of an escalating use of force that shocked the global financial hub. He was berated by Hong Kong residents, received prank calls to his home and had his picture plastered on ""Lennon Walls"" across the city. The incident, however, gave Lau hero status in mainland China as a defender of law and order in the face of foreign-backed troublemakers: He was invited to prime-time television shows, flooded with messages of support on Chinese social media and given red-carpet treatment when he arrived in Beijing for the parade. He was given preferential access to the Great Wall of China along with nine other officers and hiked it with the Chinese flag held firmly in his right hand. The state press was there to cover it.
The contrasting reactions to Lau after the incident underscore a new reality for the Hong Kong Police Force. It is seen here increasingly as an occupying force, an arm of Beijing tasked with crushing the city's freedoms. In Beijing, the Hong Kong police are seen as saviors and protectors of Chinese unity. 
For many protesters, China's warnings of military intervention are immaterial, as are fears of another Tiananmen-style crackdown. The oppressors are already here, in this view, and they are the Hong Kong police. 
The situation appears likely to worsen after officers fired live rounds at protesters Tuesday. Protests broke out in several areas of the city Wednesday, the first in central Hong Kong during the lunch hour, apparently involving office workers in the city's financial district. At night, demonstrators gathered in at least three areas, calling for the police force to be disbanded. In Tsuen Wan, where a police officer shot a teenager a day earlier, police fired tear gas at protesters who had occupied roads and thrown gasoline bombs. In one area, protesters invaded a subway station and vandalized it.
Some analysts now warn that this could be the start of years of unrest, and they worry it could deteriorate into the kind of protracted violence and radicalism that roiled places such as Northern Ireland in decades past.Police actions in recent months have ""profoundly damaged their standing in Hong Kong society while at the same time being utterly inefficient in the goal of actually curbing the protests,"" said Mike Chinoy, who covered the conflict in Northern Ireland as a journalist and is now a Hong Kong-based nonresident senior fellow at the University of Southern California's U.S.-China Institute.
A lack of political leadership, as well as mixed signals early on from police brass, meant that the ""Hong Kong police were being asked to solve on the street what is essentially a political problem,"" Chinoy added. 
While Lau was taking in the military firepower on display in Beijing - with a temporary tattoo of the Chinese flag on his hand - Hong Kong was descending into a new level of chaos. Despite warnings of violence and threats of arrest, protesters - peaceful ones and those looking for a fight - gathered in half a dozen locations across the city. 
With placards and chants, they rejected the notion that their semiautonomous city is anything like mainland China, pushed back against Beijing's control and demanded free, direct elections for city leaders. Protests were sparked in June by a bill to allow extraditions to mainland China, but they have swelled into an all-out rebuke of Hong Kong's political system, in which leaders are handpicked by and answerable to Beijing. Demonstrators are pushing five demands, including an independent investigation of the police, but the government has responded only to the first demand, the full withdrawal of the extradition bill. 
A new escalation came when a riot officer shot an 18-year-old at close range in the upper body, apparently after the protester hit him with a bamboo stick, according to police and a video of the melee. After he was shot and as he was lying wounded on the ground, surrounded by officers, a separate video showed another protester flinging a molotov cocktail at the group of police officers. 
Upon hearing about the shooting, prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong said in a tweet: ""The true lesson Beijing learnt from 30yrs ago is, perhaps, to ask someone else to undertake the butcher role,"" a reference to the use of Chinese army troops to crush the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy sit-in.
According to police, 1,400 rounds of tear gas were fired Tuesday, compared with just 150 canisters used in the June 12 protest. In addition, police fired about 900 rubber bullets and six live rounds. At least 269 people were arrested, raising the total detained to more than 2,000.
The Hong Kong Police Force was quick to defend the officer who shot the teenage protester, saying he feared for his life.
""Our National Day is supposed to be a day to celebrate and be happy, but unfortunately some rioters choose to do all these sorts of criminal damages, arson, wounding, assaulting police officers and various behaviors, which are more or less equivalent to a riot offense,"" Stephen Lo, Hong Kong's police commissioner, said in a news conference late Tuesday. 
Yet, it was the gunshot wound, rather than the arson, gasoline bombs and vandalism, that has left many here stunned and deeply worried about the future of a city where police shootings are rare and the force for decades has been respected and honored. 
Francis Lee, director of the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said that despite ""heightened levels of violence,"" the public generally has remained sympathetic to the protesters because of perceptions of government inaction, unresponsiveness and ""repeated police misconduct."" 
""In this situation, many citizens find it hard to blame the protesters even if they might not feel entirely comfortable with some of the most violent tactics, such as the use of petrol bombs,"" Lee said. 
A public opinion survey from Lee's university shows the share of people who said they have no trust at all in the Hong Kong police has grown from 6.5 percent in early June - right before the protests started - to 48.3 percent in early September. 
 Even before Tuesday, anger between residents and the police had been building. On Sunday, residents and restaurant workers emerged from the Wan Chai district to heckle and jeer at police and throw bottles at their vans.
As riot officers marched down the street to clear protesters and make arrests, some residents followed, shouting vulgarities and mocking them by barking like dogs. 
Like Lau, the Hong Kong police sergeant, many police officers have turned to their admirers in mainland China for support. Lau began posting to the Chinese site Weibo in September and has since amassed a fan base of more than 600,000.

At least 10 other Hong Kong police officers have recently opened verified Weibo accounts and been flooded with mainland praise, including, in one case, a marriage proposal.

Huge strike shuts down Hong Kong,"HONG KONG - A general strike in Hong Kong on Monday paralyzed transportation networks at rush hour, forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights, and shut down scores of businesses and restaurants after another chaotic weekend of protests across several parts of the city.
The strike, along with demonstrators who are increasingly using tactics to outsmart police, is intensifying pressure on Hong Kong's government to acquiesce to the pro-autonomy movement's demands for a full withdrawal of an unpopular extradition bill, investigation of police use of force in recent weeks and greater democracy.
Protesters sent police on a chase through the city Sunday night, changing routes several times and briefly shutting down traffic in several neighborhoods. 
""A lot of radical and violent acts happened at multiple locations in the territory,"" police said in statement Monday morning, elaborating that protesters had committed arson and ""hurled bricks and hard objects"" at police stations. 
 Police had to respond to protests in at least eight neighborhoods, as protesters changed routes multiple times to stave off arrests. Police used tear gas in areas including Causeway Bay, a neon-lit shopping hub, a scene that is becoming commonplace even in residential and heavily touristed areas in the major financial center.
Police arrested 44 people for offenses including unlawful assembly and possession of offensive weapons, they said Monday morning.
Black-clad protesters chanted ""Monday! Strike!"" as they flooded into the busy shopping district to occupy the city's cross-harbor tunnel. 
Tens of thousands appeared to heed their call Monday, as airline pilots, crews, bus drivers, financial planners and others declined to show up to work. By 9 a.m., transportation networks in the normally efficient financial hub were suspended or delayed, including the airport express train linking the city center to the airport. Terminals were chaotic as more than 200 flights into or out of Hong Kong were delayed.
The mass protests, some drawing millions, began in early June over a now-shelved extradition bill that would have allowed fugitives in Hong Kong to be sent to mainland China for trial. The proposal is seen as a major threat to Hong Kong's independent judiciary system, which is supposed to be protected by the ""one country, two systems"" framework established after the colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
As the Beijing-backed government has refused to compromise on any of the protesters' demands, demonstrations have evolved into a broader movement against Chinese interference and the erosion of the territory's civil liberties. Protests have become a weekly, if not daily, occurrence, with demonstrations targeting the airport, shopping malls, transportation systems and government buildings.
Sunday saw two main rallies: the first in a residential area in eastern Kowloon called Tseung Kwan O, the second in central areas of Hong Kong island. By using a new guerrilla strategy, protesters who were part of the second rally sent police flying all over the city, quickly disrupting and departing busy areas to avoid confrontations.

Protesters on Hong Kong island diverted from the rally's starting point several miles west, where the Chinese government's liaison office and police building nearby were barricaded in anticipation of clashes. Two weekends ago, the liaison office was the focus of rage for protesters, who defaced the building and the Chinese emblem.

""We are very angry,"" said Kenji Chen, a 39-year-old English teacher at the park rally on Hong Kong island. ""Hong Kong people, we are so frustrated. The government should be of the people, for the people, by the people. But what the government is doing is to please the Chinese government. It's not listening to the people.""
This weekend was the ninth in a row of increasingly hectic and violent demonstrations. A police- approved march through major shopping district Tsim Sha Tsui on Saturday splintered into protests around Kowloon, a peninsula opposite the city's central business district.
At one point, protesters briefly occupied a cross-harbor tunnel and spray-painted it with ""revolution of our times"" and ""ideas are bulletproof."" Protesters also removed the Chinese flag from a pole and flung it into the harbor.
China's liaison office expressed its ""strong indignation,"" saying in a statement that the move ""flagrantly offended the dignity of the country and the nation and trampled on the bottom line of the 'one country, two systems.'""
Samuel Wong, a 23-year-old protester, said he fears authorities will ""treat Hong Kongers just like a normal Chinese city.""
""The biggest fear is, they cancel the system, one country, two systems,"" he said.
Calls have intensified for an independent investigation into the police, as protests regularly end in exchanges of projectiles, tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper spray. Police have come under fire since a mob attack last month left 45 people injured in a subway station. Police, who arrived 39 minutes later, are accused of condoning the violence and colluding with the attackers. Police deny the claim.
An independent investigation is one of the five main protest demands, alongside calling for the leader Carrie Lam to step down, the removal of the term ""rioters"" from the June 12 protest, amnesty for all those arrested and the direct election of officials.
Authorities show no sign of acquiescing to any demands. China's top military official in Hong Kong called the protests ""absolutely intolerable,"" and video was released of the People's Liberation Army conducting anti-riot drills in Hong Kong.
In a rare news conference, China's top office for Hong Kong affairs condemned protesters, reiterated its support for Lam and the police, and called the return of law and order its ""most pressing priority.""

Hong Kong protests expand in reach,"Demonstrators march in populous suburb, add demands for suffrage
HONG KONG - Protests in Hong Kong expanded in terms of geographical reach and demands Sunday as thousands of people marched in the streets of a populous suburb, calling not just for the complete withdrawal of a bill allowing extradition to China but also the right to vote for their leaders.
As the march wound down, violent clashes broke out between riot police and a small group of protesters. After using pepper spray and batons to push people back, officers forcibly cleared protesters from a suburban shopping mall in an escalation of chaotic scenes that have become commonplace here. Videos showed officers being attacked with metal sticks and other makeshift weapons by a small mob.

Pro-democracy groups reported that several of their members had been arrested, and live video feeds showed officers subduing protesters. Police did not immediately provide details on arrests.
Organizers rallied demonstrators around calls for universal suffrage for Hong Kong, the latest sign of how the movement has grown to include broader demands - all squarely pointed at Beijing's influence. 

""We want total democracy in Hong Kong,"" said Kelvin Wong, who declined to give his age. ""We need to be autonomous.""
Sunday's protest was held in Sha Tin, an area populated in the 1970s as the city expanded. Protesters have deliberately moved into neighborhoods beyond central Hong Kong in an effort to reach the wider population. Sha Tin is in the New Territories, a hilly region between Hong Kong's Victoria Harbor and mainland China, and is popular with mainland Chinese visitors.

""We used to not really protest in residential areas. Most of us think it's not good to disturb the neighborhood,"" said Jacky Chan, 26, who says he has been involved in most of the protests over the past five weeks. ""But it is significant that these residential neighborhoods will allow us to do these events here."" 
He added that the protests could help reach locals who might otherwise consume only pro-government news. 
Some residents unfurled banners of support from their homes Sunday and threw umbrellas and other supplies to the crowd. The protesters use umbrellas as shields against riot police.
The citizens of the semiautonomous territory of Hong Kong do not vote directly for their leaders, who are instead chosen by a 1,200-member committee out of a pool of candidates screened by Beijing. 
Protests in 2014 known as the Umbrella Movement represented a landmark moment in the city, shuttering parts of downtown over a demand for universal suffrage. Those protests were ultimately quashed and their leaders imprisoned.
""The extradition law has reminded us that what we really need above anything else is democracy,"" Chan said. He and others want a government that is more accountable to the people of the city than to authorities in Beijing and is able to address their concerns about soaring living costs.
A separate protest was held Saturday in Sheung Shui, close to Hong Kong's border with the mainland city of Shenzhen, against ""parallel traders"" from China who buy baby formula and other necessities tax-free and then sell them to day-trippers from the mainland at marked-up prices. 
Local residents say the traders have pushed out mom-and-pop shops and depleted supplies of groceries and other goods. 

During Saturday's demonstration, ambulances were seen taking a few injured protesters from the site. A number of police officers were also injured, according to videos and local reports.
""Some protesters deliberately blocked the roads after the procession, hurled iron poles, scattered an unknown powder, charged police cordon lines and assaulted police officers,"" the Hong Kong government said in a statement after the rally. ""The government strongly condemns the violent acts committed.""
The government statement also spelled out measures Hong Kong has taken to ""mitigate the nuisance"" caused by the parallel traders.
The traders typically take advantage of multiple-entry visas into Hong Kong and sometimes hire illegal workers.Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, last week described the extradition plan as ""dead"" and stressed that the Hong Kong legislature would be unable to advance it after the groundswell of dissent. But she has repeatedly declined to fully withdraw the bill, which in Hong Kong requires a specific legislative procedure rather than just a statement.
The weekend demonstrations were the latest indication of a sustained wave of dissent here that has grown to include demands unlikely to be met by Beijing authorities. Many in Hong Kong say that their leader is illegitimate. Half a dozen more protests are planned for the coming week, including a march led by the elderly.
All across Hong Kong, memorial walls - known as ""Lennon Walls"" for a memorial in Prague filled with messages supporting global causes - have cropped up. They were first used as a protest tool during the 2014 Umbrella Movement. Colorful sticky notes bearing inspirational messages now obscure walls at subway stations and overpasses. 
""We have come back even stronger"" since 2014, Wong said.

"China's warning to Hong Kong: Less tolerance, more patriotism","Communist Party hinted it will escalate response to pro-democracy protesters
BEIJING - China's ruling Communist Party signaled it is preparing to take a tougher approach toward pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, declaring Friday that it would strengthen ways to ""safeguard national security"" and step up efforts to make Hong Kongers more patriotic toward the mainland.
The warnings, coming at the end of a four-day party meeting in which the apparatchiks reiterated their loyalty to Chairman Xi Jinping and hailed his iron-fisted leadership, mark an escalation in Beijing's language about the protests.
""The [party's] Central Committee seems to have reached the conclusion that they need to do more about Hong Kong and in a much more active manner,"" said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University. ""China wants to exert much more control over Hong Kong and manage the situation with a firmer grip.""
The Communist Party organs that control China conduct their business behind closed doors, providing few details about the sausage-making process of Chinese politics. This week's meeting, officially called the Fourth Plenum of the 19th Party Congress, was no exception.
A communique released Thursday contained predictable statements about the party's wise leadership, with Xi at its core, and the virtues of China's socialist system. But in a news conference Friday, officials took a noticeably harder line when asked about the protests in Hong Kong, which began in June.
Beijing will act to ""firmly safeguard national sovereignty and security,"" said Shen Chunyao, director of the Hong Kong, Macao and Basic Law Commission. 
""We will absolutely not tolerate any behavior that challenges the bottom line of 'one country, two systems,' "" he told reporters, referring to the arrangement under which Hong Kong has enjoyed certain rights not available on the mainland. 
When Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, Beijing agreed that the territory would enjoy a high level of autonomy for 50 years. But under Xi, that autonomy, including freedom of speech and a distinct legal system have been steadily eroded.Unlike mainland China, Hong Kong has multiple political parties and a vibrant civil society. But its leader, or chief executive, must be chosen from candidates approved by Beijing and must adhere to the ""one country, two systems"" structure.

Residents of the Asian financial hub have been demonstrating against the party's increasing encroachment into their system and are calling for the right to elect their leader without restrictions.
Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, is widely seen as a puppet of Beijing, while its authorities this week acted to bar democracy activist Joshua Wong, who is reviled by Beijing, from running in local elections.
In the only nod to the protesters' concerns, Shen said that Beijing would try to ""improve"" the process through which Hong Kong's chief executive was selected. However, the statement was vague and gave no details.
At Friday's briefing, Shen also said that Beijing would not permit ""any behavior encouraging separatism or endangering national security"" and would keep a close watch for foreign actors ""carrying out acts of separatism, subversion, infiltration and sabotage.""
But that would further inflame tensions, said Suzanne Pepper, an American political analyst in Hong Kong. 
""There isn't a whole lot that Beijing can do in that respect except issue more decisions on the Basic Law, but that will only send more people onto the streets, more violence, and harsher police measures,"" she said. Still, she added, Beijing does not seem inclined to send the People's Liberation Army onto the streets of Hong Kong. Despite sending unsubtle messages to Hong Kong by deploying troops to its border with the mainland, analysts say, China cannot risk heavy-handed military action - like that which brought an end to pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989 - in a global financial capital that helps China do business with the wider world.
Instead, Beijing appears to want to expand its propaganda efforts, ubiquitous on the mainland, into Hong Kong. Shen said the party would ""strengthen the patriotic education of our Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, especially among civil servants and young people, teaching them about the [Chinese] constitution Chinese history and culture, in order to boost their national consciousness and patriotic spirit,"" he said.
Macao is a former Portuguese colony that was handed back to China in 1999, and it operates under the same ""one country, two systems"" formula. Beijing has held up Macao, a gambling hub that has not been riven by protests, as an exemplary region.
 Experts scoffed at the idea that young people in cosmopolitan Hong Kong would fall for such ploys.
""Unless they put people in concentration camps like in Xinjiang, it's not going to work,"" Cabestan said, referring to reeducation camps in western China where more than 1 million Muslims have been detained. ""Even if they put people in camps, it won't work.""

"China can silence me, not the protests in Hong Kong","Last week I was deprived of the right to participate in Hong Kong's political system.
On Tuesday, Hong Kong authorities barred me from running in local elections for district council. I was the only candidate barred. Laura Aron, the officer who made the decision, claimed that my nomination was invalid largely because of my affiliation with Demosisto, a pro-democracy party that I helped co-found. She said she did not believe I would uphold Hong Kong's Basic Law.
In reality, the decision to target me was clearly politically driven, based on my role championing democratic rights in Hong Kong and engaging with the issue at an international level. This is nothing short of political screening and censorship.
In mid-October, I received two letters from Dorothy Ma, an officer who was screening my candidacy, asking me to ""clarify"" my political views. Though I had no desire to play along with attempts at censorship, I responded explaining my position and noting that authorities should not screen candidates. I did not hear back from Ma for a week. Then, when I finally visited Ma's office, I was told she was on leave due to sickness and was being replaced by Aron. The replacement process lacked transparency and did not follow the normal practice of appointing an officer who worked under Ma or was from a neighboring district. Soon after, Aron announced the decision to bar me.
When I first decided to run for the district council position, I understood that Beijing might decide to thwart my candidacy. The decision, and the suspicious way it was made, exposes to the world just how much Hong Kong is already under Beijing's authoritarian grip.
This is not the first time Hong Kong authorities have infringed on my political rights and those of my fellow activists. I have been placed in jail three times for my activism. After spending several months in prison this year for my role in the Umbrella Movement, I was released in June, but was arrested again in August alongside my colleague Agnes Chow for participating in the protests. Previously, the Hong Kong government disqualified six elected, pro-democracy legislators between 2016 and 2017.
This most recent outrage shows that Chinese and Hong Kong authorities have not learned from the protests. The protesters are calling for Beijing to respect its own promise to allow Hong Kong a democratic system until 2047, under the ""one country, two systems"" policy. This was a chance for Hong Kong's government to show it had heard the cries of Hong Kong's young generation and to bring a youth voice into the district council.
But Beijing is not even willing to allow Hong Kong a short window of freedom. Along with recent crackdowns against demonstrators on the streets, this highlights once again the importance of the protesters' five demands for the Hong Kong government: to fully withdraw the controversial extradition bill that triggered the protests; establish a commission to look into police brutality; retract the description of protesters as ""rioters""; provide amnesty to those arrested in the protests; and commit to universal suffrage for electing the chief executive and entire Legislative Council until 2047.
This is a moment when the international community must speak up. In the United States, the House just passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. After learning of the news of my barring, several senators have called for its swift passage in the Senate, too. This is crucial. Three senators have also introduced the Hong Kong Be Water Act, which would sanction government officials responsible for cracking down on freedom of expression in Hong Kong. These actions would signal to Beijing that it should loosen its grip or face international pressure.
My candidacy may have been barred. But our movement continues - and this has catalyzed only more anger and frustration among young Hong Kongers hoping for change. My friend and colleague Kelvin Lam has bravely decided to run in my place. Angus Wong and Tiffany Yuen - who were staffers under Nathan Law, a lawmaker disqualified in 2017 at Beijing's behest - are also running for office. I will spend the next few weeks campaigning for them and will continue to push for human rights in Hong Kong going forward.
And on Nov. 24, Hong Kongers must vote to have their voices heard. The election is a referendum on Beijing's actions and an opportunity to show the strength of our will and stand up for our rights. Beijing can bar me from running, but I refuse to be silenced. Democracy begins on the ground - and China cannot silence us all.
The writer is secretary general and co-founder of Demosisto."
"After police violence, Hong Kong protests focus on airport","Demonstrators block access in 'stress test' as divide deepens
HONG KONG - Hong Kong protesters on Sunday shifted their focus back to the city's airport, hindering access to one of the world's busiest international transit hubs, prompting clashes with police, transportation snarls and confusion.
Their action, a ""stress test"" to force the government to respond to their demands after months of sustained demonstrations, caused airlines to delay and cancel flights and left passengers with few ways to get to the airport. Many got off at nearby bus terminals and just walked. 
Organizers said they hoped to hold similar actions every weekend if the government does not give in to their demands.
""The airport is vital to the economy of Hong Kong,"" one of the organizers of Sunday's action told reporters over the Telegram secure messaging app. ""The most impactful way to express our five demands is to go to the airport.""
By the afternoon, an express train connecting the city to Hong Kong International Airport was suspended - first because of a decision from authorities and later because demonstrators had flung objects on the track. Protesters began marching to a subway stop close to the airport, blocking a major access road.
Kiko Escuadro, a 27-year-old tourist heading back to Manila, said the closures forced him to walk an hour and a half from a train station to the airport.
He did not mind the inconvenience, however, and made his flight. 
""I understand what they are fighting for,"" Escuadro said. ""They are young people fighting for their future.""
The rallies followed intense clashes between protesters and police in Hong Kong on Saturday, a day that ended with fear and violence at subway stops when riot police stormed trains filled with commuters going about their evening, swinging batons and making arrests.
On Sunday, police were waiting at the piers for ferries from Lantau Island, where the airport is located. They stopped and searched those who got off the boats, collected bags of evidence and wrote down identification numbers.
With other public transportation largely shut down, hundreds walked along the highway for hours across Lantau Island back toward Hong Kong Island.
Eventually, they were met at a toll plaza by dozens of volunteer drivers who answered calls put out on Telegram using the hashtag #backhome to assist demonstrators. Drivers filled their cars to shuttle protesters away; other demonstrators boarded double-decker buses.After 13 straight weekends of protest, the rupture between Hong Kong police and civilians appears to be solidifying, with no end to the crisis in sight. The government refuses to make concessions, and protesters have been undeterred by mass arrests and police use of force.
Hong Kong International Airport, a major Asian hub ranked among the world's most efficient, has been the focus of previous demonstrations. Protests against a proposed law to allow extraditions to mainland China have attracted widespread support across the semiautonomous Chinese territory. Since returning to mainland control in 1997, Hong Kong has fought to protect its democratic freedoms and unique culture.
A demonstration at the airport last month turned ugly as protesters held two Chinese men - one a reporter for the Global Times, a Communist Party newspaper - and blocked passengers from boarding their flights. 
A court injunction has banned further gatherings at the airport, so protesters on Sunday focused their action on a bus stop outside the terminal and on roads around the airport. Terminals were heavily fortified by police, who were letting in only travelers with boarding passes. 
Hong Kong police marching through the airport Sunday afternoon were met with boos and jeers. Relations between the force and most city residents appear to be at an all-time low, as officers are perceived to be doing Beijing's bidding in suppressing the city's freedoms.
Later Sunday, protesters entered the Tung Chung metro station in the neighborhood next to Hong Kong's airport and defaced it. They smashed glass panes, flooded the station and sprayed graffiti reading ""communist rail trash"" and ""glory to Hong Kong"" on the walls. Protesters also lit barricades and roadblocks on fire.
The MTR Corporation, which runs the subway system, has come under protester fire over perceptions that it is not keeping demonstrators and commuters safe from police brutality. The transportation operator closed stations closest to planned protests after Chinese state media accused it of facilitating the unrest.

China has threatened military action and held less than subtle crowd-control and riot drills across the border. Beijing's threats have changed policies, forced resignations and created a climate of fear in one of Hong Kong's most recognizable brands, the Cathay Pacific airline. 
 Still, it is the Hong Kong police that has been the main tool for suppressing the protests. Saturday night's attacks on demonstrators, many of which were caught on video, alarmed residents, as the police have been dramatically increasing their use of force.
Videos shot by reporters and eyewitnesses showed masked officers charging into a stalled subway car, swinging wildly at people crumpled on the floor. The officers used pepper spray within the car, leaving commuters screaming in pain and crying. 
As protests were winding down in central Hong Kong, officers from an elite tactical unit stormed subway stations in Kowloon, across the harbor from Hong Kong Island, and arrested dozens.
A focal point of the violence was the Prince Edward subway station, which connects passengers to a dense residential neighborhood and tourist sites including a flower market. A 30-year-old woman who was returning home from her office through the station said trains were running slower than usual, so she called her father to pick her up from the station. When she began to leave, she saw police storm in, and she rushed to alert others that they should flee. 
""More and more police kept coming in,"" she said through tears. ""They rushed the protesters and started to beat them up.""
She and others spoke on the condition of anonymity in fear of reprisals.Another commuter angrily yelled at an officer, who turned to confront her. 
""I was worried that he was going to grab her,"" the woman said and started to cry. ""I just held the lady and patted her on the shoulder to show [the police] that she was not alone and they couldn't grab her.""
A 25-year-old woman who was waiting at Prince Edward station after seeing a movie said police swarmed in and began indiscriminately tackling people. The woman was shoved into a train car but quickly jumped out again.
""Once the police came, the whole thing became a mess,"" she said. ""The cops were beating citizens without differentiating them from protesters. If I didn't leave the train immediately, I would have been beaten by the police as well.""
Among those arrested in the subway was a 13-year-old boy attending his first protest, according to a 22-year-old who had been keeping an eye on him. Police confirmed the arrest.
""I started crying because all he wanted to do was to fight for Hong Kong and experience the protests himself, but I couldn't keep him safe,"" said the older protester.
A doctor returning from his shift at a public hospital left his subway car after an announcement from the MTR. As he took the escalator up from the platform, he said, police burst in and ""began dragging down anyone they could grab on to.""
His work had largely kept him away from the demonstrations, he said, and he hadn't fully believed the stories about the police use of force this past summer. Now he does. 
""The police are not the police that we used to know,"" he said. ""The Hong Kong police are all gangsters until proven otherwise. I don't feel safe talking to a single policeman now.""
Police officials said they were responding to protesters who were participating in an illegal assembly and destroying property in the subway stations. A police spokeswoman said officers used their ""professional experience"" to distinguish between protesters and ordinary commuters. She later acknowledged that it would have been difficult to tell them apart.

"In Hong Kong, the road darkens ahead","HONG KONG

As tens of thousands of protesters marched down Hennessy Road toward government headquarters Sunday afternoon, chanting pro-democracy slogans and waving American flags, it was an exuberant celebration of this territory's yearning for freedom.
The protesters seemed heedless of the danger: Men and women, young and old, ninja-clad teenagers and moms with their kids, all joined in the 15th straight weekend of protest. A doctor at a hospital, a 56-year-old schoolteacher and a 19-year-old girl studying German, English and philosophy stopped to explain to me their chant: ""Fight for freedom! Stand with Hong Kong!""
When the marchers passed a pro-Beijing newspaper office, they booed. Approaching the police headquarters, they raised their middle fingers and shouted insults, calling the cops gangsters and dogs. In the hot afternoon sun, they distributed blue fans imprinted with a cartoon of a frantic fish and the words: ""I thought water was a basic fish right . . . and I thought freedom was a basic human right.""
Watching the Hong Kong protests is exhilarating in a world where democracy often seems in retreat and autocrats are on the rise. But I had a nagging fear, too. This idealistic, largely leaderless protest reminds me of the early days of the Arab Spring. That worries me. Without strong leadership, this movement could have a similar unhappy ending.
Sunday afternoon ended with a spasm of violence that's a foreboding of trouble ahead. The hardcore protesters lingered outside the government offices on Harcourt Road while the other marchers moved on. Watching from an overpass 100 yards away, I could see the young would-be warriors crouching behind concrete barriers, cradling bricks and, it turned out, hidden petrol bombs - which they soon began hurling toward the riot police.
As the petrol bombs torched trees and grass inside the government compound, the protesters cheered. The young radicals wanted a confrontation, and they eventually got one. Canisters of tear gas were fired from nearby buildings, and a water cannon advanced, followed by baton-wielding riot police. (My thanks to Robert Godden and Jennifer Wang of Rights Exposure, a monitoring group, who provided me with protective gear so I could watch the drama unfold.)
It's now more than 100 days since the pro-democracy protests began in early June. The South China Morning Post tallied the numbers: So far, there have been 2,414 rounds of tear gas fired and 1,453 people arrested. The economic impact is growing, too. Cathay Pacific, a Hong Kong airline, reported a 38 percent slump in inbound traffic in August compared with a year earlier; some hotels reported their occupancy rates falling to nearly half. 
The democratic movement has deep roots here. At nearly every rapid-transit stop and public gathering place, there's what's known as a ""Lennon Wall,"" with graffiti, placards and personal protest notes. The authorities take down the messages, and by the next day, people have posted a new array. Last week, demonstrators gathered at shopping malls and other public places to sing their new anthem, ""Glory to Hong Kong,"" which proclaims: ""Freedom shall shine upon us.""

Martin Lee, a human rights activist who led democracy protests a generation ago and is now 81, tells me he sympathizes even with the militants who have used violent tactics. ""For 35 years, I used peaceful means, and they ignored me,"" he says.
Where is this lovable but ill-defined movement heading? During a week in Hong Kong, I put that question to militant protesters and pro-Beijing government officials, as well as to local business leaders and media pundits. In several dozen conversations, I heard the same basic answer that Lee gave: ""How will it end? I don't know."" 
It's now a precarious stalemate: The Hong Kong government is weak and waging what amounts to a weekly standoff; Beijing is frustrated but seemingly doesn't want to intervene militarily; the protesters have broad popular support but no leaders who could forge a pragmatic victory. A prominent former Hong Kong official told me he wants to negotiate with the young protesters, but in this amorphous, Internet-based movement, he can't find them.
What's profoundly moving is that the Hongkongers are openly defying mainland China, which in 1997 promised ""one country, two systems"" but is widely seen to have reneged. A former official explains why he became disenchanted: ""I thought we were on the same railway line. Hong Kong was ahead of the mainland, but we were headed to the same destination (of freedom). I don't believe that anymore.""
This is a brave, noble movement. It needs leaders who can decide what success looks like, and seize it now, while they're winning. The road darkens ahead.

Chaos engulfs Hong Kong campus,"Police storm university and threaten live rounds before flames force exit


HONG KONG "" Police briefly stormed a university campus held by anti-government protesters early Monday, making arrests and threatening to meet further resistance with live rounds before retreating in the face of a growing fire "" a stunning new escalation in the six-month-long struggle for democracy that has moved in recent days to this territory's campuses.
The demonstrators, who spent Sunday countering police water cannons of stinging blue dye with gasoline bombs, held their ground early Monday morning local time. Just before daybreak, officers from a special tactical unit entered the campus and made dozens of arrests, according to local news reporters at the site. Then a live feed showed a university entrance engulfed in flames. Demonstrators were feeding the fire to hold off police.
The confrontation showed how many young protesters have followed a steady path of radicalization as the movement presses forward with significant public support. Although police insist on ending the protests and neutralizing their core of front-line activists, it grows increasingly unclear where the unrest will lead, how it will end and whether the damage can be undone.

The protesters at Hong Kong Polytechnic University rained molotov cocktails down on riot police officers and their vehicles Sunday in one of the longest days of fighting since the demonstrations began in June. One police media liaison officer was struck in the calf with an arrow. Skirmishes raged into the night, leaving a police vehicle burning and the air thick with tear gas.
As police tried to move in on campus, they warned stronger measures could follow. They sealed the exits, leaving hundreds of students trapped inside the university.
'We will use the minimal force,' police said in a Facebook video. 'We are asking the rioters to stop assaulting the police using cars, gas bombs and bows and arrows. Otherwise we will use force, including live rounds.'
In a video widely shared on social media, a protester in a raincoat and a full-face respirator said he would stay at the university 'until the end.'
'What will happen to [the students] if we leave?' he asked. 'I am so afraid, but I have no choice.'

Police said early Monday that they were trying to disperse and arrest 'a large gang of rioters' who 'hurled petrol bombs at police' and 'set objects ablaze.' In a statement, police said they did not 'raid' the campus.
'Fires were observed in various locations in the PolyU premises. Explosives, flammable substances and dangerous goods also pose threats to anyone therein,' police said. 'Police appeal to everyone inside the campus to leave immediately.'
In a message released Monday morning, Polytechnic University President Teng Jin-Guang said he had negotiated with police through the night to reach an agreement: Officers would refrain from using force if protesters did not instigate clashes.
'We have now received the assurance of police of a temporary suspension of the use of force under the condition that if the protesters do not initiate the use of force, the police will not initiate the use of force,' Teng said. He added that he would personally accompany protesters who left the campus peacefully to the police station to ensure they were treated fairly.
An open letter by the students inside the campus, posted on messaging app Telegram, accused the university leadership of siding with police to facilitate the arrest of students. They vowed to fight to the end.
'No freedom, no life. We won't be afraid of arrest or death. Because history will find us innocent,' the letter said.
By early Monday, police had not used live ammunition at the university. Elsewhere, police fired several rounds at protesters who were pelting officers in an ambulance with bricks, but they hit no one, according to witnesses and a video of the incident.
A spokesman for the police force did not immediately confirm the use of live rounds. 
A front-line officer, speaking on condition of anonimity, said the police strategy was to surround the campus, block the exits, and wait for the demonstrators to leave. On Monday morning, police made dozens of arrests in the Tsim Sha Tsui neighborhood adjoining the campus, local media reported.
The current pro-democracy movement was sparked by a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam eventually scrapped that legislation, but not before the movement had grown to include the long-held demand that the people be allowed to vote for their own leaders and remain autonomous from Beijing. For many here, the events of the past months have eroded their trust in the territory's institutions "" and the police, in particular "" while giving rise to a new generation of young protesters who believe this to be the defining fight of their lives. 
The all-day standoff began early, with police pummeling front-line protesters with volleys of tear gas and water cannons that streamed irritating blue liquid. Protesters responded with gasoline bombs.
Much of the battle centered on the bridge leading to campus from the nearby metro station, which protesters had filled with barricades. As night fell, they repeatedly set it alight to prevent the police from advancing onto the university grounds.
Police announced at 9-p.m. that the 'next round of operation' was beginning, leading to speculation that they would storm the campus. They threatened to arrest those involved on charges of rioting, which can incur penalties of up to 10-years in prison.
University authorities had implored students not to engage in violence. In a statement, they said they were 'gravely concerned that the spiraling radical illicit activities will cause not only a tremendous safety threat on campus, but also class suspension over an indefinite period of time.'

The university in Kowloon is next to a key cross-harbor tunnel that protesters blocked in recent days by setting fire to toll booths. Universities have become the latest flash points in the protests that have rocked this semiautonomous territory to its core.
In the face of an increasingly harsh police crackdown, protesters have taken up an eclectic spectrum of weapons, including bows and arrows and javelins "" probably appropriated from campus athletic departments.
In Sunday's battles, though, protesters' key weapon appeared to be gas bombs. At one point, a police van speeding toward their barricades was set alight by a flurry of molotov cocktails and forced to retreat.
Polytechnic University was one of the last campus strongholds after an intense week of protests centered on the city's universities. The clashes over the past week, which unusually spilled into the workweek, were prompted by the death of a young protester following a police operation earlier this month.
After police laid siege to the Chinese University of Hong Kong last week, protesters barricaded other campuses and major roads, bringing the city and schools to a halt.

On Saturday, members of the People's Liberation Army, China's military, left their barracks to help clear the roadblocks that protesters had erected around universities. It was the PLA's first appearance on the streets of Hong Kong since the pro-democracy protests erupted in June.
As a semiautonomous territory, Hong Kong is legally distinct from mainland China. Although the army's presence here was not unprecedented "" it also appeared in September 2018 to assist with disaster relief after a severe hit from Typhoon Mangkhut "" the move was a subtle but significant development. Under Hong Kong law, the PLA may not interfere in local affairs unless invited by the Hong Kong government.

On Saturday, the Hong Kong government denied that it had invited the PLA to clear the roadblocks, saying the work was a 'voluntary community activity,' according to Chinese state-owned CGTN. The development drew sharp criticism from pro-democracy lawmakers, who said it was illegal and a public relations stunt by Beijing to normalize the army's presence in the territory.
Lawmaker Cheng Chung-Tai, a graduate of Polytechnic University, called the standoff there a 'humanitarian crisis.' 
'Carrie Lam's murderous regime has resorted to brutality, which makes Hong Kong become a state of savage existence and astonishes the international communities,' he said in a statement early Monday.
At a peaceful rally Sunday in Hong Kong's central business district, Alex said the involvement of the PLA was unacceptable.
'They cannot be volunteers because they are soldiers,' said the 35-year-old clerk, who gave only his first name for fear of retribution. 'They're conveying a message that they will be going out. They will take action if the situation is not getting better.'
The Education Bureau announced that all classes would be canceled on Monday. Classes were suspended for most of last week as protests and a strike paralyzed the city. Two university campuses have called off classes for the rest of the semester.

Hong Kong's protests don't need a leader,"HONG KONG


Lee Cheuk-yan
, unlike most Americans, remembers and reveres Lane Kirkland, a hero of the first Cold War. During 16 years as leader of the AFL-CIO (1979-1995), Kirkland gave crucial support, both material and moral, to Lech Walesa
and the Solidarity movement in Poland, where it was an early tremor in the political earthquake that ended European communism. Here, in this island city at the other end of the Eurasian landmass, a city that has become a flash point in Cold War 2.0, Lee is lending support to a fluid, shape-shifting protest movement that has no Walesa.
This lack is a strength and a weakness. The movement has no leader with whom the local government, which is an appendage of Beijing - and, hence, of the Chinese Communist Party - might negotiate. Fortunately, however, a movement without a head cannot be easily decapitated, which otherwise probably would be Beijing's default position. 
This thought experiment became the premise of a 2018 novel (Chloe Benjamin's ""The Immortalists
""): If you knew when you were going to die, how would this change how you choose to live? Hong Kong's young people, from whom come most of the demonstrations' participants and energy, know that the clock is ticking for their city. It is 22 years into what was supposed to be a 50-year grace period. In 1997, Britain ended 156 years of responsibility for Hong Kong, transferring it to China. 
So, just eight years after the Tiananmen massacre, there began what was supposed to be half a century of Hong Kong's exceptionalism preserved, after which the city might be gracefully melded with a mellowed mainland. Just 22 years later, this hope has been as refuted as the 1989 hope that the massacre would be followed by a less authoritarian, because more secure, Beijing regime. 
Lee was in a hotel overlooking Tiananmen Square when the tanks rolled in. He later organized Hong Kong's memorial museum, which is overseen by the same organization that facilitates commemorations every June 4. As a human bridge between the first Cold War and the next one, he knows that this city today is not like East Berlin in 1953, or Budapest in 1956, or Prague in 1968. In those places, people who were in despotism's firm grip rebelled and quickly learned how firm the grip was. Hong Kong is spectacularly vibrant
and prosperous because it perennially - since 1970 - holds the top position
in the Economic Freedom of the World Index rankings. 
When demonstrators here have waved colonial-era flags and shouted, ""Reclaim Hong Kong,"" they were not nostalgic for colonial restoration. Rather, this was largely a cry for the status quo. 
Largely, until now. Now, however, less and less. As a young woman from Hong Kong studying in Boston recently wrote in her college newspaper, ""I am from a city owned by a country that I don't belong to."" Residents of this city, especially young residents, are decreasingly likely to think of themselves as Chinese rather than as Hong Kongers. In 1997, 47 percent
of residents were ""proud to be a citizen of China."" Now only 38 percent
are. Among those ages 18 to 29, 55 percent
have a negative opinion of the Beijing regime, which has sown discord and is reaping disaffection.
The U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 commits the United States, as the State Department notes, to ""promote Hong Kong's prosperity, autonomy, and way of life."" Its ""way of life"" is a multifaceted condition that rests on freedom and universal suffrage. A recent Hong Kong demonstration called for passage by the U.S. Congress of legislation that would impose sanctions on mainland Chinese or Hong Kong officials who abridge the city's freedoms, and it would require annual review of the special economic privileges Hong Kong gets from the United States. This would make U.S. relations with Hong Kong more like those with Taiwan, which receives substantial U.S. military and other assistance to buttress its independence, even as U.S. policy adheres to the prudential fiction that Taiwan is something it currently is not and probably won't ever be (part of ""one China
"").
But Hong Kong could become yet another casualty of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, which made many Americans comprehensively skeptical of U.S. attempts, in the words of President John F. Kennedy's inaugural address, ""to assure the survival and the success of liberty"" around the world. Hong Kong, however, unlike Iraq, has a vibrant democratic culture and civil society. What is required of U.S. policy is not ""nation building"" but sustaining the reality of a polity that, without claiming or seeking nationhood, simply refuses to be absorbed into the domain of an increasingly nasty regime.

Hong Kong leader invokes colonial-era emergency powers to ban masks,"Lam's action to quash protests prompts more anger in the streets

HONG KONG - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam invoked rarely used and sweeping emergency powers Friday to ban face masks at demonstrations, a move that sought to quell pro-democracy protests - but that quickly had the opposite effect, intensifying anger on the streets. 
Lam's decision to use colonial-era security powers further inflamed tensions roiling since June and heightened fears that Hong Kong's basic freedoms were being eroded. The order effectively expands police powers of arrest, even as many in Hong Kong fear that police are operating with impunity in their growing use of force.
It could also risk tainting Hong Kong's hard-won reputation as an open financial hub, already under strain because of the upheaval of recent months. 
""Protesters' violence has been escalating and has reached a very alarming level in the past few days, causing numerous injuries and leading Hong Kong to a chaotic and panicked situation,"" Lam said in a news conference. Behind her, a banner read: ""Treasure Hong Kong, End Violence.""
""As a responsible government, we have the duty to use all available means to stop the escalating violence and restore calm in society,"" she said.
Lam added that while the emergency ordinance is being enacted to ban the masks, Hong Kong itself was not in a state of emergency but instead an in ""occasion of serious danger"" that required such laws. 
Critics were quick to reject the measure and the use of emergency laws, citing a variety of reasons, the most fundamental being predictions that it won't work.
 On Friday night, a crowd of thousands peacefully marched more than three miles through the city in opposition to the announcement and to the government. The demonstration later turned violent in several districts, with protesters throwing gasoline bombs and setting fire to symbolic targets such Chinese banks and subway stations.
 The Hong Kong Hospital Authority said a 14-year-old boy had been shot in the thigh.
Police said a plainclothes officer had fired one shot in self-defense against a ""large group of rioters"" who threw a gasoline bomb at the officer, lighting his body on fire.
""We should be prepared for the worst,"" said Michael Tien, a pro-Beijing lawmaker. Tien said he urged Lam and authorities in Beijing to offer a concession to the protest movement along with the ban, which he characterized as pushed by the police. 
""While giving the police the anti-mask law they wanted, secure from them the acceptance of an [independent investigation] into the force,"" he said. ""Now, it's all stick and no carrot."" 
The ban was put in place at midnight local time. It applies to rallies that have been given a go-ahead by police, as well as those that are unauthorized. The law authorizes a police officer to order the removal of facial coverings and take them off forcefully if the person does not comply. Noncompliance would be punishable by a fine or a jail term of up to a year. 
Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing lawmaker and a member of Hong Kong's executive council, said in an interview that such a ban should have come earlier in response to violence that has become ""totally unjustifiable."" 
""Freedom to express their views is not absolute,"" she said of the protesters. ""These people are interfering with our freedoms."" 
The mask ban was also pushed by a more hardcore group of Beijing loyalists within Lam's government who have accused her of being too soft on the unrest roiling the city.

In central Hong Kong, thousands of protesters filled the streets at lunchtime in a demonstration that continued into the evening after work hours. The protesters - some in heels or suits - left high-rise offices to join the march. Almost all of them wore masks. 
""This is adding fuel to the fire,"" Fernando Cheung, a pro-democracy lawmaker, said of the mask ban. ""The result is clear. This will mark the beginning of riots in Hong Kong.""
Lam's announcement came three days after widespread demonstrations across Hong Kong on Tuesday, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China - rallies that degenerated into street battles between protesters and police. Officers fired at protesters multiple times, using live ammunition for the first time since the demonstrations erupted in June. 
One protester was shot in the chest by an officer at close range after a group of protesters attacked police. The incident sparked even more demonstrations this week. The 18-year-old student, who remains hospitalized, was charged Thursday with rioting and assaulting a police officer. Police have said the shooting was justified. 
Beijing appeared to support the mask ban. Yang Guang, spokesman for China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said the chaotic situation there ""cannot continue endlessly.""

Protests began over a bill to allow extraditions to mainland China that many feared would erode the city's freedoms and the independence of its reputable legal system. They have since swelled into an all-out rebuke of Hong Kong's political system, in which leaders are handpicked by and answerable to Beijing. 
Demonstrators are pushing five demands, including an independent investigation of the police, but the government has responded only to one, the full withdrawal of the extradition bill.
On one major thoroughfare Friday, protesters marched down a four-lane road chanting ""Fight back, Hong Kong!"" and ""Fight for freedom!"" The march brought traffic to a halt, but some drivers stuck in the jam held up five fingers - a symbol of the five demands of protesters - outside the windows of their luxury sedans, beeping their horns in a show of support.

Penny, 35, who said he had worked in finance for 10 years, challenged police to use force against workers like him marching in the city center. 
""If the police dare to shoot us in Central during midday, come on and do it. Don't be a coward,"" he said, like others using only his first name, for fear of retribution. ""If Carrie Lam wants a police state, that is fine. We are not afraid.""
Others expressed fears that Lam's move was only the beginning of what would be an increasingly repressive crackdown on dissent. Lam has said repeatedly that a solution to the political crisis can be reached through dialogue. She held a community listening session last month, but the move failed to win her any support. 
""This is only the first step. In the coming weeks and months, [the government] will continue to use more force to push protesters not to voice any opposition,"" said Justin, 27, a corporate finance worker wearing a respirator, yellow construction helmet and goggles with tailored dress pants and a fitted shirt. 
Separately on Friday, the Education Bureau sent a letter to schools telling them to warn students not to wear masks inside or outside school, other than for religious or health purposes. ""Schools are not a place to express your political views,"" the letter said. 
Students have been a major force in the recent protests and make up a large share of the more than 2,000 people arrested in street demonstrations. They have also organized class boycotts and other shows of solidarity inside the classroom. 
The emergency powers, which date to 1922 when Hong Kong was under British colonial rule, allow authorities to censor the media; seize property; take control of all transportation, manufacturing and trade in the city; and detain people for lengthy periods.
Some legal experts say the emergency powers are not in line with Hong Kong's Basic Law, which grants the city its cherished freedoms, including the right to assembly. 
Eric Cheung, a principal lecturer at the University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law, said the use of the emergency ordinance to enact the law was alarming. 
""It sets a very bad and dangerous precedent in bypassing all of the normal legislative processes,"" he said. ""It means you can now pass a law without any consultation, without any debate, without any public participation or voting by the Legislative Council."" 
He added that the move is ""very, very damaging to Hong Kong"" and ""changes the whole legal landscape.""
Lam did not rule out enacting other regulations to curb protests, including a curfew. 
Ronny Tong, a member of Hong Kong's executive council and a legal adviser to Lam, said the decision was made because ""something had to be done"" after the Tuesday shooting.
""There's lots of limitations all around, in terms of the kinds of decisions that the Hong Kong government can make. We just have to cross our fingers and hope that this decision can work,"" he said. ""This is not being done with ill will. It is being done with the best interests of Hong Kong at heart.""

Shaken up at Hong Kong's top airline,"HONG KONG - Seats upright, belts on and tray tables up. As the pilot announced ""30 minutes to landing,"" the cabin crew on the Cathay Dragon flight to Chengdu, China, ran through their usual checklist. Then they rushed to the rear of the jet for a new precaution: They locked their smartphones in sales carts, hiding the devices between bottles of perfume and whiskey.

As the Chinese state zeroes in on individuals suspected of supporting ongoing protests against Beijing's influence in Hong Kong, it has singled out Cathay Pacific, the flagship Hong Kong airline that is among the city's biggest employers and most globally recognized brands, subjecting its staff to unprecedented scrutiny.
""We are panicked,"" said one flight attendant who has worked for the airline for seven years.
Airline staff describe a climate of fear and mistrust in their ranks, as Chinese officials target flight crews with thorough searches of their luggage and personal devices - including deleted files and secure messaging apps - for any signs of protest sympathies. Some have had their phones' content downloaded by Chinese authorities. Others have seen their private information published in public messaging groups, their anti-government inclinations laid bare.
The Washington Post interviewed almost a dozen current Cathay Pacific employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, and reviewed several internal staff memos, social media groups and messaging channels to compose a portrait of this time of turmoil at the flag carrier.
Pressure from Beijing forced out Cathay's chief executive, Rupert Hogg, along with one of his deputies on Friday. Two pilots have been fired, along with two ground workers. This week a third pilot, who made an in-flight announcement of support for Hong Kong, left the company under unclear circumstances, according to several employees.
""I feel so scared, like we have lost our ability to voice our opinions, our concerns and our hopes without feeling the authority of China,"" said another flight attendant, age 26.
The ongoing tumult at Cathay has implications that stretch beyond this current wave of protest, analysts say. It has sent the clearest signal yet that even global conglomerates based in the territory can be compelled to bow to Beijing's will - leading to doubts about whether the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement that allows Hong Kong a degree of autonomy within China can continue to hold. 
Cathay's predicament ""shows that when China wants to put the pressure on, it doesn't really matter whether you are based in Hong Kong or whether you are based in Shanghai. This is all still China,"" said Duncan Innes-Ker, the regional director for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit.
Cathay Pacific did not respond to detailed emailed questions. The Chinese aviation authority did not respond to multiple phone calls and faxed questions.
In the early days of Hong Kong's leaderless summer of protest, aviation workers, including Cathay staff, were among those at the forefront, understanding that they had a disproportionate ability to get the attention of their government.
They participated in a general strike that forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights, angled for a three-day airport sit-in that would further embarrass Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and her backers in Beijing, wrote open letters and set up secure messaging groups to organize further action.
Beijing's impatience with their involvement became clear on Aug. 9 when China's aviation regulator issued a warning directed at Cathay of a ""major aviation safety risk."" The airline had failed to bar staff who took part in ""violent protests"" from flying to the mainland or through Chinese airspace, the regulator said, adding that it wanted the airline to make swift changes.
Not complying wasn't something Cathay could afford. Cathay Pacific passenger and cargo routes, and those flown by sister brand Cathay Dragon and low-cost arm Hong Kong Express, include more than two dozen mainland cities. Passengers from the mainland account for a significant chunk of revenue. State-owned Air China is Cathay's second-biggest shareholder, after the Hong Kong- and London-based Swire group.
The regulator's warning also extended to any Cathay aircraft flying through the portion of Chinese airspace that surrounds Hong Kong, complicating travel to other parts of the world. 
Cathay staff interviewed by The Post said the aviation authority's warning changed their environment significantly. Before it was issued, they had not been chided by management for protest participation, even after the strike in early August forced the grounding of flights.
But at least six emails from Cathay management warning against illegal protest participation and urging compliance with Chinese authorities have come since Aug. 9, all of which were obtained by The Post. The latest was an internal memo sent by new chief executive Augustus Tang on Monday, stating that the company would comply ""100%"" with all directives issued by Chinese aviation regulators.
""The way every single one of us acts, not only at work serving our customers but also outside of work - on social media and in everyday life - impacts how we are perceived as a company,"" he wrote.
The past two weeks have also brought scrutiny - and what some believe to be harassment - of Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon crews flying to mainland cities. Phones and bags are being searched upon landing at cities from Hangzhou to Xi'an. When Cathay employees pushed back, their company sent a note on Aug. 17 saying authorities ""have the right to inspect personal electronic devices.""
Many are now trying to swap routes to avoid flying to the mainland altogether. 
""We don't think what the company is doing is supporting or protecting us,"" said the flight attendant who has worked at Cathay for seven years. ""We think our personal safety is in danger.""
What has scared employees most is a Telegram channel with almost 13,000 members that claims it is collecting information on protesters to pass along to China's Ministry of State Security, according to the group's description. Set up in July, the group has since changed its focus from protesters in general to specifically tracking airline and aviation staff, posting photos of them in their uniforms alongside social media posts in which they express support for the movement.
One post reads, ""Stupid flight attendant of Cathay,"" followed by her full name, which The Post has withheld for her privacy, and pictures of her with her young child. ""She has even sent her little kid to the protest!""
Staff members are ""very, very panicked because of this"" Telegram channel, said one Cathay ground worker. ""I'm 42 years old and I'm just panicked like a teenager.""
Others believe their colleagues who support the Hong Kong government and the police are monitoring them and reporting them to company officials. It has made for tense conversations in the galley and before flights, when jovial flight attendants usually chat with each other to pass time.
""Even today on my flight, a very long flight of 12 to 13 hours, no one in-flight is talking about politics,"" said one flight attendant. If they dare broach the subject, he added, ""we will ask beforehand, 'Are you supporting the protests?"" just very softly.""
Jeremy Tam, a pro-democracy lawmaker, resigned from his position at Cathay on Monday, a difficult decision he said he made to shield the company from further political attacks. Tam was a pilot at the airline until 2016, when he switched over to a consultancy role.
""This is a company I love,"" he said in an interview. ""And now [authorities] are destroying the company just like that, over freedom of speech and political views?""
One 24-year-old flight attendant pushed back on the notion that as a Cathay employee he should be barred from political protest.
""When we are on the flight, we won't say, 'Do you like chicken or beef? And by the way, please support Hong Kong.' We are professionals,"" he said. ""But we should have the freedom to join any protest, we should have our freedom of speech when we land.""

Thousands link hands at vigil in Hong Kong,"Protest turns more peaceful as Beijing becomes more aggressive
HONG KONG - Inspired by an effort 30 years ago in the Baltic states that called for the end of Soviet rule, tens of thousands in Hong Kong on Friday held hands under the night sky to form a human chain snaking 27 miles across the territory, in a vigil against an increasingly authoritarian China intent on clamping down against their protest movement.

""Hong Kongers, Add Oil!"" they chanted, a phrase that loosely translates to keep going. ""Democracy now!""
Parts of the human chain passed hand sanitizer down the line before holding their hands up in the air, linking themselves with friends, family and strangers. Participants turned on their cellphone lights and waved them toward the sky, illuminating the city's most iconic neighborhoods, including along Victoria Harbor, as passing cars honked in deafening support.
""I was a bit embarrassed holding strangers' hands at first,"" said one 29-year-old participant who wanted to be identified just by his last name, Lam. ""But later, I thought, we are family. Why not?""
As they held their peaceful demonstration - its imagery harking back to the similarly implausible fight against the Soviet Union's power in 1989 - there were more signs that Beijing is becoming increasingly aggressive in its efforts to stamp out the protests and squeeze entities seen as supportive of them.
Rebecca Sy, who heads a union representing flight attendants from Cathay Pacific's regional airline, held a news conference Friday announcing her termination, among the more than a dozen aviation industry workers forced out in connection to the political demonstrations. Diplomats, too, have come under pressure: A Hong Kong passport holder working for the British Consulate was detained while trying to return to the semiautonomous territory from Shenzhen, prompting the Canadian Consulate to halt mainland visits for its staff.
""All of these events, they are all related to the same thing, which is China taking away our freedoms,"" said Noelle, a 53-year old wedged in the line, who wanted to be identified by only her first name for fear of repercussions over her participation. ""This is exactly what we don't want in Hong Kong, and that is why we are here today.""
Noelle, along with a majority of participants, had their faces obscured with masks - an indication of the fear that has gripped this city. Protesters interviewed believe that even participating in peaceful protests can get one fired from their jobs or otherwise put them at risk.Friday's human chain, dubbed the ""Hong Kong Way,"" was an idea borrowed from an almost 400-mile long gathering of 2 million people in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Their demonstration was a bid for independence from the Soviet Union, and the show of unity discredited the Russian narrative at a time when Baltic independence was a fringe idea promoted by a group of radicals. 
The months that followed saw the decline and eventual collapse of the Soviet Union and independence for the Baltic states.
Hong Kong protesters participating in the vigil are fighting for their government to recognize demands that have hardened over their months-long protest movement. Triggered by a now-shelved extradition bill that would have allowed fugitives to be transferred to the mainland, demonstrators have been angling for an independent investigation into police use of force; they also want their government to be directly elected, believing their leaders serve Beijing rather than Hong Kong.
The idea for Friday's protest was first floated on the online messaging board LIHKG.com, which has served as a nucleus for strategies and mobilization over the past weeks. When thousands responded positively to the idea, seeing parallels between their fight against Beijing and that of the Baltic states against Russia, a loose group of organizers came together to discuss logistics and feasibility on the secure messaging app Telegram.
Preparations for the human chain were
complex logistically, said a 24-year old organizer who wanted to be known by the initials J.C. for fear of reprisal. In recent days, groups of volunteers have gone out to test the routes by making a short chain of people, testing out safety issues such as the presence of pedestrian crossings and roads. Organizers created a Google form to poll thousands of people on where they would like to gather and at what time they were planning to show up, and used live metrics on Friday night to assign people to less crowded areas of the city.
The route, which stretched across Hong Kong island, the Kowloon area across Victoria Harbor and the New Territories area which borders mainland China, was deliberately planned near subway stops to make participation convenient. More than 40 ""team leaders"" were on site on Friday, J.C. said, to direct the crowd and observe any safety considerations.
""We are very excited about it. It is a new form of protest happening in Hong Kong,"" he said. ""We've never done anything like this before.""
Protesters in recent weeks have urged nonviolent ways of getting their government's attention, after escalating violence between police, those perceived to sympathize with them and protesters. On a pages-long thread on LIHKG.com, some front-line protesters - more accustomed to ripping bricks off sidewalks and preparing for drawn-out confrontations with riot police - admitted that holding hands seemed ""lame"" but was an important show of unity at a pivotal time for Hong Kong.The action on Friday came amid indications of an increasingly multifaceted crackdown on those who support the protests, which has targeted diplomats and multinational corporations in the city, particularly Cathay Pacific Airways. The detention of the British Consulate employee, Simon Cheng, was a ""lesson of what will happen to us if the extradition bill passed,"" added Lam, one of the participants of Friday's protest.
On Friday, Sy, the head of the flight attendant union, said she was sacked Tuesday after confirming to management that she had posted several messages on her Facebook account that could be viewed only by her friends. She has worked for the airline for 17 years. China's aviation authority has been exerting unprecedented pressure on Hong Kong's flagship airline, banning any crew who have expressed support for recent protests from flights through mainland airspace.
In a statement posted on the company website, Cathay Pacific's director for corporate affairs James Tong said his company ""fully supports the upholding of the Basic Law and all the rights and freedoms afforded by it,"" referencing the framework that gives Hong Kong significant autonomy from mainland China.
""We are a leading international airline with global operations and therefore we are required to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate,"" he added.

Hong Kong officials arrest prominent movement leaders,"HONG KONG - Authorities widened crackdowns against Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement Friday, arresting prominent activists and lawmakers while warning that riot police would use force against protesters defying orders to stay off the streets.

The detentions attempted to strike at the heart of the demonstrations and underscored the increasing frustration among officials over the resilience of Hong Kong's marches and rallies that began this past spring.
But protesters did not appear shaken.
Authorities banned a march planned for Saturday and warned they would use force and possibly arrest those who ignore the order. Still, demonstrators are expected to return to the streets in a direct challenge to authorities.
The arrests Friday included Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow, who rose to eminence as the student leaders of pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014.
More than a dozen people have been arrested since Thursday. Among them were Andy Chan, the leader of a banned pro-independence party, and pro-democracy lawmakers and local representatives.
Police said Wong and Chow face charges of participating in an unauthorized assembly and inciting others to participate in an unapproved assembly, while Wong faces an additional charge of organizing an unapproved assembly, in relation to a June 21 protest at police headquarters. Both were released on bail Friday.
The sweep came ahead of a sensitive political anniversary in the semiautonomous Chinese territory. This Saturday marks five years since Beijing announced an electoral-reform plan that denied Hong Kong free elections - a decision that triggered 79 days of pro-democracy protests.
The latest protests were sparked by a now-shelved government proposal to allow extraditions to the mainland. But the demonstrations have broadened into a battle over the extent of Beijing's control over the former British colony.
Protesters fear Beijing's leaders could increasingly undercut the special freedoms and status granted to Hong Kong under the deal that returned the territory in 1997.
Patrick Kwok, chief superintendent of the police's public relations branch, told a news conference Friday that the timing of the arrests and the anniversary of the 2014 demonstrations were ""not correlated.""The dissent coincides with a delicate period for the ruling Communist Party, as the clock ticks down to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in October. China's government has issued increasingly strident threats in an effort to quell the unrest. A day earlier, China sent a new batch of troops to Hong Kong to reinforce the People's Liberation Army garrison in the city.
Friday's arrests, combined with the garrison rotation and rumors that Hong Kong may invoke emergency laws, were ""extremely alarming,"" said Samantha Hoffman, a fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute who studies Chinese politics.
""At the very least, it is clear that Beijing is attempting to intimidate the people of Hong Kong. The Chinese Communist Party places political protests very high on its list of threat perceptions,"" she said.
In a report after the roundup of the Hong Kong activists, China's official Xinhua news agency said more arrests were expected. Hours later, Xinhua posted a picture on its social media account with a pair of handcuffs and images of Wong, Chow and Chan with the caption, ""What goes around comes around.""
Police have arrested more than 800 people in connection with protests that have rocked the city since June, some of them on riot charges that can attract a prison sentence of up to 10 years.
After his release on bail, Wong was defiant. ""We will continue our fight no matter how they arrest and prosecute us,"" he told reporters. 
Man-Kei Tam, director of Amnesty International in Hong Kong, said the wave of arrests and the banning of the march appeared to be ""straight out of Beijing's playbook.""
Wong, 22, became known as the face of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, a street occupation aimed at securing universal suffrage for Hong Kong. He was charged and sentenced several times in connection with those protests, and he served three stints in jail. Most recently, on May 16, Wong was sentenced to two months in prison after losing an appeal against a prison term for contempt of court. He was released in June.
Along with Chow and another activist, Nathan Law, Wong went on to found the political group Demosisto, which advocates self-determination for Hong Kong. The three were arrested in 2017 ahead of Chinese leader Xi Jinping's visit to the city. 
Wong and Chow were due to travel to Washington next month, where they were to meet with lawmakers and participate in a congressional Executive Committee on China hearing on the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The bill, which has bipartisan support, including from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), seeks to punish those who suppress freedoms in Hong Kong, including through the use of sanctions and visa bans to the United States.

Five lives in Hong Kong transformed by a wave of dissent,"Protests' roots are multigenerational and go in many directions
HONG KONG - They traded school uniforms for black T-shirts and face masks. They lied to their employers for a day off. Babysitters watched young children while the parents were away at protests.

Across Hong Kong, otherwise average lives have been transformed by a wave of dissent against Beijing's increasing influence over the former British colony.
The spark for the demonstrations was a proposal to allow extraditions to China. But they reignited fears that Hong Kong will lose its relative autonomy - a promise under the ""one country, two systems"" framework - if they do not take a stand.
Their movement has been deliberately leaderless. That is partly to avoid prosecution, but also to empower all. Strategies are debated on messaging boards; protest routes are planned on secure apps.
The demonstrators draw on the echoes of their generation: Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989 for the older ones, the Umbrella Movement protests in Hong Kong in 2014 for those who are younger.
They all, however, see this fight as one that will define Hong Kong for years to come. 
The mother, 44
Gloria Kwong's political awakening came when she watched television broadcasts of tanks rolling down the streets of Beijing, crushing the student uprising in Tiananmen Square. 
""I was only in secondary school, like the age of the young people on the streets today,"" Kwong, 44, said. ""My eyes were opened."" 
After the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China, she watched with fear as Chinese influence crept into her city. In 2012, Kwong was among a group of parents opposing a ""national education"" proposal to promote Chinese Communism and denounce Western democracy. Protests forced authorities to back down. 
She found herself rushing to the protests and campaign meetings while still breast-feeding her second child. 
""There are so many examples telling me that, as a mother, I need to stand up for my children, especially when they are so young and don't have a voice,"" she said. 
Last month, after police tear-gassed and shot projectiles at protesters surrounding the legislative building, Kwong and her friends discussed what they could do. 
""We thought: If there was a more mature adult, standing among them, will the police still dare to do this?"" she said. 
Then came Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam's comments that same night, when she compared protesters to her own sons and said she could not indulge ""wayward behavior.""
Kwong and others had enough. They organized the first of two mothers rallies. The second had around 8,000 people.
Their efforts have been likened to the Tiananmen Mothers, a group of Chinese activists who lost children in the 1989 protests and have dedicated their lives to pushing for democracy.
Kwong feels uncomfortable about the comparison. 
""I want to do what I can do now, so we don't become Tiananmen mothers later,"" she said.
The family, 28 and 61
Jenny Chan and her 28-year-old son, King, share a small two-bedroom apartment in Tuen Mun, a suburb of Hong Kong far from the city's iconic harbor-front skyline. 
They also share political views, a rarity as generations often find themselves bitterly divided in their responses to upheavals. 
The young have been mostly on the forefront of some of the most radical moves - particularly the storming of Hong Kong's legislature July 2. Some protesters have returned home to parents who have tried to punish them, ground them or kick them out of their homes. 
Jenny - acknowledging that, at 61, she is past her prime to be on the front lines - is still there in spirit. 
""I am not brave enough to be breaking into buildings,"" she said. ""But we all have our own way to speak up."" She watched her son don his helmet and mask before he rushed out on the night the legislative building was occupied.
""Some people here only want to protect their money or power,"" she said fiercely. ""I have always taught my son what my mother taught me: that we must raise our voice if we see any injustice and speak out for what is fair."" 
The unforgiving economics of Hong Kong life are never far from politics.
Their family once lived in a large village home, its 2,000 square feet offering King and his brother ample space to grow up. Then rents were raised until it was no longer affordable. 
Jenny and her son are still renting, but this time just 400 square feet. 
""If we look around, we see this huge gap in wealth, and there are no longer opportunities to work hard and be successful,"" she said.
King is more stark.
""If I try to think of my future, all I see is none, no future at all,"" he said. ""I cannot imagine moving out. I cannot imagine owning a home. I cannot imagine building a life. All I can think is, in 30 or 40 years, it will be even worse because we won't even have our freedoms."" 
The student, 16
With a box of chocolate biscuit sticks in her hands and a checkered school dress, it is hard to imagine Gigi battling riot police in the street. 
Yet there she was: wearing a black face mask and standing behind a cluster of metal barricades on June 12, when protesters surrounded the Legislative Council building.
She heard what sounded like an explosion. Someone thrust a pair of goggles into her hands. 
Then she felt it for the first time: the tear gas that burned her skin and clouded her vision. 
Back home that evening, she was silent during dinner with her parents. She didn't want them to worry. They quarreled the night before after attending a memorial for a young woman who had died by suicide and linked it to the extradition bill in her goodbye note. 
""I wasn't out hanging out with my friends or watching a movie,"" Gigi said, fighting back tears. She couldn't understand why her parents - who took her to her first political rally in 2012, over the suspicious death of a Chinese dissident - were arguing rather than offering condolences. 
That 2012 rally, she said, was a ""turning point."" After that, she stopped being proud to call herself Chinese. Two years later, during the 79-day occupation of Hong Kong's streets demanding a direct vote for Hong Kong officials, Gigi ferried supplies back and forth to those camped out on the roads. 
Though isolated among her friends, who are losing interest in the demonstrations, she says she cannot focus on anything but the protests. 
So the tiny 16-year-old, just over 5 feet tall and weighing 90 pounds, has gone by herself to recent rallies. 
""After being tear-gassed, I was no longer afraid,"" she said. ""I understand that police may settle old scores later, but there is nothing else I can do."" 
The civil servant, 28
Chan has worked as an official at various border crossings into Hong Kong: the airport, ferry terminal and overland routes from the mainland.
This gave him a close-up view into what he sees as among the biggest threats facing his home: an incursion of long-term Chinese residents into Hong Kong, under a plan that allows 150 per day to arrive on ""one-way"" permits. ""We have no choice in who these people are,"" said Chan, who gave only his last name to avoid possible reprisals from his bosses or authorities. ""This is a policy that is very good for China, for them to brainwash Hong Kong by letting these people come here and spread their ideologies."" 
Almost 1 million Chinese had arrived through this program by the end of 2016, a sizable chunk of Hong Kong's roughly 7.3 million people.
They've served to reinforce a view in Hong Kong that the government is not concerned with the myriad issues locals face - sky-high rents, wages that cannot keep up - but work to please Beijing. 
Chan himself continues to live with his parents, sharing a room with siblings. His salary of $3,000 a month is decent but makes any other option impossible. He applied for his own place through a public housing program when he was 18 and received a notification just last year informing him that he finally got a unit. By then, he was over the maximum income. 
""If we are looking to take the next step in life, we need money, housing,"" he said. ""But these are not things we can imagine having."" 
On the streets, he takes extra caution - never on the front lines, always with a mask - fully aware he needs his job. 
He runs into colleagues often. They give him a knowing look. They understand the risk. One colleague was stopped and searched during protests in 2014. The officer who found his government ID immediately called his supervisor. He was not fired but received a ""black mark"" that probably stalled his career. 
Chan is celebrating his own small victory: getting his cautious mother out to a march for the first time on June 16. 
""It totally changed her mind,"" he said. ""She now realizes that there is abuse of power all around, from the government to the police.""

Hong Kongers ask for U.S. protection,"HONG KONG - Protesters gathered in the tens of thousands in central Hong Kong on Monday night, pleading with American lawmakers for the second time to pass legislation that supports the territory's democratic aspirations and punishes those who try to curtail it.
The demonstration, the first approved by authorities since the imposition of an anti-mask ban at all public gatherings, was marked by the sense of anguish that has gripped the movement after months of protesting. Instead of offering any further concessions, the government has instead expanded police powers and imposed more restrictions. 
As the crackdown on protests intensifies - with the arrest of more than 2,500, including 201 arrested in smaller-scale protests over the weekend - some see foreign pressure as the best hope for securing a democratic future for Hong Kong. 
""Our citizens do not have any kind of power to fight against the government,"" said Crystal Yeung, 23, standing among thousands of protesters spilling out onto roads from a small square that couldn't contain the rally. ""We are relying on the U.S. to punish those who are trying to breach the Hong Kong law.""
Protesters are specifically hoping for the passage of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, a piece of legislation that has broad bipartisan support. The bill, which will require the annual review of the special treatment afforded by Washington to Hong Kong and allow sanctions on those found to be ""suppressing basic freedoms,"" was fast-tracked through the House and could be discussed as soon as this week. In the Senate, it remains in committee. 
A large demonstration was first held in September in support of the bill, but protest organizers want to keep the pressure on as it makes its way through the congressional process. 
""The bill is necessary in order to give pressure on Chinese and Hong Kong government,"" said Ventus Lau, one of the organizers of Monday's demonstration. ""We have to do everything possible to push for a quick passing of the law.""
The international push is among several strategies employed by protesters as the Hong Kong government digs in its heels against any further concession to the movement. Protests began in June over a bill that would allow extraditions to mainland China, but have since swelled into a sustained effort at securing direct elections for Hong Kong and against increasingly harsh police tactics. Communities are divided, businesses are suffering and violence is increasing as the dissent drags on. 
Several Republican senators have recently visited Hong Kong, including Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Josh Hawley (Mo.), to observe the protests and speak to pro-democracy activists. Both are sponsors of the Human Rights and Democracy Act. The bill ""has come up in every single meeting"" with pro-democracy activists in the city, said Hawley, speaking in Hong Kong to a small group of reporters. He said the legislation could be voted on in the House as early as this week. ""It is obviously a very felt and urgent concern here in the city, and rightly so."" 

Prominent activist Joshua Wong, speaking at the rally, noted that when the bill was first floated, only a handful backed it. Today, more than 60 lawmakers have supported the legislation. 
""We owe it all to the blood and sweat spared by the front-line protesters and the peaceful protesters,"" Wong said, before leading the group into a cheer of ""Pass the act!"" Chants were so loud they could be heard miles from the rally's gathering point. 
Yet condemnation from American lawmakers and the pro-democracy movement's appeal to the Western world appears to be fueling Beijing's fears that Hong Kong's protests are the product of foreign meddling designed to weaken China. Speaking Sunday in Nepal, Chinese President Xi Jinping said any attempt ""to split China in any part of the country will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones.""
""And any external forces backing such attempts to divide China will be deemed by the Chinese people as pipe-dreaming!"" he added. 
Michael Tien, a pro-Beijing lawmaker who has supported pro-democracy positions like an independent inquiry into the police, says hawkish pro-establishment conservatives are feeding these theories of foreign interference to mainland Chinese authorities. 
""Beijing is convinced,"" he said. ""You are talking about Communist China. The one thing they hate is their own people going to a foreign government asking for help, and particularly this foreign government, who is trying to nail China."" 
President Trump has appeared to change his tone on Hong Kong several times in recent months. At the United Nations, he made strong comments in defense of the city's promised autonomy, saying the world ""fully expects"" Beijing will protect ""Hong Kong's freedom, legal system and democratic ways of life."" 
Speaking to reporters last week after a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, however, Trump said the situation in Hong Kong is ""going to take care of itself"" and has ""de-escalated.""
Hawley said the situation in Hong Kong is an ""urgent, pressing concern"" and would share his experiences with Trump.

Hong Kong leader invokes colonial-era emergency powers to ban masks,"Lam's action to quash protests prompts more anger in the streets
HONG KONG - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam invoked rarely used and sweeping emergency powers Friday to ban face masks at demonstrations, a move that sought to quell pro-democracy protests - but that quickly had the opposite effect, intensifying anger on the streets. 
Lam's decision to use colonial-era security powers further inflamed tensions roiling since June and heightened fears that Hong Kong's basic freedoms were being eroded. The order effectively expands police powers of arrest, even as many in Hong Kong fear that police are operating with impunity in their growing use of force.
It could also risk tainting Hong Kong's hard-won reputation as an open financial hub, already under strain because of the upheaval of recent months. 
""Protesters' violence has been escalating and has reached a very alarming level in the past few days, causing numerous injuries and leading Hong Kong to a chaotic and panicked situation,"" Lam said in a news conference. Behind her, a banner read: ""Treasure Hong Kong, End Violence.""
""As a responsible government, we have the duty to use all available means to stop the escalating violence and restore calm in society,"" she said.
Lam added that while the emergency ordinance is being enacted to ban the masks, Hong Kong itself was not in a state of emergency but instead in an ""occasion of serious danger"" that required such laws. Critics were quick to reject the measure and the use of emergency laws, citing a variety of reasons, the most fundamental being predictions that it won't work.
 On Friday night, a crowd of thousands peacefully marched more than three miles through the city in opposition to the announcement and to the government. The demonstration later turned violent in several districts, with protesters throwing gasoline bombs and setting fire to symbolic targets such as Chinese banks and subway stations.Police said a plainclothes officer had fired one shot in self-defense against a ""large group of rioters"" who threw a gasoline bomb at the officer, lighting his body on fire.
 The Hong Kong Hospital Authority said a 14-year-old boy had been shot in the thigh.
Thirty others were also sent to hospital for protest-related injuries. Three, including the gunshot victim, remain critical.
The entire subway network was shut on Friday night because of the unrest, and remained closed into Saturday morning. It left many stranded, forced to walk hours to get home.
The ban applies to rallies that have been given a go-ahead by police, as well as those that are unauthorized. The law authorizes a police officer to order the removal of facial coverings and take them off forcefully if the person does not comply. Noncompliance would be punishable by a fine or a jail term of up to a year. 
Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing lawmaker and a member of Hong Kong's executive council, said in an interview that such a ban should have come earlier in response to violence that has become ""totally unjustifiable."" 
""Freedom to express their views is not absolute,"" she said of the protesters. ""These people are interfering with our freedoms."" 
The mask ban was also pushed by a more hardcore group of Beijing loyalists within Lam's government who have accused her of being too soft on the unrest roiling the city.

In central Hong Kong, thousands of protesters filled the streets at lunchtime in a demonstration that continued into the evening after work hours. The protesters - some in heels or suits - left high-rise offices to join the march. Almost all of them wore masks. 
""This is adding fuel to the fire,"" Fernando Cheung, a pro-democracy lawmaker, said of the mask ban. ""The result is clear. This will mark the beginning of riots in Hong Kong.""
Lam's announcement came three days after widespread demonstrations across Hong Kong on Tuesday, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China - rallies that degenerated into street battles between protesters and police. Officers fired at protesters multiple times, using live ammunition for the first time since the demonstrations erupted in June. 
Beijing appeared to support the mask ban. Yang Guang, spokesman for China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said the chaotic situation there ""cannot continue endlessly.""
Protests began over a bill to allow extraditions to mainland China that many feared would erode the city's freedoms and the independence of its reputable legal system. They have since swelled into an all-out rebuke of Hong Kong's political system, in which leaders are handpicked by and answerable to Beijing. 
Demonstrators are pushing five demands, including an independent investigation of the police, but the government has responded only to one, the full withdrawal of the extradition bill.
On one major thoroughfare Friday, protesters marched down a four-lane road chanting ""Fight back, Hong Kong!"" and ""Fight for freedom!""

The emergency powers, which date to 1922 when Hong Kong was under British colonial rule, allow authorities to censor the media; seize property; take control of all transportation, manufacturing and trade in the city; and detain people for lengthy periods.
Lam did not rule out enacting other regulations to curb protests, including a curfew. 
Ronny Tong, a member of Hong Kong's executive council and a legal adviser to Lam, said the decision was made because ""something had to be done"" after the Tuesday shooting.

A run on gas masks in Hong Kong,"Authorities disrupt supply of protective gear into the territory

HONG KONG -
Gas masks, helmets, umbrellas, goggles: For anyone in Hong Kong, this is a checklist of essential protective equipment needed to partake in or
document
the
protests that have plunged the semiautonomous Chinese territory into political crisis. But to authorities seeking to choke off the movement, these items are ""tools for attacking people.""

So said Hong Kong police when they visited an industrial-equipment shop in the city's Kowloon district two weeks ago, the manager said. The man, who identified himself only as Peter to protect his business, said about 20 officers came to warn him that at ""this sensitive moment, you know how to do it. You have to be careful."" The message, he said, was clear: Stop selling gear to protesters.
Peter is doing nothing illegal - gas masks and helmets aren't prohibited or controlled goods - and police didn't respond to questions about efforts to squeeze supplies of protective gear.
But as protests intensify, along with Chinese government warnings of dire consequences, authorities are clamping down on the sale and importation of items they regard as resistance tools. In turn, vendors and the anti-government protesters are devising ways to circumvent equipment shortages and keep the front lines supplied.
""Nowadays, we work like smugglers,"" Peter said. ""We have to hide from the government.""
Gas masks have become especially coveted in the Asian financial hub, where demonstrators have faced off with police in violent clashes. Police have fired more than 1,800 rounds of tear gas since early June, when marches began over an extradition bill, since shelved but not fully withdrawn, that would allow suspects to be tried in China.
""There is no stock on the market"" of gas masks, said a 43-year-old shop owner who asked to be identified as Ho. When he pressed manufacturer 3M's official distributor in Hong Kong to restock, he said, ""they gave me only 30"" masks instead of the 100 sought. Visits by The Washington Post to several other shops yielded similar tales.
As protests become part of daily life, even in residential areas, there is demand for this gear even from beyond the front lines. ""There are many people buying these products,"" Ho said. ""People who are in suits, even.""
Pop-up shops
The scarcest items are full-face gas masks, followed by respirators and goggles. Helmets are relatively easy to obtain, but carrying them draws suspicion. Police regularly stop and search protesters.
To combat the shortages, Lee Ching Hei, 33, has a solution: pop-up shops.
Lee recently opened a business, National Calamity Hardware, employing a team of 10 to scour for and snap up gear in Hong Kong. At big protests, he rents a stall nearby and sells packets containing an eye mask, a respirator, gloves and a helmet. The packet costs him about $64, but he sells on a pay-what-you-can basis. The student price is $1.27.

He packages his supplies in black plastic bags. That way, protesters won't get stopped on the streets, and if the police want to know what's inside, they need to buy it. He said he charges government staff about 1,000 times the student rate.
""This is my business, not the government's,"" he said.
Police have taken increasingly aggressive action during clashes with protesters, whom Chinese officials have branded ""terrorists."" In June, after they detained and searched 358 protesters, police said they found items such as box cutters, razor blades and scissors, suggesting a planned confrontation. Officers also confiscated cable ties, shirts, masks and goggles.
Police also have characterized laser pointers - which protesters have used to distract officers and deter surveillance cameras - as a threat, by demonstrating at a news conference how light beams could burn a hole in a sheet of paper.
Chinese pressure
The police aren't the only source of pressure. Peter, of the Kowloon hardware store, said Chinese officials had been pressuring mainland companies not to ship certain goods to Hong Kong.
""All the shops and suppliers in the mainland already know there is a restriction on supplying some products to Hong Kong,"" he said, adding that his supplier had been interrogated by authorities in recent days.
In the hopes of getting half of his shipments, Peter says he orders goods shipped to 10 different addresses and sources them from Japan and Taiwan. He says many of the orders are seized by Chinese customs officials at the border. China customs officials didn't respond to a request for comment.
As shops in Hong Kong run low, protesters are turning online, with mixed success.
One protester, a postgraduate student who asked to be identified as Carl, 24, ordered two stab-resistant vests from China through Taobao, an e-commerce platform, in July, after a pro-Beijing mob attacked protesters in a subway station. The first one arrived. But an order he placed later that month was canceled after a delivery service rejected it.
Another protester, a 29-year-old who would go only by the pseudonym ""M,"" helps supply his comrades via the messaging app Telegram. He recently tried to order five masks through Taobao. M said the shop rejected the order because the delivery service indicated it was ""unable to ship masks, gloves, goggles or umbrellas"" to Hong Kong.
""You need to know some people to give it to you,"" he said. ""You cannot just get it.""
https://twitter.com/StephenMcDonell/status/1158315599346335746"">
The Post contacted five vendors in China on Taobao, and all said warehouses in China that processed shipments to Hong Kong were refusing to accept protest-related supplies destined for the territory.
Alibaba, the parent company of Taobao, didn't respond to questions from The Post about the supply limits. SF Express, a Chinese delivery-services company, declined to comment, as did Deppon, one of China's largest logistics companies.
Chinese restrictions on protective equipment could technically violate World Trade Organization rules, said Bryan Mercurio, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong's law school and an expert in international trade law. But under the national security provision in WTO rules, he said, it's ""likely that China would call this an essential security measure taken in time of emergency and prevail in any dispute.""
The tactics indicate that Beijing sees the Hong Kong crisis as ""an increasingly more dire situation,"" said Adam Ni, a China researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney. Restricting gear is part of China's ""multipronged strategy"" to ""put more pressure on the protesters.""
For now, Peter is not worried about the pressure. ""Hong Kong still has the Basic Law to protect us,"" he said, referring to the city's mini-constitution. Aside from needing to run his business, Peter said he supports the protesters, to whom he has given free helmets.

""This product is not attacking anyone, it's just for protecting. It's not right to forbid this stuff to import to Hong Kong,"" he said. ""Hong Kong is Hong Kong. Hong Kong is not China yet.""

Day of rage plunges Hong Kong into turmoil after police shoot protester,"HONG KONG "" For months, clashes between police and pro-democracy protesters here proceeded in a worrisome but almost predictable rhythm: Water cannons and tear gas dispersed throngs of masked demonstrators only to find them amassing again the next weekend despite an intensifying crackdown by the pro-Beijing government. 
That uneasy rhythm was jolted violently Monday.
In the morning, a police officer, claiming self-defense, shot a young, apparently unarmed protester in the abdomen at point-blank range, unleashing a chain of chaotic events as thousands of demonstrators clashed with riot police in the city's financial district and violent confrontations erupted at university campuses. Hours later, a man who was castigating protesters purportedly involved in vandalizing a rail station was doused with a flammable liquid and set on fire. Authorities later identified the victim as a 57-year-old construction worker and said they are investigating the incident as an 'attempted murder.' He was in critical condition. 
The immolation prompted Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam to tag the protesters as 'the people's enemy' "" words heard often from Beijing for those targeted for incarceration or worse. Lam, who said about 60 people were injured in Monday's clashes, said protesters were 'destroying society.' The government, she vowed, would not bow to such pressure. 
The unrest, which continued Tuesday morning at several Hong Kong universities, marks the worst violence in the city in decades, posing a quandary for China's leader, Xi Jinping, who has sought to bring Hong Kong to heel without resorting to
Tiananmen Square-style bloodshed. That confrontation left hundreds dead when the Chinese army beat, shot and crushed people gathered to protest government oppression.
Few fear a repeat of Tiananmen Square in Hong Kong, in part because social media and the ability to send images at lightning speed to a watching world may serve as a deterrent against such extreme government violence. But the developments on Monday "" captured on videos that quickly went viral "" have led many to worry that the government in Hong Kong may now feel justified, if not emboldened, to use ever more severe methods to put an end to the protests, once and for all.
'Senior officials have issued very draconian comments regarding the promulgation of a national security law and stepping up overall control,' said Willy Wo-Lap Lam, a professor of Chinese politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. 'This, together with the death of the student protester last week, is responsible for today's outbreak of disorder.'
Student protesters 'see no future ahead of them' because of the government's crackdown and refusal to compromise, added Lam (no relation to Carrie Lam). 'It seems like Beijing wants to use [the escalating protests] as an excuse to impose tougher measures.'

In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang declined to comment on the shooting of the protester, referring reporters to other government departments. The State Council office responsible for issues pertaining to Hong Kong did not respond to a request for comment.
'It's a police state in Hong Kong,' said Jerry, 26, a finance worker who joined the protests and gave only one name out of fear of retribution. 'Police are murderers.'
This is not the first time Hong Kong has experienced violence since the protests began this summer. A young woman became a symbol of the pro-democracy demonstrations after being shot in the eye by a rubber bullet fired by police. A protester was shot in a confrontation with an officer last month, and another fell to his death under questionable circumstances last week. Protesters have set fires in subway stations and vandalized businesses they suspect are owned by those sympathetic to Beijing.
Throughout more than five months of unrest, Beijing has exhorted Hong Kong's leaders to clamp down harder on the dissenters. Hong Kong authorities have obliged with thousands of arrests, draconian new laws, a barrage of tear gas and the detention of pro-democracy lawmakers. 
Yet far from blunting the democracy movement, the intensifying crackdown has prompted protesters to adopt more-aggressive tactics. With the deeply divided city descending into disorder, there has been no sign that Beijing might change tack or allow the Hong Kong government to offer a political compromise.
Protests began in June when the Hong Kong leader tried to push through a now-withdrawn extradition proposal that would have allowed criminal suspects to face trial in mainland China. But the movement has widened into an uprising against Beijing's encroachment on Hong Kong's autonomy, encompassing demands for full democracy and police accountability.
The unrest has pushed the city into recession. On Monday, numerous shops were closed, train lines were shut, and many workers were unable to reach their offices. Universities canceled classes. Police said a gasoline bomb was thrown into a subway car. A police officer who rode a motorcycle into a crowd of demonstrators was placed on leave pending an investigation. 
In central Hong Kong, as police retreated in vans at one point in the afternoon, crowds on the footbridges above chanted, 'Fight for freedom! Stand with Hong Kong!' Other onlookers shouted and threw debris at the vans. 
Protesters occupied a main thoroughfare, erecting barricades and setting fires near high-end hotels. As protesters blocked a road tunnel, they clashed with onlookers and taxi drivers. Some travelers abandoned their cars and walked with their suitcases.
In an editorial published Monday night, the nationalist Global Times newspaper compared the Hong Kong protesters to the Islamic State.
'We sternly condemn the mobs for their barbarity of setting those ordinary citizens, those who disagreed with them, on fire. Their appalling behavior has become indistinguishable from that of IS members,' the paper's Chinese-language edition said.
At a news conference Monday, police defended the officer's decision earlier in the day to open fire on the apparently unarmed protester, saying the demonstrator had wanted to take the officer's firearm. 

'He was under threat by two people; if he lost his gun, he would be under severe threat. Hence, he decided to fire,' Kwok Pak-chung, regional commander of Hong Kong Island, told reporters.
The condition of the man, who was struck in the abdomen, was not life-threatening, Kwok said.
In the United States, Congress is considering a bill that would pave the way for sanctions against people who undermine Hong Kong's autonomy. The bill, approved unanimously by the House of Representatives, would require the U.S. government to consider annually whether it should continue to treat Hong Kong as a trading entity separate from mainland China in response to political developments. However, the bill is stuck in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) so far has declined to bring it to a debate.
In a statement, the U.S. State Department condemned the violence in Hong Kong, urged the government to 'build on its dialogue' with the public, and said the United States is watching the situation unfold 'with grave concern.' Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus also urged Beijing to 'honor the commitments' made to Hong Kong, including a high degree of autonomy, rule of law and civil liberties, which are 'key to preserving its special status under U.S. law.'
Hong Kong is governed by a 'one country, two systems' arrangement, under which Beijing pledged to maintain the territory's relative freedoms and autonomy for half a century after its return to Chinese rule in 1997. But China has been tightening its grip, triggering anger in Hong Kong and uncertainty about its status as a global financial center. 
Amnesty International branded Monday's shooting as 'another shocking low for the Hong Kong police' and called for an urgent independent examination.
In the meantime, protesters continue to turn their fury on police.
'They're crazy. It's outrageous,' said Kong, a 27-year-old woman on her lunch break, referring to Monday's shooting. 'They've lost control.'

Hong Kong protesters apologize as risk of public backlash rises,"HONG KONG - After late-night mob scenes
marred a demonstration
that paralyzed this city's airport, protesters on Wednesday issued apologies as they fought to regain control over a narrative that seemed to be tilting in Beijing's favor for the first time.

The appeals, which included apologies to Hong Kong's police force, come as the struggle over public opinion approaches a climax. 
The protest movement has enjoyed wide support across Hong Kong society but has become steadily radicalized and fractured, and the Chinese government has sharply ramped up a propaganda effort in state media and on social networks to discredit and deflate it.
Hong Kong's airport ground to a near-halt for a second day Tuesday when protesters assailing perceived police brutality and government indifference occupied departure halls, sparking tense but largely peaceful confrontations with frustrated passengers, many of them stranded.
The mood turned darker by nightfall when protesters seized two men - one a reporter for Chinese state media, another they claimed to be a Chinese government agent - and clashed with police and paramedics who tried to evacuate the pair. At one point, protesters surrounded and kicked a police van, sparking hand-to-hand clashes with riot police, who fired pepper spray near the departure terminal.
The scenes, unfolding under the glare of the media in what is normally one of the world's busiest airports, provided ample ammunition for a Chinese government that has dismissed the outpouring of anger toward the local government and police in Hong Kong as a ""color revolution"" and a U.S.-backed ""terrorist"" scheme instigated by a handful of radicals.
On Wednesday, police warned that protesters arrested during the terminal fracas could face life in prison.
Seven men, ages 17 to 28, were detained, five charged with unlawful assembly and two with assault on police officers and possession of offensive weapons, said Mak Chin-Ho, assistant police commissioner.
Mak then read aloud from Hong Kong's aviation security ordinance, which provides for potential life sentences for those found guilty of breaching its provisions. 
Police also warned that anyone violating a court order barring disruption at the airport would be liable to be held in contempt of court.
With such threats, Beijing and its supporters in the Hong Kong government are dramatically raising the potential cost of taking part in protests.
The occupation at the airport remained subdued into Wednesday night, but scuffles between protesters and police that have defined the demonstrations in recent weeks continued in other parts of the city.
A few hundred protesters gathered in the Sham Shui Po area of Kowloon near a police station that has been a flash point for demonstrations. 
Some burned joss paper - part of the tradition of the Chinese Hungry Ghost Festival, which begins Thursday - printed with the faces of Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the police commissioner. They also shone laser pointers at the police station.
About 10 p.m. local time, police fired multiple rounds of tear gas. People rushed to cover the canisters with traffic cones, trying to contain the irritant smoke.
Earlier Wednesday, the largely leaderless protest movement distributed statements on social media appealing for forgiveness from international travelers, journalists and medical personnel at the scene of the airport chaos. 
Some even apologized to police, whose alleged brutality and refusal to apologize for the use of force in quelling demonstrations had fueled protesters' anger in the first place.
""After an entire night's reflection, we decided to bravely face our own shortcomings, and sincerely apologize to city residents that always supported us,"" one letter read. ""To police who were affected last night, we will deeply reflect and confront our problems.""
In the afternoon, Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy legislator whom Beijing portrays as a mastermind behind the unrest, scolded the protesters for undermining their cause by infuriating travelers and causing chaos at the transit hub.
""How would that actually help the Hong Kong cause?"" Mo told reporters. ""At a time when the protesters have been trying to garner support from the international community, you would be doing the opposite.""
The movement was entering a ""very, very scary"" moment, Mo said, floating the possibility that Beijing was engineering the escalation of tensions.
""Could there have been agents provocateurs?"" she said. ""Were we played into a trap? We don't know all the details yet.""
Mo later told The Washington Post that she did not think Beijing would send in armed forces to quell the protests but did not rule it out after what happened Tuesday.
On Wednesday, a Chinese government spokesman referred to the events at the airport as ""terrorism."" In a public post, a People's Liberation Army WeChat account called ""The People's Front Line"" noted that a garrison in Shenzhen was only 35 miles from the Hong Kong airport and that Chinese armed forces were obligated to respond to riots or terrorism.
Hours after a mob at the airport surrounded and beat Fu Guohao, a Chinese man later identified as a reporter for the Communist Party-run Global Times newspaper, Fu came to be seen as a martyr on Chinese social media.
The People's Daily, which owns the Global Times, launched a meme called ""I support the Hong Kong police, you can hit me now"" - the words Fu apparently said before he was beaten.
The hashtag attracted more than 300,000 replies on Weibo, China's Twitter-like service. 
The latest salvos extended efforts by Beijing to promulgate its position on Hong Kong.
Shortly after violence erupted during protests in June, trolls flooded Twitter with thousands of pro-police and pro-China posts, said Fu King-wa, a professor who studies social media at the University of Hong Kong.
In more recent days, Chinese state outlets such as the People's Daily have circulated fake news suggesting that a woman who was shot in the eye by police - possibly with a beanbag round - was, in fact, blinded by other protesters.
""Just last week, the narrative was about excessive police violence, but it's changing every day,"" Fu said. With the Global Times reporter now a hero in mainland China, ""it's become a full-on war of narratives,"" Fu said. ""It's a pendulum swinging back and forth.""
Divisions appeared to deepen in the youth movement. For hours Tuesday evening, masked protesters argued over whether to allow passengers to board their flights and whether to tie the hands of the suspected Chinese spy or free him.
At one point, a protester who confronted paramedics for helping the alleged spy was forcibly carried off by five others. 
After violence erupted near midnight, several young men embraced, bowed and apologized to an airport official who had been struck with water bottles and debris flung by others.
The unrest roiling Hong Kong erupted in June over a now-shelved proposal to allow suspects to be extradited to the mainland for trial. The movement has since grown into calls for investigations into police violence against protesters and resistance to what many see as Beijing's encroachment on Hong Kong's autonomy.

Xi struggles to win over Hong Kong,"Latest protests show failures of China's years of efforts to earn loyalty

BEIJING - Days after he pushed through a measure that would grant him lifetime rule, Chinese President Xi Jinping closed the Communist Party's 19th Congress in 2017 with a sweeping address that touched on the thorniest issues of all: Hong Kong and Taiwan.
In semiautonomous Hong Kong and practically independent Taiwan, Beijing would ""develop and strengthen the ranks of patriots who love our country,"" Xi promised the gathered party elite, to thunderous applause.
""Blood,"" Xi added, ""is thicker than water.""
Historic numbers of protesters in Hong Kong's streets and a political crisis engulfing its leader, Carrie Lam, in the past week have highlighted an enduring conundrum faced by Xi: For decades, Beijing has asked the former British colony for loyalty, if not love. Time and again, its people have responded with distrust, if not loathing.
Twenty-two years after regaining control over Hong Kong following more than 150 years of British rule, the Beijing government's efforts to win over residents' hearts and minds appear to be stumbling, raising doubts about not only Xi's long-term strategy for Hong Kong but also his overtures to Taiwan, the island he seeks to absorb. 
Since 2017, Xi has made similar pitches to encourage both populations - one under Chinese rule, one defiantly self-ruled - to embrace the Communist Party. He has guaranteed political semiautonomy, promised economic prosperity and appealed to shared Chinese ancestry.
He has failed to convince.
""Beijing has misinterpreted Hong Kong's culture, psyche and feelings,"" said Anson Chan, the former No. 2 official in Hong Kong. ""Hong Kong people will not bend to the will of the communist totalitarian state. If only Beijing would understand what makes Hong Kong tick, what are the values we hold dear, then they can use that energy to benefit both China and Hong Kong. 
""Instead, they have this mentality of control."" 
As many as 2 million people took to Hong Kong's streets Sunday, protest organizers said. They emerged in record numbers even after Lam, the Hong Kong chief executive backed by Beijing, suspended an extradition proposal that she said was not foisted on her by mainland China.
The demonstrators' complaints centered on Lam's perceived intransigence and the deployment of tear gas and rubber bullets earlier in the week by riot police. But a sea of placards and banners connecting Lam - a lifelong Hong Kong civil servant - to the Communist Party conveyed a far deeper suspicion of the Chinese government that has been bubbling since 2014.
That year, Beijing issued documents that outlined its supreme control over Hong Kong's courts and elections. In recent years, the reins have been further tightened on Hong Kong's freewheeling politics and media. 
""The extradition amendment was just the last straw on the camel's back,"" said Alan Leong, a former legislator and chairman of the opposition Civic Party.
With its authority unquestioned at home, the Communist Party struggles to deal with a territory with a mature and rambunctious civil society, Leong added. ""You talk reason with Hong Kong,"" he said. ""You don't rule Hong Kong."" 
A decades-long tracking poll by Hong Kong University shows that about 38 percent of Hong Kong citizens feel ""proud to be a citizen of China,"" compared with 47 percent in 1997, when excitement was high over the handover from Britain. Today, 55 percent of young people between 18 and 29 have a negative view of the central Chinese government, compared with 13 percent who see Beijing positively.
Chinese leaders have pondered for years how to reverse those trends. 
Beijing is accelerating an infrastructure and investment plan dubbed the ""Greater Bay Area"" that would open up jobs in dynamic technology hubs such as Shenzhen to residents of Hong Kong, a declining financial nexus with a gaping income gap. Earlier this year, pro-Beijing officials in Hong Kong reiterated the perennial suggestion of introducing more Chinese history classes in Hong Kong classrooms and promoting cultural exchanges with the mainland.
But attempts to ignite a ""love of country, love of Hong Kong,"" as the catchphrase goes, have often fizzled.
An effort in 2012 to introduce patriotic education was greeted with street protests and shelved. In 2014, a Chinese cabinet white paper requiring Hong Kong judges to ""love the country"" was denounced by the local legal community, including a former chief justice. Months after that, Hong Kong was rocked by a 79-day street occupation by young protesters demanding universal suffrage and by others who sought something more radical: independence.
In response to Hong Kong's defiance, the Chinese leadership appears likely to double down on patriotic education and hasten mainland investment and immigration into Hong Kong, said Willy Lam, an expert on Chinese politics at Hong Kong University.
It's a familiar playbook, Lam said. One extreme example is the restive region of Xinjiang, where the party has sought to instill patriotism in ethnic Uighurs through forced indoctrination on a massive scale, while promoting intermarriage and migration of Han, China's main ethnic group.

""Xi has realized the long-term solution is: Sinicize Hong Kong in much the same way as Tibet and Xinjiang,"" Lam said. ""Changing the makeup of the population will be the most effective.""

But the city poses a particular conundrum for a Communist Party that has staked its legitimacy on a narrative of defending ethnic Chinese against Western and Japanese colonial powers. The party believed it would be ""historical destiny, a historical inevitability,"" that Hong Kong would fall into its embrace after more than a century of British rule, said Maura Cunningham, a historian and co-author of ""China in the 21st Century."" 
""The problem is, Hong Kong has not gone willingly,"" Cunningham said. ""Instead we see the opposite happening.""
This week, the central government and its allies in Hong Kong downplayed the possibility that a genuine antipathy toward Beijing was on display on the city's broiling streets. 
A day after organizers said 1 million people took to the streets on June 9 chanting ""No China extradition,"" the state-run China Daily newspaper described the opposite, reporting that 800,000 people were supporting the bill. 
Meanwhile, China's Foreign Ministry and pro-Beijing legislators repeatedly described the uprising as fanned or engineered by Washington and London. On Monday, Ta Kung Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper backed by the Communist Party, blasted the U.S. consul general for meeting with activists and warned readers that ""citizens suspect U.S. intelligence agents to be involved in the riots.""
Yet even as Beijing's proxies heaped blame on foreign meddlers, its official voice in Hong Kong has recently turned conciliatory with the public. The liaison office said Friday that the central government paid ""great attention"" to the marches and rallies and ""supports, respects and understands"" Carrie Lam's decision to suspend the extradition bill ""to listen to more views from all sectors of society.""
On Monday, a young activist who rose to prominence as the face of the 2014 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong was released from jail. Upon his release, Joshua Wong, 22, immediately called for Lam to resign. 
The setback suffered this week by Hong Kong's pro-Beijing camp is reverberating in Taiwan, where President Tsai Ing-wen has seized the opportunity to warn about the dangers of engaging with Beijing. Taiwan's voters are mulling a choice between Tsai, who is bitterly opposed by China and leans toward declaring formal independence, and candidates who advocate rapprochement with their giant neighbor - and talking up the expected economic fruits.
In a landmark January speech aimed at Taiwan, Xi promised the island's population the same political freedoms as Hong Kong if the Taiwanese joined in unification talks. Otherwise, all options were on the table, Xi warned, including a military takeover.

That offer seemed hollow to hundreds of protesters who gathered Sunday outside the Taiwanese legislature, chanting, ""Today's Hong Kong is tomorrow's Taiwan.""

""More and more people are aware of the situation in Hong Kong,"" said Lin Fei-fan, an activist who organized the Taipei rally. ""Once Taiwan falls into Chinese hands, this will probably be our future.""

Beijing appears to prefer political solution in Hong Kong,"Official deflects query about possible military response to unrest
BEIJING - China signaled Monday that it wants a political rather than a military solution to the increasingly violent protests in Hong Kong, apparently putting the onus for dealing with the unrest squarely on the city's embattled leader.Beijing officials called for punishing ""radicals"" involved in the turmoil that has gripped Hong Kong in recent weeks. But they also acknowledged some causes of young people's discontent, including the need for more economic opportunity and affordable housing in the semiautonomous Chinese territory.
""Hong Kong will surely overcome all difficulties and challenges on its way forward,"" Yang Guang, a spokesman for Beijing's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said in an unprecedented news conference, adding that the central government ""firmly supports"" Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam. 
It was the first time that the office, which answers to China's State Council, or cabinet, has called a news conference.
""The ship of 'one country, two systems' will surely sail far and steady, despite winds and storms,"" Yang said, referring to the principle under which China agreed to give the former British colony a high degree of autonomy for 50 years following its return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. 
But signs of China's influence over Hong Kong abound. The Hong Kong and Chinese flags flew at half-staff above government offices Monday in mourning for Li Peng, the former Chinese premier known as ""the Butcher of Beijing"" for his role in the bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989. After eight consecutive weekends of protests in Hong Kong, the decision by Chinese officials to face reporters sparked speculation that Beijing might remove Lam, who has not addressed the news media for a week.
While the protests were building on Sunday, she was at a graduation ceremony for the Chinese People's Liberation Army summer camp at a barracks in Hong Kong.
She did not face the media on Monday, either, as officials in Beijing spoke about the situation in Hong Kong.

A spokesman for the Hong Kong government, replying to questions from The Washington Post, said it would not respond to ""speculative comments"" about Lam's leadership.
""The Government did in fact respond to the marches over the weekend and rejected the violence used by radical protesters,"" the spokesman added.
The protests in Hong Kong, triggered by now-suspended plans to allow the territory to extradite suspects to the mainland for trial, have plunged the Asian financial hub into its worst political crisis in decades. 
Along with Lam's resignation, protesters have demanded an independent inquiry into police actions and violence by pro-Beijing gangs toward demonstrators, as well as the full withdrawal of the extradition bill.
The demonstrations have widened into a broader movement calling for greater democratic freedoms, amid concerns that Hong Kong's liberties and rule of law are coming under growing pressure from Beijing.
In clashes over the weekend, police fired tear gas and projectiles at thousands of protesters in a densely packed neighborhood close to downtown. 
Protesters responded with bricks, set fire to carts that they pushed close to police lines and shot at police with crossbows. Police arrested at least 49 people on Sunday, in addition to 11 arrested during a demonstration on Saturday - the most detained in a single weekend since the start of the upheaval. 
More protests are planned for this week, including one organized by Hong Kong civil servants.
On Monday, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office reiterated its calls for Hong Kongers to adhere to the rule of law. ""We must not sit idly by and let a small number of people trample on this important value,"" Yang said.
Analysts said the response showed that Beijing did not have an effective strategy for dealing with the unrest.
""They don't have any short-term answers to the current impasse,"" said Adam Ni, a China security expert at Macquarie University in Sydney. ""If they go for a hard-line approach, it's going to backfire. But if they are conciliatory, the protesters will think Beijing is showing weakness, and they will demand more.""
Yang deflected a question about whether the central government was considering sending in the Chinese military to put down the demonstrations.
""There is clear provision, but I will not go into details. Just go and have a look"" at the laws, he said. ""The most pressing task for the moment is to punish violence and maintain order.""
China maintains a military presence in Hong Kong, and China's Defense Ministry suggested last week that it was open to using troops to quell the unrest, saying the protests were ""intolerable"" and that the army would mobilize troops to restore public order if requested by the Hong Kong government.Some in Hong Kong said it was notable that Beijing officials, rather than Lam, did the talking on Monday.
Lam ""has almost disappeared before the camera and before the media in the past month, even though a lot of people expect her government should be more decisive in handling the chaos,"" said Ivan Choy, a political scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
Beijing's remarks appeared designed to show that ""the central government is keeping a close eye on the things happening in Hong Kong"" and to send a firm message of support toward Lam and her administration, Choy said. 
Instead, it served to further weaken her position, Choy said, by showing that Beijing has a ""systematic will"" when it comes to Hong Kong, while the territory's own authorities have all but disappeared.
The protests in Hong Kong, the biggest political crisis since the handover and a significant challenge to the Communist Party of China, come at a difficult time for Beijing.
The protests are boosting the prospects of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, who leans toward independence from China and is up for reelection next year. They also coincide with a protracted trade war with the United States.

HONG KONG - Police used force early Tuesday to clear thousands of protesters in and around Hong Kong's legislative building after some broke in and occupied it Monday, the 22nd anniversary of the semiautonomous city's return to Chinese rule.
The escalation has brought Hong Kong into unprecedented and uncertain territory, and represents the biggest test of Beijing's grip over the global financial hub and the status under which it operates.
On Tuesday morning, Hong Kong's streets were reopened, the rush-hour traffic flowing through like on any other day.
But outside the Legislative Council building, piles of broken umbrellas, traffic cones and jumbled barricades zip-tied together by protesters littered the sidewalk. Cleanup and repair operations, which are expected to take weeks, had begun with garbage trucks carting away the wreckage. Police officers stood around the perimeter of the building, where tempered-glass doors and windows shattered by demonstrators had been cordoned off by flimsy blue-and-white tape. Graffiti denouncing the police could be seen just inside the major public entrance to the building.
Mostly young protesters on Monday smashed their way through metal barricades and glass doors surrounding the Legislative Council building. As they wrote graffiti on walls, tore down portraits of pro-Beijing officials and emptied rooms of chairs and desks, they pushed weeks of tensions and mass demonstrations here to a new level. 
The demonstrators occupying the complex wrote a declaration that included a call for overthrowing the ""puppet Legislative Council and the Government,"" and they vowed to stay. But just after midnight Tuesday, police equipped with riot shields, tear gas and projectiles began removing protesters from streets surrounding the complex, sending them fleeing. Officers then retook the complex, stopping and frisking thosewho remained nearby. More than 500,000 demonstrators marched peacefully across the city Monday and forced major thoroughfares to shut down.
The scenes of defiance were the latest indication that anger here, sparked by plans to allow extraditions to China but now incorporating broader concerns about Hong Kong's autonomy and Beijing's influence, will not be easily quelled. 
The protesters smashed shutters, broke windows and ripped down metal fencing around the Legislative Council building, eventually forcing their way in. They repeatedly tried to slam against metal shutters and pry them open as riot police stood guard.
At some point during the evening, officers appeared to vacate their posts. By 9:30 p.m., dozens of demonstrators wearing yellow hard hats and carrying umbrellas - a symbol of 2014 pro-democracy protests - had entered the building and were roaming the complex. They spray-painted wood-paneled walls with graffiti cursing the Hong Kong government. Outside, protesters cheered as more windows and doors were broken. 
Later Monday night, police said the building had been ""violently attacked"" and ""illegally entered."" In a tweet, they warned that they would conduct a sweep with ""reasonable force"" and urged people to leave the area.
The Hong Kong government condemned the ""violent acts"" as the work of ""radical protesters."" At a 4 a.m. news conference with the city's police chief, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam criticized protesters for vandalizing the Legislative Council building.
""I hope community at large will agree with us that with these violent acts that we have seen, it is right for us to condemn it and hope society will return to normal as soon as possible,"" she said.
Protesters, however, vowed to press on.
""Unless universal suffrage and a just election system are in place, we shall never stand down,"" they said in a statement.

Monday's chaotic demonstrations came the day that officially marks the territory's return to Beijing.
Before dawn, riot police and hundreds of protesters had gathered on roads leading to a square where the Hong Kong and Chinese flags were set to be raised. The ceremony, which was attended by Hong Kong leaders and dignitaries including Lam, was moved indoors as protesters gathered. Officials said the event, which had never been held inside before, was moved because of ""inclement weather."" 
As helicopters carrying the flags flew over, protesters
waved middle fingers at them. Earlier in the morning, demonstrators had replaced a Chinese flag with a black flag featuring a withered Bauhinia flower, a riff on the Hong Kong flag. That flag was still flying on Monday night. 
Hospitals and police have not confirmed the number of injuries from the clashes. Police said in a statement that protesters earlier Monday had pelted officers with objects containing an ""unknown liquid,"" which made their skin swollen and itchy. Thirteen officers were treated at a hospital and discharged. In recent years, the July 1 anniversary of the 1997 handover of sovereignty has been marked by marches featuring hundreds of thousands of people who want to uphold Hong Kong's unique status, democratic characteristics and relative freedoms compared with those of mainland China.
But after weeks of spiraling tensions in the territory, Monday's protests took on a different flavor. In the face of an increasingly assertive Beijing, protesters viewed the occasion as their final chance for a massive stand against a government they believe is not working in their interests.
""We are exhausted,"" said a 22-year-old protester who did not want to give his name for fear of retribution from authorities. ""But today's march is special. We think it will be the last one that people will come out [to] on a large scale. We have to show our disappointment and anger.""
An hour into the planned afternoon march, police sent out a warning, discouraging people from joining the procession.
""Police absolutely respect people's freedom of assembly, procession and expression of opinion in a peaceful and orderly manner,"" the statement said. ""However, Police's risk assessment indicates that there is a serious safety threat.""
Yet demonstrators turned up in the tens of thousands, filling Hong Kong's main roads with a swell of shuffling people once again. Some in the march - the elderly, parents with children - broke off to join the young protesters gathered on Harcourt Road, the main city thoroughfare that they have taken over several times in the past month.
They carried signs that read ""We Shall Never Surrender"" and ""Hong Kong Is Resilient."" 
 Lam has postponed the extradition plans, but demonstrators have continued to return to the streets in rallies like the one held Monday - the revival of a pro-democracy movement that is now advocating for a freer Hong Kong, for Lam to step down and for police to be investigated for their handling of the street protests, among other demands. The protests were once again well organized. Participants set up first-aid, water and food stations, and used hand signals to indicate police mobilization or use of pepper spray. Demonstrators urged one another and members of the public not to take photos of the crowd to ensure their anonymity.
As protesters attempted for hours to storm the legislative building, human chains passed supplies including umbrellas, gloves, helmets and protective masks to assist their efforts. 
More than 80 people were injured in a clash between police and protesters in mid-June, drawing the ire of many in Hong Kong who turned up at a large rally days later to denounce what they consider police brutality against students.
Police appeared initially restrained on Monday by contrast. 
Inside a convention center where the anniversary ceremony was held in the morning, Lam, flanked by Hong Kong and Chinese officials, raised a glass of champagne to toast the occasion. At a reception that followed, she said that she had reflected on the disputes and that she understands ""the need to grasp public sentiments accurately.""
""After this incident, I will learn the lessons and ensure that the government's future work will be closer and more responsive to the aspirations, sentiments and opinions of the community,"" she said. Work to make Hong Kong's governance ""more open and accommodating"" will start immediately, she added. 
She has not indicated that she would step down or fully withdraw the extradition plans. Analysts and some in her government say she has angered Beijing by misjudging the widespread and vociferous opposition to the extradition bill.
Other demonstrators, however, have marched to back the police. On Sunday, thousands showed up in support of the Hong Kong police and expressed appreciation for their efforts in managing the civil disobedience in recent weeks. 
 In mainland China, there was no mention of Monday's protests on social media. State media played up news of Sunday's pro-police rally and highlighted official celebrations of the anniversary of Hong Kong's return.

On several prior occasions, protesters surrounded and blocked off the police headquarters, threw eggs at the building and spray-painted surveillance cameras. 
Pro-democracy protesters think that Hong Kong's relative autonomy, which is guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, is at stake. Many here want Hong Kong to be able to choose its own leader and to abolish the current system in which chief executives such as Lam are selected by a committee, out of a small pool of candidates handpicked by Beijing. 
Lam, speaking Monday, said Hong Kong is ""backed by the motherland and open to the world"" and has benefited from the ""one country, two systems"" framework.
""I and the [Hong Kong] government will double our efforts to restore people's confidence and get Hong Kong off to a new start,"" she added. 
The 22-year-old protester, however, scoffed at Lam's comments, dismissing her as a pawn of Beijing. 
""She has not responded to us, or learned how to engage with us,"" he said.

"During protest, Hong Kong police blast mosque with blue dye","HONG KONG - Hundreds of thousands of pro-democracy protesters returned to the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday, defying a ban on assembly before being violently dispersed by police tear gas and a water cannon.

A police water cannon filled with stinging blue dye blasted protesters along a major thoroughfare in Kowloon. It also hit a small group standing guard outside a mosque - an important spiritual nexus for the city's largely South Asian Muslim community - leaving bystanders choking and vomiting.
Protesters vandalized businesses viewed as supporting Beijing, threw molotov cocktails at police stations, set barricades on fire and smashed up subway stations in chaotic scenes that have become familiar to the city after five months of sustained protest.The huge turnout, estimated by organizers at around 350,000 and including families, children and the elderly, showed that the movement maintains widespread support in the face of the increasingly violent tactics of protesters and the escalating use of force by police. 
Marchers made a sea of colored umbrellas through the narrow streets of the city's Kowloon area, which are lined with malls and international hotels. Some waved Catalonian flags in solidarity with the independence protests in that region of Spain.
In contrast to previous demonstrations, tensions escalated quickly, with clashes erupting long before sunset. By late afternoon, protesters were throwing molotov cocktails and bricks at police stations.
In a show of their increasing sophistication, protesters also produced power tools to drill metal railings into road surfaces for sturdier barricades to hold back police.
Hong Kong authorities said protester violence has been escalating. In a statement released just after midnight, the government said police had intercepted a vehicle ""with a large number of petrol bombs,"" and ""suspected explosive items"" were found around the city. There were no reports that any explosives were detonated.""Members of the public should not fall foul of the law by participating in unauthorised processions and assemblies in order not to give rioters the chance to commit crimes,"" the government said.
The months of protests began in opposition to a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. The Hong Kong government said the legislation, since withdrawn, was in response to a brutal murder of a young Hong Kong woman by her boyfriend in Taiwan. He has since voluntarily surrendered to Taiwanese authorities, despite the lack of the extradition treaty. 
Protests have swelled into a comprehensive rejection of Hong Kong's leaders, who many say act only in Beijing's interest, and revived a demand for direct elections in the semiautonomous territory. 
""We don't care whether they will approve the march or not. Our fight for justice in the face of tyranny goes on anyway,"" said Victor, 24, who returned to his home city from New Zealand to participate in the protest. ""The movement is spreading everywhere, all around the world.""
Sunday's protest came days after the leader of the Civil Human Rights Front, Jimmy Sham, was attacked by a group of men wielding hammers in the Mong Kok neighborhood. The beating left Sham, who is contesting a seat in next month's local elections, splayed on the street and covered in blood. It was the second time in recent months that he had been targeted. He was released from the hospital on Sunday but will continue to need medical treatment and physical therapy. 
""The message was clear that someone or some forces behind the scenes are trying to threaten protest organizers and democracy activists,"" said Eric Lai, vice convener of the Civil Human Rights Front. ""We cannot identify who was behind the attacks, but the objective is to create a chilling effect on those who are making demands for justice."" 
The CHRF, founded in September 2002 in opposition to proposed national security legislation, is an umbrella organization made up of several civil society groups. While the protest movement has remained leaderless and largely decentralized, the group has played a major role in organizing the largest marches.
Online rumors that Sham's attackers appeared to be South Asian prompted fears that ethnic minorities could be targeted for reprisal. In response, protesters called for greater outreach to non-Chinese Hong Kongers and to remain vigilant against attempts to incite violence against them.Volunteers, minorities, protesters and others stood at the gate to the Kowloon Mosque during the protest, holding signs pleading for people not to attack any ethnic minority people or buildings. While some handed out supplies, others led chants, and passing marchers loudly cheered them on. 
But only a few hours later, a police truck unleashed a cascade of blue water at the mosque, hitting the people who had been guarding it. The blue dye is used to identify demonstrators.
Passersby were left choking and vomiting, and the steps of the mosque were stained blue. Phillip Khan, a prominent businessman in the Muslim community standing outside the mosque, called the act an ""insult to Islam.""
""It is ridiculous. The police just went mad,"" said Jeremy Tam, a pro-democracy lawmaker, his pants and shoes soaked blue and his eyes bloodshot. ""We came here to protect the mosque against protesters, but it was the police that did this.
""Why make such a scene when it was just peaceful?""
Nawaz, a 36-year-old Pakistani man who has lived in Hong Kong for 25 years, emerged to see the blue-stained road after the cannon had sped past.
""I have such a bad feeling seeing this,"" he said. ""This is our religion. How can they do this? Only the police are giving us pressure, not the protesters."" Like others, he declined to give his family name for fear of backlash from authorities.
Police said in a statement later that the mosque was ""accidentally affected"" and they had ""immediately contacted"" the chief imam and Muslim community leaders to ""clarify the situation and to show"" concern. Tense scenes unfolded outside the Tsim Sha Tsui police station by early afternoon, as protesters marching past shouted chants calling the police gangsters and demanding the force be dissolved. Police use of force has emerged as a key complaint for many in Hong Kong, who say officers are acting with impunity to suppress the movement. 
A protester urinated on the station's gates, and police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. Tear gas streamed down the Ladies Market, a popular tourist attraction, sending unprotected stall-holders and shoppers scurrying for cover. Some were assisted by protesters and volunteer medics.
Many demonstrators, facing the possibility of being penned in by police, found sanctuary in little businesses that support the protests or huddled in overflowing restaurants, cafes and bars where they could change their clothes and wait for reports on Telegram indicating how they could get safely away while avoiding the police.
Sunday's protest, planned initially to show opposition to a recently enacted law
banning the use of face masks at public gatherings, continued for hours from a starting point in the Tsim Sha Tsui neighborhood. April, 27, and her boyfriend, William, 29, stood near a park where protesters first gathered. The couple said they had held off getting married or having kids out of concern over the direction of Hong Kong and the possibility of raising children in a city where Beijing's grip is tightening.
""The situation for future generations is turning worse very quickly. We are really worried,"" April said. ""If we don't fight today, there won't be a future generation.""
As night fell around the Kowloon Mosque, a group of volunteers began clearing the pools of caustic blue dye, using cloths to remove it from the mosque's metal gates and brooms to sweep it into drains. Some gagged as they worked, but the crowd of volunteers grew by the hour.

Hong Kong has been growing more fearful of Chinese control for over decade,"After more than 150 years as a British colony, Hong Kong became a ""special administrative region"" of China in July 1997. At the time, many in the bustling city and global financial hub weren't sure what to make of their new Communist Party overseers in Beijing.
On Monday, exactly 22 years later, a crowd of protesters smashed their way into the central chambers of Hong Kong's parliament. Inside, they spray-painted graffiti critical of Hong Kong's government, and one protester placed the old colonial flag of Hong Kong over the city's official emblem.
The scenes mark a new level of intensity for protests that began this year in response to a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. The storming of the Legislative Council presents the strongest challenge to Chinese control of Hong Kong, and many have argued that it is a culmination of more than a decade of popular frustration over repeated encroachments by Beijing on Hong Kong's special status.
2003: Proposed changes to national security law spark huge protests

On July 1, 2003, the sixth anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong, an annual protest held on the day swelled to its largest number, with an estimated half a million people turning out.
Many were motivated to protest proposed changes to Hong Kong's post-colonial constitution known as the Basic Law. The legislation, backed by Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong's chief executive at the time, focused on Article 23 of the Basic Law, which deals with national security.
The bill would have criminalized ""subversion"" against the Chinese government.
After mass protests, however, Hong Kong's legislature indefinitely shelved the plan.
2014: Umbrella Movement protesters call for democratic reforms

Hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets between September and December 2014, bringing much of the city to a standstill for 79 days in the biggest protests in years.
Demonstrations had begun in response to Beijing's announcement that the candidates to become Hong Kong's next leader, due to be selected in an election in 2017, would be vetted by Chinese authorities.
Protesters demanded instead that they should have full suffrage and direct elections in line with promises China made before the handover.
The backlash to the move marked the ascent of a new generation of young protesters in Hong Kong who borrowed the language of the Occupy movement and added their own touches, such as
using the umbrella as a symbol. 
This time, however, the protests didn't lead to concessions.
2015: Booksellers in Hong Kong targeted by Beijing

In 2015, a number of people connected with a Hong Kong publisher and shop that sold books banned in mainland China went missing. 
Although the books were not sold in mainland China, tourists often snapped them up on visits to Hong Kong, eager for unvarnished and gossipy tales of Communist Party leaders.
Only later did the Chinese government admit that five booksellers had been detained for alleged criminal activity. Notably, the apparent arrest of at least one bookseller within Hong Kong by Chinese agents violated the ""one country, two systems"" policy in place after the handover from Britain.
""We now have confirmation of what we always suspected,"" Anson Chan, a former chief secretary of Hong Kong, told The Washington Post at the time.
""We are all vulnerable to arbitrary arrest by mainland operatives, even in Hong Kong, and we cannot expect any help or protection from our own local authorities.""
2017: Xi Jinping makes his first visit as China's leader


Chinese leader Xi Jinping visited Hong Kong in summer 2017 for the 20th anniversary of the handover.
As he was greeted by the territory's largest military parade, he gave a speech in which he emphasized that Chinese sovereignty was paramount.
""When our country does well, Hong Kong will do even better,"" Xi said during his visit, his first since becoming Chinese leader in 2013.
Xi also used the visit to swear in Hong Kong's new leader, Carrie Lam. Lam, who had been elected under the rules that led to the protests in 2014, had the backing of much of the city's pro-Beijing business and political elite.
The visit from the Chinese leader came amid moves that appeared designed to better connect Hong Kong with mainland China, including a high-speed rail link and a new 34-mile bridge that Xi opened the next year.
2019: Proposed changes to extradition law lead to new protests

The most recent round of protests in Hong Kong began in June in response to a proposal that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China - an idea that led to further worries that Hong Kong's system of law and order was becoming subservient to Beijing's harsher rules.
Lam, the Hong Kong chief executive who had supported the extradition change, has put the measure on hold and apologized for how the government handled its rollout.
But the protests have swelled into something bigger, and there are widespread calls for her to resign.
As leader of Hong Kong, Lam had pushed for a variety of pro-Beijing legislation, including one measure that would have criminalized mockery of the Chinese national anthem.

"In Hong Kong, questions grow over leader's response to protesters","With her city facing an abyss, in her words, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam strode to the microphone this week and reasserted that urgent steps were needed to pacify
protests
that have plunged the Asian financial hub into its worst crisis in decades.

What she must not do, she said, is compromise. She wasn't ignoring protesters' demands, she said. She was rejecting them outright.
""It is not a question of not responding; it is a question of not accepting those demands,"" she said.
As Hong Kong's political upheaval stretches on, the refusal of Lam and her government to entertain any concessions that might restore calm has surprised even pro-establishment voices and moderates. Her stance has left many wondering whether Lam is unable - rather than unwilling - to make decisions on the most pressing matters affecting the semiautonomous Chinese territory.
""Beijing thinks the protests will burn out as a result of the regime's intransigence and provocations,"" said Kenneth Chan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University and a former pro-democracy lawmaker. ""The ultimate game is to imbue in society a collective sense of hopelessness [by] stonewalling the protests.""
Lam's office, in response to a request to elaborate on her Tuesday remarks, said her government has responded to protesters, particularly by stopping work on the extradition bill that sparked the unrest. It said it hoped that dialogue with ""people from all walks of life, including those with different political views,"" would help address differences.
Two years into her term as chief executive, Lam, a former civil servant, is under immense pressure to ease tensions in Hong Kong. Tourists are canceling trips, forcing hotels to put staff on unpaid leave. Businesses are hurting; some are sharpening exit plans. Residents have become casualties of tear gas. More strikes and protests are planned in the coming days.
China's ruling Communist Party has issued ominous threats to try to stamp out the protests. On Thursday, the People's Liberation Army conducted its 22nd troop rotation into the Hong Kong garrison since 1997, state media said. Pictures showed armored personnel carriers moving between the border city of Shenzhen and Hong Kong, underscoring fears of a Chinese military intervention. The paramilitary People's Armed Police have been practicing crowd-control tactics at a Shenzhen stadium in recent weeks.
And, in a widening crackdown, activists Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow, student leaders who rose to prominence in pro-democracy street protests five years ago, were arrested Friday morning, their party said in a statement.With the crisis threatening to tip Hong Kong into recession and public grievances playing out in street clashes with police, there is little indication that Lam intends to give ground. Whether she has the authority to do so, political analysts say, is central to Hong Kong's status and its ability to exercise a ""high degree of autonomy,"" to which the city is entitled under the terms of its 1997 return to Chinese sovereignty. Lam, who is appointed by a committee mostly loyal to Beijing rather than by popular vote, said Tuesday that she had not lost control.
Regina Ip, a member of Hong Kong's Executive Council and a pro-Beijing lawmaker, said top leaders are ""united"" behind Lam and her decision.
Hardcore demonstrators ""are finding every conceivable excuse to stage more protests,"" she said in an interview. ""That's why I really wonder if giving in to any of their demands will stop their protests.""
Lam has tried to kick-start a ""platform for dialogue,"" hoping to get protesters to talk with her government. At her residence Saturday, Lam held the first meeting aimed at establishing this platform, attended by 19 politically moderate local luminaries.
More than half the people in attendance, one participant told The Washington Post, were in favor of addressing two key protester demands: complete withdrawal of the extradition bill that triggered the protests and an independent investigation that would include scrutiny of police tactics. Lam has suspended the bill, which would have allowed Hong Kong to extradite criminal suspects to mainland China, but has stopped short of withdrawing it from the legislative agenda.At the Saturday meeting, Lam appeared to understand that fully withdrawing the bill would be effective in easing tensions, but she was more resistant to protesters' calls for an independent inquiry into the months of violence for fear of aggravating the police force, said Tik Chi-yuen, chairman of the centrist political group Third Side, who was present. Police have said that an existing internal mechanism for investigating complaints is sufficient.
Given her ""soft approach"" in the weekend meeting, Tik said he was surprised when Lam, in her news conference just days later, appeared to flatly reject the idea of meeting any of the protesters' five demands.
Efforts to start a dialogue without concessions would be ""meaningless"" and ""not effective,"" Tik said. ""You cannot achieve anything.""
Lam's refusal to budge has perplexed even some in her own camp.
""There's a consensus that the government can do two things, but she refuses to do anything,"" said Felix Chung, a pro-Beijing lawmaker who also represents the textiles and garment industry.
Senior government officials, he added, have urged her to start work on an independent inquiry and formally withdraw the bill. ""It is very difficult to have anything done at this moment if she still insists on not doing anything simple.""Surveys show that Lam may have limited ability to connect with the majority in her city. An August survey released this week by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Program, an independent pollster, put Lam's approval rating at 24.6 percent - the lowest among any post-colonial leader. Net trust in the Hong Kong government is also at its lowest since records began in 1992.
Lam has other options to end the crisis. The pro-government Sing Tao Daily newspaper floated the idea of invoking the colonial-era Emergency Regulations Ordinance, which grants sweeping powers to the chief executive.
Lam on Tuesday did not dismiss the idea, saying that the government would look into all Hong Kong laws that could ""stop violence and chaos."" This month, she asked at a news conference whether protesters ""really want to push [Hong Kong] into an abyss.""
Under the law, the chief executive is granted control over detentions and deportations, arrests and transportation hubs, as well as the ability to censor publications. The ordinance was used in 1967 during leftist riots in which 51 people were killed and nearly 900 injured.
The discussion on resorting to emergency legislation is ""a highly contentious if not dangerous move"" that will have an ""immediate and profound impact on Hong Kong's reputation as a free society and rule of law,"" said Peter Cheung, a political scientist at the Education University of Hong Kong.

In private meetings, Lam has expressed optimism that protests will die down once school reopens next month. Yet students are planning a mass boycott of classes, and protest organizing is fervent ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in October.

Hong Kong activists ask Congress to get tougher,"Advocates push U.S. lawmakers to safeguard territory's rightsHong Kong democracy activists presented their case before a congressional commission Tuesday for tougher U.S. action, including possible sanctions, to counter China's steady erosion of the territory's freedoms, as momentum builds in Washington for a more robust response.
Veteran activist Joshua Wong, musician Denise Ho, academics and a student union representative appeared before the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which has bipartisan leadership.
In their testimonies, they echoed Hong Kong protesters who have raised alarm over alleged police brutality and China's efforts to erode the ""one country, two systems"" framework under which Hong Kong is supposed to enjoy a high level of autonomy.
""Beijing shouldn't have it both ways, reaping all the economic benefits of Hong Kong's standing in the world while eradicating our freedoms,"" said Wong, who as a teenager in 2014 was the face of Hong Kong youths calling for changes to allow the direct election of Hong Kong's leadership. He was arrested last month in a crackdown against prominent activists, although he has not played a central role in the wave of protests that has gripped the city since June.
""Our most important demand is genuine structural change in Hong Kong, which means free elections,"" he added. 
Ho added that the protests, sparked by a now-shelved proposal to allow extraditions to mainland China, has ""always been about fundamental conflicts"" between differing values - the Chinese authoritarian model on one hand, and Hong Kong, which has a ""deep attachment"" to its freedoms, rule of law and human rights.
""This is not a plea for so-called foreign interference,"" Ho said. ""This is a plea for democracy. This is a plea for the freedom to choose.""

As a live stream of the hearing played on YouTube, the comments page flooded with comments coming in every second urging the U.S. to ""liberate Hong Kong."" 
Protesters have been lobbying the U.S. government to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which seeks to impose sanctions such as asset freezes and visa bans on those found to be ""suppressing basic freedoms"" in Hong Kong.The bill would require an annual review of the special treatment Washington affords Hong Kong under the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, including trade and business privileges that do not extend to mainland China. Protesters who have been arrested for participating in Hong Kong's democracy movement in recent years could also be protected if the bill passes, as the legislation would make them eligible for U.S. visas despite their criminal records.
Beijing has railed against ""foreign influence"" in the Hong Kong protests, although there is scant evidence that the movement is externally funded or supported, and says it considers the situation in Hong Kong to be solely the purview of China. The Hong Kong government also has stressed that foreign legislatures should not interfere in ""internal affairs.""
The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which is now in the Senate, has wide-ranging bipartisan support, including from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who have both appealed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to pass the bill. Several prominent senators have added their names to a list of co-sponsors.In his prepared testimony before the commission, Sunny Cheung, a spokesman for a group of Hong Kong student unions, ended his testimony by evoking Thomas Jefferson.
""Hong Kong people will take every step, with the last inch of our efforts, to fight for our democracy and freedoms,"" he said. ""As Thomas Jefferson once said, he would be forever against any form of tyranny. I believe this is a time for Americans to stand with Hong Kong""

"While Beijing weighs Hong Kong's defiance, fears rise of a strong put-down","Leaders must decide whether to intervene as protests grow unruly
HONG KONG - The Chinese government decried protests in Hong Kong as a ""flagrant challenge"" to the system under which it allows the territory a degree of autonomy, and it backed a crackdown on the ""violent criminals"" who rampaged through Hong Kong's legislature.
In another sign that it is increasingly tiring of restraint, Beijing also issued strong warnings to world powers to stay out of its domestic affairs, noting that Western countries have used ""extremely strict"" measures to quell protests. 
The warnings underscore a quandary for Beijing: How long can and should Hong Kong be allowed to remain so defiant before it becomes ungovernable by Beijing's strict standards?

Fears are mounting that President Xi Jinping's government might act to put an end to the protests, sparked three weeks ago by a law that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. 
""I am concerned,"" said Anson Chan, a former chief secretary of Hong Kong who backs full democracy for the territory. ""I hope that the chief executive will speak on behalf of the Hong Kong people and tell Beijing that they have nothing to fear from Hong Kong's prosperity or from allowing us one man, one vote.""
Ronny Tong, a member of Hong Kong's cabinet and a legal adviser to chief executive Carrie Lam, issued an even sterner warning. 
""When there is trouble in Hong Kong, when things turn sour and there is violence in the streets, our fear is that if the police are unable to control what is happening here, there's a remote risk that the [Chinese army] would get involved,"" Tong said before Monday's escalation. 
Perhaps not coincidentally, China's People's Liberation Army held an open day Monday at its Hong Kong Garrison, performing military maneuvers with tanks and displaying its firepower to mark the 22nd anniversary of Britain's handover of Hong Kong to China.Monday's protest was also planned to coincide with that anniversary. Although the proposed law allowing extraditions to the mainland has now been effectively shelved, the protest movement has grown into one expressing a host of deep, pent-up grievances - most fundamentally that the Hong Kong government is not directly elected or genuinely representative. 
But the demonstrations turned violent Monday night. 
A relatively small group of front-line protesters smashed their way into the Hong Kong legislature, removing the Chinese flag from a flagpole and replacing it with a black one featuring a withering bauhinia, the flower on Hong Kong's emblem. Inside the legislative building, protesters spray-painted over references to the ""People's Republic of China.""
In another particularly cutting gesture, they also draped Hong Kong's British colonial flag in the chamber, 22 years after it stopped flying here. 
""It is going to get Beijing very, very concerned,"" said Steve Tsang, the director of SOAS University of London's China Institute. ""It will start a process in Beijing for them to start to think, what will they do if the Hong Kong government cannot handle [these protests]?"" 
Beijing reacted angrily Tuesday.
""These serious illegal actions have trampled on Hong Kong's rule of law, undermined Hong Kong's social order and damaged its fundamental interests, and are a flagrant challenge to the bottom line of 'one country, two systems,' "" the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, part of the state council, or cabinet office, of the Chinese government, said in a statement.Hong Kong was promised a high degree of autonomy when it was handed back to China in 1997, including its own political system, legislature, immigration system and economic framework. 
But Beijing's influence is increasingly being felt in the territory through the way it selects the chief executive, who has stifled freedom of the press and jailed people who oppose the system.
""The central government firmly supports the [Hong Kong] government and police performing their duties lawfully, and supports the relevant departments to hand down punishment against violent criminals, in accordance with the law,"" the Chinese statement said.
State-affiliated media noted that Western countries have used stern measures to stamp out protests, mentioning that Britain acted strongly to quell riots in London in 2011.
Together, the statements formed ""kind of an instruction"" for Lam ""to be harsh,"" said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University. 
The unprecedented intensity of Monday's protests will also give Beijing ""a reason for being much more hands-on and more repressive"" when it comes to Hong Kong, Cabestan added.

For Xi, this is not just about Hong Kong. He will also be concerned, analysts said, that the protests and the reaction may strengthen the resolve of Taiwan to assert its independence from the mainland. 
Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, who is hawkish toward China, is the front-runner in elections to be held in Taiwan next year and could get an additional boost from the protests in Hong Kong because they illustrate the potential costs to the self-ruled island of closer relations with Beijing.
The question now is how Beijing proceeds. 
After a 79-day occupation of Hong Kong's streets in 2014, which was then the strongest rebuke of China's growing political influence, the authorities followed a familiar playbook: arresting and jailing protest leaders in drawn-out proceedings. Young activists who rose to fame through the protests, known as the Umbrella Movement, were disqualified when they ran for and won legislative seats. 
The idea, analysts say, was to create a chilling effect, quash Hong Kong's civil society and discourage protesters from doing it again - a strategy that largely worked for five years, until recent weeks. 
""They expected that Hong Kong civil society would be paralyzed,"" said Ho-Fung Hung, an expert in Chinese political economy and Hong Kong politics at Johns Hopkins University. ""They have been very surprised"" by the latest demonstrations, he said. 
Cabestan said Beijing would want a two-pronged approach. ""Beijing on the one hand will try to convince the Hong Kong authorities to try to give more benefits to the underprivileged,"" he said. ""On the other hand, Beijing will impose a shorter leash on Hong Kong.""The Hong Kong government, however, remains in a bind. The city's housing market is the world's most expensive, and any solution would not be immediate. 
Meanwhile, mass arrests stemming from Monday's protests, like Beijing wants, would risk provoking mainstream anger yet again. About 2 million people showed up at a march last month, shocked at a police crackdown on young protesters who surrounded the legislative buildings a few days before.
And then there's the fundamental question of the legitimacy of Hong Kong's government and a demand for universal suffrage - a concession that is virtually unthinkable from Beijing. 
""I feel that in the longer run, any kind of unrest in society cannot be resolved without considering some kind of political structure reform, especially for the young people,"" said Michael Tien, a pro-Beijing lawmaker. There is a ""fundamental frustration,"" he added, that Hong Kong's legislature ""is not safeguarding their interests.""

China thinks it can stop Hong Kong's protesters. It can't.,"Journalist
says using force won't end the crisis
protracted conflicts typically end in one of two ways: Either the party with overwhelming force subjugates the other and declares a complete victory, or the two sides get tired of fighting and make a deal.
In Hong Kong "" now in its sixth month of an increasingly violent, seemingly intractable conflict "" China's communist rulers and their handpicked chief executive, Carrie Lam, seem intent on achieving a total victory over a leaderless, loosely organized, youth-driven protest movement that has paralyzed the city and plunged the economy into recession. The protesters 'will never win,' Lam has vowed, and it's 'wishful thinking' to believe that the government will ever yield. And there's no doubt China has the overwhelming power in this dispute, as well as the will to dominate.
But Beijing is not going to get its way.
Already, it has tried. Hong Kong police have fired more than 8,000 rounds of tear gas, thousands of rubber bullets and hundreds of beanbag rounds, and have made more than 4,000 arrests. Three people have been shot with bullets. The authorities have used a new law to ban wearing masks in public and a colonial-era statute to charge protesters with the crime of 'rioting,' which can carry a 10-year prison term.-A curfew appears to be under consideration. Universities (including the University of Hong Kong, where I teach) have suspended classes for the remainder of this year. Police in full riot gear have raided university campuses, commercial buildings, even churches.
None of it has worked. Black-clad, ninja-like protesters roam the streets undeterred, and the protests enjoy broad public support, including among white-collar professionals. Brutal police tactics have elicited only heightened violence from the protesters: What started as brick throwing toward police has descended into gasoline bomb attacks, arson, vandalism and gruesome assaults, including protesters setting a man on fire. A 70-year-old man died after being hit in the head by a flying brick. Force has been met with force in an escalating cycle of violence.
It hasn't worked because the protest is popular and the protesters are committed. No new draconian laws, no new tactics, no increase in tear gas and live rounds, no heightened arrests will push or frighten Hong Kong's determined protesters off the streets. Short of an outright slaughter "" which, in an era of smartphones and surveillance cameras, seems not to interest Beijing "" force is not enough. China may not want to admit it, but the only solution to this crisis is a political one. Communist Party leaders will have to do something that to them is an anathema: They will have to make concessions.
The broad contours of a common-sense way to end the crisis are quite clear. Like the Arab-Israeli two-state solution, or a power-sharing agreement in Afghanistan between the U.S.-backed Kabul government and the Taliban, everyone knows what the final outcome will need to look like. The warring parties are merely battling over the steps to get there.
In Hong Kong, based on the declared goals of the protest movement, any resolution has to begin with the ouster of Lam as chief executive.-Her ill-conceived, widely despised idea to allow people arrested in Hong Kong (which has a respected legal system) to be extradited to face trial in mainland China (where torture and forced confessions are common, and where prosecutors enjoy a 99-percent conviction rate) triggered the current crisis.-She clung stubbornly to this bill even after 1-million Hongkongers, or 1 out of every 8 people here, marched peacefully in protest.-She is by far the least popular chief executive since the territory reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
Lam's cabinet will have to go, too. They allowed her to push the extradition bill despite widespread opposition because they are radically out of touch with average Hongkongers. They are so tied to the elite, and to Beijing, that they either ignored or underestimated the widespread anger on the streets.
Hong Kong's underlying problem "" and the root of this crisis "" is the absence of politics.-Where else could a leader see a quarter of the population marching in the streets and still forge ahead?-It's because here, the top official is not accountable to the people but is handpicked by a Communist Party dictatorship in a capital 1,200 miles away. She answers to Beijing, not to constituents.
For that reason, reform will need to include an expansion of the democratic franchise to allow all the seats in the local legislature (instead of half, as they are now) to be elected by popular vote, and universal suffrage for the election of the city's chief executive.-The Communist Party in Beijing will always reserve the right to vet the candidates.-But people in Hong Kong deserve a say.-And given the past sorry chiefs picked by Beijing "" two who didn't complete a second term, one jailed for corruption and now Lam "" allowing the people to decide is a certain improvement.
Protesters will also insist on some form of accountability for what happened: an independent commission to investigate unlawful police behavior since the start of the protests. Officers, operating with Beijing's backing, have indiscriminately lobbed thousands of canisters of tear gas at largely peaceful demonstrators, have used pepper spray, beanbags and rubber bullets at close range, and have been recorded abusing subdued and handcuffed protesters.
Journalists trying to cover the demonstrations have also been targeted, seemingly with impunity. Police now use flashing strobe lights affixed to their helmets to prevent the filming of arrests on public streets. Several reporters have been pepper-sprayed and tear-gassed despite wearing yellow vests and helmets marked 'PRESS.' Some have been severely injured, including a reporter from Indonesia who was shot in the face with a police projectile and blinded in one eye. Lam says the existing police watchdog body can probe any accusations of excessive force, but officials who know its workings say its resources are inadequate for the job. 
Finally, protesters want amnesty for those arrested during the demonstrations, and they want rioting charges dropped. Those demands could be answered by a commission tasked broadly to look into violence on all sides, and by holding for trial only those who injured others. A model might be the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, set up after apartheid, which granted amnesty to those who voluntarily came forward and testified truthfully.
At the moment, Beijing's leaders and their representatives in Hong Kong have stood firmly behind the police and urged even tougher action to quell the protests "" while never specifically rejecting the call for an independent commission. The Financial Times recently reported that Beijing has already decided to remove Lam sometime next year. Lam herself was recorded saying she would have quit at the start of the unrest 'if I [had] a choice,' but she later denied she intended to resign. 
So far, the conflict here has looked like the collision of an unstoppable force and an immovable object. Neither side wants to give up. For the protesters, it would mean surrendering their cherished freedoms and becoming completely subjugated to Beijing, becoming just another mainland Chinese city; for Beijing, it would mean showing signs of weakness, bowing to demands from the street and potentially triggering what the authoritarian leaders fear most "" the protest contagion spilling over the border to neighboring Guangzhou and elsewhere in China. 
But the costs of persisting "" terrible pictures of violence beamed across the world, mass arrests, the long-term alienation of a population whose submission China needs "" will, sooner or later, prove too high. Beijing's going to have to make a deal.

Hong Kong on edge after riots follow face mask ban,"HONG KONG - This major financial hub and usually vibrant city of 7 million was reduced to confusion and quiet Saturday morning, as Hong Kong woke to find its entire subway system shut down, buses disrupted, and supermarkets and malls shuttered in anticipation of more protests. 
The semiautonomous Chinese territory is on edge after Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced she would invoke rarely used emergency powers to ban masks at protests, a decision that immediately intensified anger and unrest on city streets. On Friday night, a peaceful march through the city spiraled into pockets of riots as protesters torched subway stations and businesses that were linked to pro-Beijing tycoons.
Glass shards remained scattered across pavements the next day from shops that had been vandalized, with their windows smashed. MTR Corp., which operates the city's rail network, said it had to shut the entire network after ""the outbreak of violence at multiple districts"" to ensure the safety of its staff. The unprecedented move was in effect for all of Saturday. 
Even always-reliable 7-Eleven convenience stores would be closed at 5 p.m., the chain announced on its Facebook page.
""This is the really one very sad day for Hong Kong,"" said Dennis Kwok, a pro-democracy lawmaker who represents the legal sector.
Kwok filed an urgent legal challenge to the mask law along with 23 other pro-democracy lawmakers on Saturday, seeking a judicial review of the law as well as a temporary injunction. A hearing is set for Sunday morning.
""The reason why the people were out there protesting against the extradition bill is because they feared that their freedoms will be taken away,"" he said. ""Now, [the government has] demonstrated that the fears are justified.""
Among the nearly three dozen people hospitalized in the protests Friday night was a 14-year-old boy, shot in the left thigh by an undercover police officer. After he fired at the boy, a group threw a petrol bomb at the officer, briefly setting him on fire. 
The police force characterized the shooting as justified, as did Lam, who addressed the city in a five-minute pretaped video released on Saturday afternoon. As she spoke in the recorded tape, speaking of ""unprecedented"" levels of vandalism and destruction on Friday night, she was flanked by more than a dozen of her ministers.
""Fellow citizens, the extreme acts of the rioters brought dark hours to Hong Kong last night and half paralyzed society today,"" Lam said. ""Everyone is worried, anxious and even in fear. The [Hong Kong government] will curb the violence with the greatest determination.""


Protesters on Saturday morning debated on Web forums and secure messaging apps the merits of ""taking a rest"" amid the city shutdown, but others did not want to deliver the government a victory after the new government restriction. By 3 p.m., a few hundred people had begun marching peacefully from the shopping district of Causeway Bay. Later in the day, others linked hands in a vigil in the Tsim Sha Tsui area along Victoria Harbor and marched through Kowloon neighborhoods. 
Most of the protesters were still wearing surgical masks to cover their faces. 
The effect of stronger police enforcement could already be felt. In central Hong Kong, riot police tackled a young man and his girlfriend, both of whom were wearing masks, in front of the iconic HSBC headquarters building in central Hong Kong. Several officers in full riot gear, backed by about 40 of their colleagues nearby, pinned them to a divider at a tram stop while they searched through their bags. Passersby heckled the officers and told them to leave.The man and his girlfriend were not arrested. The man, speaking to The Washington Post after officers had left, said he didn't understand what he had done wrong. His girlfriend was in tears. He spoke on the condition of anonymity
because of privacy issues.

The government's decision to implement the mask ban and the use of emergency powers to do so came at a time of already heightened emotions in the city, after an 18-year-old man was shot in the chest by police in one of several chaotic protests in the city on Tuesday. The emergency powers, which date back to Hong Kong's time under British colonial rule in 1922, were last used during leftist riots in 1967, which left more than 50 dead.
Critics have accused Hong Kong's government of once again being out of touch with the population, as lawmakers were when they proposed legislation that would allow extradition to mainland China - the spark of the protest movement back in June. Demands have now swelled to include direct elections for Hong Kong and - crucially - an independent investigation of a police force many fear is operating with impunity.

Hong Kong protests: 4 key questions,"Protesters effectively shut down Hong Kong's airport on Monday with a sit-in that forced officials to take the extraordinary step of canceling all flights.
The fresh action has catapulted Hong Kong's months-long protest movement into new territory amid growing concern that China will take a more active - and potentially violent - stand to quell the unrest. Here are some key questions, answered.
Why did the protests start?
Protests kicked off in June over concerns that Hong Kong was set to pass a bill that would allow individuals to be extradited to China. Since the British handover in 1997, Hong Kong and China have been party to a ""one country, two systems"" agreement that offers residents of Hong Kong a greater degree of independence than they would have in the mainland.
Opponents of the bill said it jeopardized Hong Kong's semiautonomy and, if passed, would endanger Hong Kong-based critics of Beijing, who could find themselves facing the Chinese legal system, where human rights groups have documented arbitrary detention and torture.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam insisted the bill would not apply to issues of free speech. Protesters were unconvinced.
The movement now has five key demands for Hong Kong's government: to withdraw the extradition bill; to officially retract descriptions of the protests as a ""riot""; to drop charges against protesters; to launch an investigation into police force during the protests; and to enact ""universal suffrage,"" which would allow Hong Kong voters to directly pick their leaders rather than the current process, which includes Beijing's involvement.

How much have the protests escalated?

In early June, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets. Police responded with force, using tear gas and batons to disperse the crowds, which inspired more protests. In mid-June, 2 million people are believed to have joined what was probably the largest protest in Hong Kong's history.
In late July, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in the airport, warning travelers they were not safe in Hong Kong. Early this month, thousands of people took to the streets for yet another rally - the first in which civil servants joined as an organized bloc, shouting, ""Hong Kongers, fight on! Civil servants, fight on!""
On Aug. 5, a strike shut down much of the city, with major disruptions to public transit and airline operations.

How did Hong Kong's government respond?

In July, Lam partly backed down from the extradition bill, saying it ""is dead."" That terminology wasn't enough for protesters who accused her of using ""wordplay"" to trick them into thinking the bill was formally withdrawn.
In June, demonstrators called for Lam to step down. But she has stood her ground with backing from Beijing.
Lam went weeks without appearing in public, but last week, she reemerged, telling reporters that Hong Kong had to ""set aside differences and bring back order and say no to chaos and violence.""
She also said that protesters were trying to ""topple Hong Kong"" and that she had met with dozens of business leaders who expressed concerns that the protests could spark major economic turmoil.
""This downturn is coming very quickly,"" she told the media last Friday. ""Some people have described it as coming like a tsunami.""

How has China responded?

China has stood firmly behind Lam. And in late July, a military spokesman said that, if Hong Kong officials requested it, China would mobilize People's Liberation Army troops to restore order to the city. On Monday, that prospect began to appear more likely. The nationalist Global Times reported that the People's Armed Police, a Chinese paramilitary unit, is assembling armored personnel carriers near Shenzhen, a city bordering Hong Kong.
Last month, dozens of men carrying Chinese flags beat anti-government protesters in Hong Kong, leaving at least 45 people hospitalized. Experts cautioned there was no evidence Chinese officials ordered the attack.
On Monday, Yang Guang, the head of the Chinese Cabinet's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office, described the protests as ""terrorism"" for the first time.
""We should relentlessly crack down on such violent criminal acts without mercy,"" he said.

"Hong Kongers mark 2014 protest, face water cannons","On Umbrella Revolution anniversary, anti-Beijing movement reinvigorated
Anti-Beijing sentiment strong on anniversary of Umbrella Revolution 
HONG KONG - Hong Kong protesters on Saturday gathered in the tens of thousands to mark the fifth anniversary of the Umbrella Revolution that awakened the city's distinct identity in opposition to its masters in Beijing and laid the groundwork for a political crisis now in its 17th week. 
Protesters unfurled a ""We are back"" banner, referencing a promise made in 2014 when authorities cleared their 79-day sit-in, and took over the same road they occupied at the time. 
After a months-long and unprecedented protest movement that has ruptured trust between many Hong Kong residents and the city's institutions, protesters have a more urgent message: mass action on Oct. 1, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Police on Saturday once again moved to quickly clear protesters with tear gas and water cannons blasting a blue dye, an indication of officers' waning tolerance for demonstrations that have played out every weekend since June. 


The Umbrella Movement was triggered by a proposal from Beijing to grant Hong Kong only limited democracy by keeping the city from choosing its own leader. It turned into an occupation of city streets when police fired tear gas into a crowd. 
Five years later, protesters descended upon the same location, an area around government buildings in central Hong Kong. Armed with stacks of posters, stickers, fliers and cans of glue and spray paint, they rebuilt ""Lennon Walls"" of anti-government graffiti. Images that have shocked this city over the past weeks were on display: police pummeling black-clad protesters and spraying commuters in the eyes with pepper spray, injured demonstrators clutching their wounds. 
Almost every blank surface - walls, sidewalks and street signs - was covered with posters advertising demonstrations on the Chinese anniversary. Protesters see the anniversary as a climax for their movement, which, both in 2014 and today, centers on the fears that China under leader Xi Jinping will erase the city's cherished freedoms and autonomy.

""From one generation, to another, to another, Hong Kongers will go on to fight for the same goal, which is genuine democracy in Hong Kong,"" said Benny Tai, an academic who was jailed over his role in the 2014 movement.
Kai Lo, an 18-year old gluing down signs in a city park, added: ""Without the experience five years ago, we could not develop such a belief"" on the importance of our freedoms. 
In a statement Saturday night, a spokesman for the Hong Kong government said universal suffrage is ""enshrined as an ultimate aim"" of the city's basic law.
The Hong Kong government ""will assess the situation carefully and take forward constitutional development[s]"" with Beijing's input and according to the law, the statement said.
Protesters assembled the Lennon Wall of posters and graffiti to stretch from Victoria Park to Tamar Park, both significant landmarks for recent protests with historic turnouts. The rally Saturday evening was organized by the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), the group that planned the first march against a now-scrapped bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. 
As the protest movement has grown in scope and focus, the CHRF has facilitated several huge demonstrations denouncing police brutality and calling for universal suffrage for the semiautonomous territory. 
Just 15 minutes after Saturday's rally began, protesters began to occupy Harcourt Road, the major thoroughfare they took over during the Umbrella Revolution and occupied several times more over the past months of protest.Protesters including children and the elderly had to walk over grinning portraits of Chinese President Xi when arriving at the rally. Some took extra effort to stomp over the taped-down pictures and scrape their shoes over his face. Speakers blasted a rotation of protest songs that have provided an ever-evolving soundtrack of resistance. Attendees sang along to ""Glory to Hong Kong,"" a recently written unofficial national anthem, and a version of Sia's ""Chandelier,"" the lyrics reworked to admonish the police. 
While police fired just 87 canisters of tear gas in 2014, more than 3,000 rounds, along with hundreds of rubber bullets and sponge grenades, have been used against the demonstrators over the past four months. 
The use of the noxious gas has become so prevalent that protesters have become adept at quickly extinguishing the spewing canisters - covering them with pot lids or dousing them with water. Police have also deployed specialized trucks that blast demonstrators with high-pressure hoses, the water mixed with chemical irritant and blue dye. 
One of protesters' key demands is for Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam to open a fully independent investigation into the police, but she has resisted, arguing that an existing mechanism is sufficient for the task. More people in Hong Kong are increasingly seeing the police as an illegitimate occupying force carrying out Beijing's repression. 
Protests in recent months have reinvigorated Hong Kong's civil society, which was crushed and lost at the end of the Umbrella Movement. Jack Hui, a 27-year-old administrator at a financial institution, said he felt ""hopeless"" at the end of the 79-day sit-in because it seemed impossible to keep ""pushing forward the democratic revolution."" 
""I couldn't imagine our movement now would last for so long, for more than three months,"" he said. ""We're just seeing the beginning of the emergence of the movement."" 
Hong Kong protesters have increasingly appealed to the United States for help in their fight for democracy, hoping to leverage geopolitical tensions and an ongoing trade war between China and the United States. This month, Hong Kong activists and academics spoke at a congressional hearing urging the passage of a bill that would seek to impose sanctions on those who curtail the territory's freedoms.
One of the hearing's witnesses, American citizen Dan Garrett, an academic and former U.S. government worker, was denied entry into Hong Kong. He said this was the first time his passport was flagged in 20 years of visiting the city and that he was not given a clear reason by immigration authorities.
A spokesman for Hong Kong's Immigration Department said it does not comment on individual causes and will have to ""regard to the circumstances pertaining to each individual case"" to decide whether to allow someone entry into the city.

Hong Kong leader asks protesters to talk,"Plea for dialogue comes amid more clashes, disruptions
HONG KONG - Embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Saturday appealed in a Facebook post for dialogue between her government and protesters, as demonstrators again took to the streets and clashed violently with police despite the deliberate closure of subway stops in the vicinity of their planned protest.

""After more than two months of escalated protests, we are all tired. Can we just sit down and talk about it?"" Lam said in her post Saturday afternoon. She added that ""prolonged fighting is not the way out"" of Hong Kong's crisis and appealed to protesters to take seriously her proposal to launch a platform for dialogue in the city. 
Meanwhile, an approved rally in the eastern Kowloon area of Hong Kong again descended into a tense standoff between riot police and protesters. Hong Kong's MTR Corp., which runs the city's subway, had suspended service between several stops and closed subway stations in the Kwun Tong area where the protest was planned, leading to heated arguments between residents and staff at the stations. 
By Saturday afternoon, protesters had dug in for another engagement with police and started to dismantle ""smart lampposts"" that have recently been installed in the city - a sign of growing concerns about technology that Hong Kong and Chinese authorities could potentially use for surveillance. The Hong Kong government, when introducing the lampposts, said they would be used to collect data on traffic, weather and air quality and would not be used for facial recognition or to collect personal information.
""Some violent protesters maliciously damaged lampposts on Sheung Yuet Road, Kwun Tong and vandalized Government properties, neglecting other road users' safety,"" the Hong Kong police said in a statement, adding that they deployed tear gas and ""minimum force"" to clear demonstrators tossing gasoline bombs and bricks. 
The scenes marked a return of the kind of chaos that has gripped the city for a dozen weekends now, after large peaceful demonstrations over the previous weekend and again on Friday. 
Beijing has been clear about its growing intolerance of the protests, and pressure is now extending to Hong Kong's multinational corporations and its diplomatic corps. 
On Saturday, Chinese police said they had released an employee of the British Consulate in Hong Kong who was detained in China as he was trying to make his way back from Shenzhen, the Chinese city that borders Hong Kong. 
Simon Cheng, a 28-year-old trade and investment officer at the consulate, was detained for violating mainland Chinese law and had ""confessed to his illegal acts,"" the public security bureau in Luohu, Shenzhen said on its Weibo account, without providing further details.
In a statement, his family confirmed that Cheng had returned to Hong Kong and said he had ""no external injury.""

Hong Kong's biggest march in weeks remains peaceful,"Protesters defy Beijing, police and storm as movement regains steam
HONG KONG - Hundreds of thousands of protesters, facing an intensifying police crackdown and threats of military force from Beijing, responded Sunday with a huge and peaceful march, underscoring continued mass support for the pro-autonomy movement here.
Although authorities did not grant permission for a march and a torrential downpour soaked demonstrators, the spontaneous procession made its way haphazardly across the city, participants defiantly chanting calls for freedom and repudiating alleged police brutality.
Organizers estimated the turnout at more than 1.7 million - among the largest demonstrations seen here in weeks. It was marked by restraint from protesters, who urged one another to avoid confrontations with police.
Police said 128,000 filled Victoria Park at its busiest point but did not release estimates of the number who marched or demonstrators in the surrounding areas.
After two months of sustained dissent, the movement is entering a pivotal moment: Hong Kong police have deployed unprecedented force, including in residential neighborhoods, and made more than 700 arrests to discourage further unrest. Protesters and pro-establishment groups have clashed violently. And Beijing has ramped up pressure to bring international corporations to heel.
But as the stakes rise sharply, activists exhorted Hong Kongers on Sunday to ""no longer stay silent."" 
""Over the last two months in Hong Kong, we've shed blood, sweat, and tears,"" the Civil Human Rights Front, the organizer of the rally, said in an open letter. ""Hong Kongers have endured enough humiliation by the Hong Kong Government and the Hong Kong Police.""
Civil Human Rights Front leaders, who organized marches in June that drew millions, feared that attendance this time would be affected by bad weather and an airport fracas last week that marred the movement's image. Police rejected their demands for a march from Victoria Park to central Hong Kong and urged the rally to stay put inside the park.

But the organizers' concerns about turnout appeared to be unfounded, as Victoria Park quickly overflowed with people despite pouring rain and gusting winds. So many emerged for the rally that major thoroughfares near Victoria Park were jammed.

The large turnout, which forced the closure of roads and diverted traffic, was the latest indicator of the pro-autonomy movement's unflagging momentum, even after the ugly scenes Tuesday at Hong Kong's airport, where frenzied mobs blocked passengers from boarding planes and effectively took two Chinese men hostage for a short time. The attendance also underscored protester resilience in the face of the escalating crackdown by authorities and rhetoric from Beijing, which has sought to brand them as terrorists.
China's People's Armed Police, a paramilitary force, practiced crowd control tactics in Shenzhen, the Chinese city connected to Hong Kong, over the past week.
""They are doing it to scare us,"" said Jeff, a 36-year-old manager at a logistics firm who took a break from the rain-soaked march. He pushed back against China's depiction of the protesters as radicals.
""Hong Kong is part of China, but Hong Kong people deserve to have our rights and our benefits,"" said Jeff, who gave only his first name for fear of reprisal from authorities.
""We want to fight for freedom, fight about the extradition, fight about police, about housing, about our rights."" Previous rallies have been tarnished by violence, and the prospect loomed over the event on Sunday. Opposition figures hoped the rally would help restore the movement's international image after protesters at the airport were branded as extremists earlier in the week.
When protesters used laser pointers to provoke police guarding government buildings, others scolded them and called for restraint. Wong Yik-Mo, one of the leaders of the Civil Human Rights Front, said he believed most protesters wanted a peaceful demonstration. 
""There's a consensus everyone will be restrained,"" he said. ""It'll be in the police's hands whether to provoke us, whether to fire tear gas.""
The police presence remained light through the afternoon, and there was no attempt to block the route of the march. But a front-line police officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters, said water cannons - a new crowd-dispersal tool police have in their arsenal - were on standby. 
Protesters are, above all, demanding an independent investigation into the police and their use of force to quell the demonstrations, including mass arrests, tear gas fired in almost all of Hong Kong's districts and the use of projectiles including bean bag rounds. 
Some carried signs showing a one-eyed young woman, a reference to a medical worker who was hit in the eye by a projectile last week during clashes between police and protesters. Police say they cannot confirm how the woman was injured.
A spokesman for the Hong Kong government ""expressed regret"" at the protest's focus on the police.
""Many police stations were attacked or besieged for over 75 times [during the protests]. The Police have been handling these illegal acts with tolerance,"" the spokesman said in a statement.
""Only when they were violently attacked and left with no choice did the Police use minimum force to disperse protesters in order to restore social order.""
The government ""appealed to those participating in public meetings and processions to express their views in a peaceful and rational manner and say 'no' to violence so that Hong Kong can resume order as soon as possible, return to rationality and regain momentum.""
Helen Ho, a housewife from the outlying Sha Tin neighborhood, prepared to enter Victoria Park on Sunday with her 2-year-old son strapped to her chest. Her husband, Samuel, a teacher, cradled their 1-year-old daughter.
Ho said she was tired of watching police officials hold daily news conferences saying they use limited force even as they launch tear gas and fire projectiles into crowds of civilians.
""At this point, it is very clear they can do anything they want then say anything. It doesn't make sense,"" Ho said as she put a pacifier in her son's mouth. 
She worried that violence would erupt again. She would take her children home soon.
""We need to show our voice about police brutality and fight for their future,"" Ho said. Chants of ""Fight for freedom! Stand with Hong Kong!"" rang through the park.
Even as night fell, masked protesters who usually arm themselves with bricks, shields and other makeshift weapons to square off with police remained restrained, urged by others nearby not to fall into ""police traps."" Protesters encouraged one another not to gather around Beijing's liaison office in the city, a target of earlier demonstrations that was heavily guarded Sunday by riot police, to keep the evening peaceful. 
Paranoia has been high in the movement after undercover police dressed as protesters in masks and black outfits made arrests last weekend.
Demonstrations were also held on Saturday, one of them organized by teachers who said they feared for their young students who have been at the forefront of the protests. 
Marches were held in cities around the world, including New York, Boston, London, Toronto, Sydney and Melbourne, to express solidarity for the Hong Kong movement.

"China's firewall between mainland, Hong Kong","Beijing moves to prevent any spillover from pro-democracy protests 
HONG KONG - When Bella, a mainland Chinese student, returned home after a week-long program in Hong Kong, it didn't occur to her to take any special precautions. She hadn't ventured near the protests that have rocked the city.
Approaching the mainland border point last month, the 21-year-old was pulled aside along with several others. Officers combed her phone, discovering Facebook and its Messenger app, both banned in China. She said her entry permit - a card used by mainland Chinese to travel to and from Hong Kong - was briefly confiscated while officers questioned her and accused her of deleting messages to hide unspecified evidence. 
""I was shocked that they would do that without reason,"" said Bella, who gave only her first name for fear of reprisal, explaining that she had downloaded Facebook to follow fan pages of her musical idol, David Bowie. ""I kept trying to explain, but the officers wouldn't believe me."" 
As protests in Hong Kong have intensified into a rebellion against the Chinese state and its increasing grip over the former British colony, Beijing has grown anxious about any kind of spillover to the mainland.
Chinese officials are trying to solidify an ideological iron curtain between Hong Kong and mainland China - tracking people who go back and forth, ratcheting up propaganda, and intimidating protest sympathizers - to ring-fence the mainland from protesters' pro-autonomy viewpoints.
This campaign is playing out at border crossings, in cyberspace and on college campuses as far afield as Australia and the United States. 
The Washington Post spoke to almost a dozen Chinese students and young professionals who have been stopped and searched at the border. Others on the mainland say they have been pressured by Chinese authorities to delete social media accounts and threatened with arrest for expressing views deemed supportive of protesters.For President Xi Jinping, these efforts reflect the dilemma of how to ideologically insulate his country even as the Chinese are increasingly immersed in the world, including 520,000 students flowing yearly out of its borders. 
This conundrum is especially acute when it comes to Hong Kong, which Beijing has been trying to integrate socially and economically since the territory's 1997 return to Chinese sovereignty, while keeping the financial hub's relative freedoms from seeping into the mainland.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States reminded Chinese students in an open letter this week to be ""representatives for this generation of Chinese youth"" at American campuses and ""demonstrate young Chinese peoples' feelings and responsibilities through openness and confidence.""
When Chinese students in Hong Kong returned to the city after summer break, a text message sent to their phones from Chinese provincial authorities urged them to ""unwaveringly uphold a position of loving the country and loving Hong Kong"" and ""by no means"" attend any protests. 
Chinese authorities usually block social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter by using a censorship apparatus nicknamed the Great Firewall. Yet they allowed hundreds of nationalist youths to use special software last week to vault over the firewall and flood international social networks with pro-Beijing messages.
State media has at times stayed silent on major developments in Hong Kong, including the news Wednesday that Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam had withdrawn the contentious extradition bill that sparked the crisis.
At other times, Chinese authorities have splashed stories about the Chinese flag being hurled into the sea and promoted viral hashtags on Weibo - the country's version of Twitter - with pro-Beijing messages such as: ""The five-star red flag has 1.4 billion guardians. I'm one of them!"" 
The information gap has sometimes generated confusion on Chinese social media. Some users were puzzled about why Hong Kong's stock market suddenly shot up Wednesday afternoon, when breaking news about the extradition bill's withdrawal was suppressed on the mainland. Other Chinese who had seen weeks of coverage about violent protests wondered why the government would cave to a radical fringe.'Harmful trend'
Some Chinese citizens have tried to offer a different perspective, using virtual private network (VPN) software to access Facebook and Twitter and to read international news reports on the protests.
Byron Chen, a 34-year-old teacher at an international school, attended a July 14 rally organized by the Hong Kong Journalists Association, which advocates unfettered media access to the protests. He posted a picture on his WeChat page, stressing the legal and peaceful nature of the gathering.
One of his contacts saved the photo and distributed it with the teacher's personal details. It was soon picked up by Chinese nationalists with huge followings on Weibo. Soon, he was flooded with online messages calling for his death or imprisonment. Plainclothes officers paid him a visit, he said, and have barred him from going to Hong Kong without prior approval. 
""I feel sympathy for the protesters, but above all, I'm concerned of the rising totalitarianism and centralization of state power I see in China, which is a really harmful trend,"" he said in an interview. 
Chen said he has been forced to ""think twice"" before expressing his views, especially on Chinese social media apps. Getting outed online for liberal views, he added, is ""nearly a death penalty"" in China. 
Andreas Fulda, the author of a book on efforts at democratization in China and a senior fellow at the University of Nottingham's Asia Research Institute, said voices like Chen's are ""not being heard."" 
""But we shouldn't think that these voices do not exist,"" he added. 
Public figures in China who have urged their countrymen to have an open mind about the Hong Kong crisis also have been silenced. Last month, Chen Qiushi, a Beijing lawyer known for his online commentaries on social issues, told his more than 700,000 Weibo followers that he was skeptical about reports of widespread ""rioting"" and traveled to Hong Kong to get a look on the ground.
""We can't simply divide people into good or bad. People are complicated. People engage in all kinds of thinking,"" Chen told his audience in a live stream from Hong Kong's streets as marchers walked past in August. ""Not all of them are rioters.""
That crossed the line. Days later, Chen's videos were removed. His family and colleagues, under pressure from authorities, urged him to quickly return to Beijing. He hasn't been able to talk publicly since, said Xu Xiaodong, a friend of Chen's who is also an outspoken social media personality.
Xu, a mixed martial arts fighter by trade, said his social media accounts also were shut last month after he, like Chen, asked his followers how 2 million Hong Kongers could possibly all be labeled rioters. Days later, in late August, he was visited by authorities who asked whether he was funded by anti-Chinese foreign groups and pressured him to stop talking online.
""I told them I'll stop talking, but I'll continue to use VPN to get outside information for myself,"" Xu said in his basement gym in east Beijing. ""As a citizen of the People's Republic of China, I have a right to know about a huge incident like Hong Kong. You can't just hear one voice. When you hear only one voice, how do you know if it's real or fake?""'Blanket repression'
Snuffing out dissenting voices is a classic whack-a-mole strategy for a Beijing government concerned about the spread of destabilizing ideas across its southern border, said Jessica Chen Weiss, an expert on Chinese government and nationalism at Cornell University.
But Weiss noted an increasingly visible facet of the government's strategy: doubling down on propaganda and patriotic education to ""preempt"" critical views of the Communist Party.
""They want to create a frame of thought, to urge people to rally behind the government,"" she said. ""The Xi government is resorting to indoctrination and blanket repression.""Protests in Hong Kong show no signs of quieting down despite the government concession, and schools have become some of the epicenters. On Monday, the first day of the school year, Hong Kong high school students sang protest songs over the national anthem and boycotted class.

Meanwhile, in mainland China, millions of youths were shown a 90-minute back-to-school special on state television.
In online forums, Chinese parents lamented that their children were assigned homework about the program, which drilled into themes of patriotism, sacrifice and the sanctity of China's flag.The program conspicuously avoided any mention of Hong Kong, but it drove home its point with a final segment about Macao, a former Portuguese colony and semiautonomous territory that is often compared to Hong Kong.
A schoolgirl from Macao sang a ballad about her people's unbreakable loyalty to China despite its colonial past:
""You know 'Macao' was not my real family.
""I've been away from you, mother.
""What they plundered was my flesh.
""You still keep my soul.""

Shih reported from Beijing."
‘We need to arm ourselves’,"HONG KONG "" The six friends, then in their early 20s, met on an online messaging board where they traded advice on stocks and investing. Their bond grew as they pursued careers and dreams, securing white-collar jobs, girlfriends and wives.-
A decade on, they now swap notes on the most effective concoctions for molotov cocktails. Rather than scouring Hong Kong for the best bubble tea and hot pot, they compare brands of respirators and helmets.
The group's members "" accountants and a legal aide among them "" consider themselves foot soldiers in Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests, now into their sixth month, with tactics growing more violent among police and, in turn, among the demonstrators. Clashes took another menacing turn this week.
On Tuesday, fierce encounters between riot police and black-clad protesters gripped the Chinese University of Hong Kong as part of wider violence across the city. A day earlier, a protester was shot in the abdomen by police and critically injured, while a man was doused with flammable liquid and set on fire after a confrontation with pro-democracy protesters.
Amid the chaos, these six young men are being pulled along the same trajectory: increasingly supporting, and wielding, harsher methods of dissent.
'We have started to realize we need to arm ourselves. We are in a war "" there is no other choice,' said Kelvin, a 33-year-old accountant, who like the others in the group provided one name for fear of official retribution. 'We can't just be sitting ducks anymore.'-
This cohort's political evolution demonstrates the breadth of anger in Hong Kong. Where previous upwellings of public fury were often led by students, the authorities now face a scenario where regular office workers with stable jobs and promising careers have been loosed on a path to radicalization.

Violence has become commonplace at protests. Attacks on symbols of the state have expanded; businesses perceived as supporting the Chinese Communist Party have been-vandalized. Protesters have thrown gasoline bombs at police stations and assaulted officers. Police say they have discovered crude explosives, though no one has been hurt by these so far. 
Hundreds of thousands still demonstrate peacefully, despite the harder-line provocateurs in their midst. Residents shelter protesters fleeing from police operations. A recent survey by a polling center at the Chinese University of Hong Kong showed that almost half the respondents saw nothing wrong with protesters' actions. Only 1.6 percent found attacking the police unacceptable.
As Hong Kong's government, led by Chief Executive Carrie Lam, oversees an intensifying crackdown, experts say, more people will turn to violence to achieve their goals.-
Hong Kong's officials 'and their Beijing bosses have all condemned violent protests as if the moral high ground belongs to them,'-wrote Michael Chugani, a television host usually known for pro-government views.
'It doesn't,' he continued. 'The moral high ground belongs to the protesters. They were forced into using violence after Lam ignored their peaceful voice.'
A turning point
The six friends grew up understanding how large, peaceful rallies could effect change. Some of their families participated in huge marches in 2003 that forced the Hong Kong government to shelve plans to introduce sedition laws. In 2014, when thousands occupied the streets seeking direct elections in Hong Kong, the families were among the-'wo, lei, fei' "" the peaceful, rational and nonviolent protesters that formed the movement's core and who opposed radical actions.-
'In my heart, I knew the protests were useless in dealing with the Hong Kong government,' Samson, 32, said of the 2014 protests. He said it was becoming clear that the city's government responded only to Beijing, rather than the people of Hong Kong. 'But I continued my responsibility as a Hong Konger, and I continued to join in the protests.'-
After 79 days, the street occupation was cleared, failing in its goal.-The group of friends returned to their lives and careers.-
Then came the call on June 9 to protest a now-withdrawn government proposal to allow extraditions to mainland China. Organizers estimated that-over a million people turned out.-
When Samson returned home, he feared that it would be a repeat of 2014 "" another mass rally of marching and chanting that failed to achieve anything.
'I hoped that the next time, I could do more,' he said. 'Not just complete a march and that's it.'-
The next opportunity came June 12, when thousands of protesters took to the streets around the legislative complex to disrupt a debate on the extradition bill. Several of the friends took a half-day off, leaving their air-conditioned offices to deliver face masks and water to front-line protesters who built barricades to hold back riot officers.-
Police responded with then-rare force, including tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds.-
'It was our most angry day,' said Kelvin. 'For me, that was the turning point. Immediately, it was clear that the authorities would treat us differently than 2014, and so we had to respond differently.'-
It wasn't until July 21, when suspected members of organized-crime gangs-assaulted protesters at a subway station, that the friends started gearing up. Kelvin procured knee and arm pads, a half-face respirator and helmets.-
Ryan, a 28-year-old legal assistant, purchased respirators along with a hiking stick and helmets.-
'I thought, if that day comes again, to protect myself and my friends, I would use violence against [pro-Beijing gangsters],' he said. 'If I don't protect myself, I may get killed.'-
Samson added: 'I've thought about if I were one of the victims on July 21. If I didn't have any gear, I would've been hurt and unable to protect my friends.'-
Escalating action
At protests, the self-described nerds enlist the help of Steven, a 33-year-old construction worker. When masked front-line protesters dismantle metal barricades, dig out bricks and find other ways to hold back riot police, Steven is there with an array of tools, ready to provide expert help.-
He buys lighter fluid and electrical oil to douse floors of subway stations. The liquids serve a dual purpose: to vandalize the subway, whose-operator is seen as supporting Beijing, and to slow police who use the trains to get around on protest days, when the network is often closed to the public.-
Steven sometimes gets frustrated with his bookish crew, whom he affectionately calls the 'suit guys.'-
'I don't know if they just don't get it or they have short memories,' he said. 'But sometimes when I ask them to loosen a bolt or a screw, they'll drill it the opposite way and make it tighter instead. They've screwed up a lot.'-
Some in the team have developed their own niches. Kelvin, who is married, heads to the library to scour chemistry books for the best molotov cocktail recipes. When the first gasoline bombs were unleashed in July, he thought the flames were small and unimpressive. He wanted to make them more effective and share his knowledge with front-line protesters.
'Nowadays, you can see the huge flames and think, 'Whoa, how amazing,' ' he said, noting that 'it isn't an offensive tool to burn things, it is a barrier that allows our teammates to retreat.'-
'The aim is not violence for violence's sake, but to protect ourselves,' he said.-
Hong Kong government officials and their counterparts in Beijing have condemned "" in the harshest terms "" the hundreds of cases of arson, vandalism and sporadic mob violence. On Oct.-24, China's top diplomat in Hong Kong, Xie Feng, likened the violence at street protests to a 'virus.'
The virus 'knows no boundaries or limits. It is highly susceptible to being complicated by other viruses, such as populism, separatism and extremism, and developing into the tumor of terrorism,' Xie said.-
On Monday, Lam, the Hong Kong leader, said any 'wishful thinking' that violence would pressure her government into satisfying protester demands was misplaced. 'Our joint priority now as a city is to end the violence and to return Hong Kong to normal as soon as possible,' she said.
'Something exceptional is happening'
For a global financial center with a low crime rate, the path that Hong Kong is now on is highly unusual and bucks the conventional wisdom that violent protests dampen support for social movements, sociologists say.
'This is an extremely unusual case "" it seems like something exceptional is happening here,' said Robb Willer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University who found, in the context of white-nationalist rallies and anti-racist counterrallies, that violent protests tend to backfire.
He added that violent protests are likely to be more acceptable in settings where there is a 'high level of support' for the cause, and where the violence from the 'other side' is seen as worse.-
 The poll from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, conducted between Oct.-8 and Oct.-14, showed that almost 70 percent of respondents believe police have used excessive violence, compared with 40 percent who believe protesters are too violent.
'There is a much stronger concern about the police's excessive use of force,' said Benjamin Cheung, a lecturer in the department of psychology at the University of British Columbia who analyzed the survey and its methodology. 'In fact, there has been a small but significant shift in the direction of great public support for abandoning nonviolence as a tactic.'
The group of friends, and other more-radical front-line protesters, say the battles are just beginning. Protesters are adopting guerrilla-style tactics, they say, in which groups carry out destruction in their own neighborhoods and quickly return home, avoiding arrest. Some have begun conditioning for battle by practicing sprints at the gym,-taking up martial arts and improving their throwing accuracy.-
'If you think about the psychology of the protesters engaged in this violence, we are somewhere along a continuum on the path to extremism,' said Antony Dapiran, author of a book on Hong Kong protests. 'How far we go along that path, and how long it takes before we reach its horrifying ultimate destination, is the question.'-

Mob attacks Hong Kong protesters,"White-shirted men 
with bats, batons injure dozens at subway station

HONG KONG - Pro-democracy lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting was in a subway station near his constituency on Sunday night responding to reports of a violent mob in the area. Suddenly, dozens more of the white-shirted men appeared, surrounding the station.
Armed with bats, batons and wooden rods attached to Chinese flags, they chased protesters returning from a largely peaceful anti-government march into a subway train and around the station. As they kicked, hit and punched people, commuters pleaded for mercy and hid behind umbrellas. One witness said several women were wailing and hyperventilating in fear, some separated from their family members.
Video shared with The Washington Post showed the men beating people with sticks so violently that they fell to the ground, clutching injured limbs. Chinese flags that had fallen from the sticks littered the floor. Surgical face masks and tissues drenched in blood lay abandoned on subway cars.
""There were so many passengers, so many ordinary people,"" said Lam, speaking by telephone from a hospital where he was recovering from broken fingers, a deep gash near his mouth and other injuries to his arms and body. He could not remember how many had surrounded and pummeled him, but he said they were using vulgar language and telling people to stay away from the Yuen Long neighborhood.
The scenes marked an unprecedented level of violence against protesters during a political crisis that has gripped Hong Kong this summer. Those protests began in response to a now-suspended Hong Kong government proposal to allow extraditions to mainland China, but they have since swollen into a pro-autonomy movement calling for greater democracy and an inquiry into police violence, as well as the complete withdrawal of the extradition bill and the resignation of Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader.
In Washington, President Trump said Monday he believes that Chinese President Xi Jinping has reacted responsibly toward the Hong Kong protests.
The mob attacks on protesters late Sunday provoked widespread anger across Hong Kong. They also raised questions about the responsiveness of police, who arrived at the Yuen Long station only after the mob had left, more than an hour and a half after the first emergency calls. They made no immediate arrests. Police said Monday night they arrested two men involved in the Yuen Long attacks and charged them with illegal assembly.
Police Commissioner Stephen Lo said in a news conference Monday that his force had been busy responding to protests on Hong Kong island, about 20 miles away, and was short-staffed.
By early Monday, 45 men and women had been admitted to hospitals around Yuen Long in the New Territories area, close to the border with mainland China, some in critical condition. Among them was a pregnant woman who was knocked to the ground, a chef who suffered multiple gashes to his back, journalists and a member of the pro-democracy group Demosisto, according to local media reports, witnesses and the group.
The lawmakers and others attributed the attacks to organized-crime groups that operate in China and Hong Kong, known as triads. Lo did not dispute a reporter's characterization that the attacks were the work of triads but said there was no cooperation between police and the attackers.
Hong Kong was promised a high degree of autonomy when China reclaimed sovereignty over the British colony in 1997. But in recent years, concerns have grown that an increasingly powerful Beijing is asserting its influence in Hong Kong and gradually eroding the city's relative freedoms.
On Sunday evening, before the Yuen Long attacks, anti-government protesters defaced the Chinese government's liaison office in Hong Kong, spraying anti-China graffiti and pelting the building with eggs. They also splattered black ink over the Chinese national emblem.
Protesters and pro-democracy lawmakers expressed outrage that Hong Kong's government was quicker to condemn
the protesters - who did not injure anyone at the Chinese liaison office or other buildings - than the white-shirted attackers.
China's government expressed outrage at the vandalism of its liaison office, calling the protesters' actions ""intolerable.""

White House may not back bill in support of Hong Kong protesters,"After a week of intensified protests in Hong Kong, the U.S. Senate has moved to expedite the passage of a bill that would open a path to sanctions against those seen to be eroding freedoms in the Chinese territory. 
But this reconfiguration of U.S. policy toward Hong Kong would still need to pass another hurdle: the White House, where the pursuit of a trade deal with China could trump concerns over human rights in the semiautonomous territory. 
The bill, a version of which passed unanimously in the House, would mark the start of a dramatic shift in the relationship between the United States and Hong Kong. It mandates a yearly review of Hong Kong's special status with the United States, which allows it to be treated differently from mainland China and underpins its position as an international business hub. 
An influential bipartisan commission in a report, also released Thursday, separately advised Congress to assess whether Hong Kong continues to be largely autonomous from China, and to abolish its special status if Chinese military or police troops start moving into the territory. On Saturday, Chinese army troops stationed in Hong Kong helped to clean bricks and debris left behind by protesters at a university campus, the first time they have been seen out on the streets since the start of the unrest in June.

The question now is whether President Trump will act stridently in defense of Hong Kong. The president has not recently commented or tweeted on the situation there, even as protests intensified to dangerous new levels this past week, turning university campuses into battlegrounds and prompting daily demonstrations in the financial district. 
'His silence is noteworthy and very disturbing,' said Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) in an interview. 'We all want a good economic relationship with China. There's no question about that. But that shouldn't mean that we sacrifice our commitment to human rights.' 
Trump eyes a trade deal with Beijing as a leading priority as he makes his case for reelection in 2020. Though the president announced a tentative 'phase one' agreement last month, the two sides are still negotiating on key provisions. Plans for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign a pact at a regional economic summit in Chile over the weekend fell through when that gathering was canceled last month by the host government. 
Trump later said that a deal might not be achieved before the new year.
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) on Thursday began a process that would allow the Hong Kong bill to be passed by unanimous voice vote, rather than through a full debate, and he said it could pass as early as this week. 
The House unanimously passed a version of the Hong Kong bill last month, but until last week, it had stalled in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has probably been under White House pressure to delay the bill, according to a congressional aide, over concerns that pressure on Beijing over the Hong Kong issue could risk a trade deal with China. His office, in comments to The Washington Post, denied that he was delaying the bill over concerns from the White House. 
After protests in Hong Kong intensified this past week, prompted by the death of a student on Nov. 8 following a police operation, senators held a meeting on Wednesday to see whether potential issues could be resolved and the bill could be expedited. 
On Thursday, McConnell tweeted that the Senate 'needs to stand with Hong Kong' and said he hopes to 'take action soon.'
Trump has offered nominal support of the Hong Kong protesters, most prominently at the United Nations in September when he called on Beijing to 'honor its binding treaty' to protect the island's 'freedom, legal system and democratic ways of life.'
The president, however, has been careful not to inject human rights issues into the trade negotiations, and he has praised Xi's leadership while urging him to meet with the protesters to come to a resolution.
Trump has left the more strident language to Vice President Pence, who delivered a rebuke of Beijing in a lengthy speech on China policy at a Washington think tank last month. Pence warned that a trade deal would be more difficult if Chinese authorities 'resort to the use of violence' against the protesters. 
The White House declined a request to comment on the Senate bill, citing a policy of not discussing pending legislation.
Beijing condemned the passage of the bill in the House as backing 'radical forces' in Hong Kong, and Chinese state media branded the move 'arrogant and dangerous.' Analysts say 'predictable fury' from Beijing will continue if the bill becomes law, probably further complicating the trade negotiations, and could be used as evidence to support China's claims that Western forces are behind the protests. 
'If the bill passes, Beijing's outrage will also make it difficult for China to sign on to a trade agreement with the American 'black hands,' ' said Jude Blanchette, Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 
Yet, he added, 'it will be difficult for Trump to veto the bill, given the high degree of bipartisan support, as well as the aftereffects of the NBA contretemps, which raised awareness of events in Hong Kong across America.'
The National Basketball Association became ensnared in the situation last month after Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, posted a tweet in support of the protesters, causing a furor in China. Adam Silver, the commissioner of the professional basketball league, has said Beijing even asked for Morey to be fired.

The protests in Hong Kong rose to a new level of intensity this past week. Police on Monday spent hours bombarding students on the campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong with hundreds of canisters of tear gas and rubber bullets. Protesters lobbed petrol bombs and bricks at officers, who eventually retreated in what was some of the most intense fighting of the months-long movement. 
Students then barricaded the campus, and others in the city, setting about fortifying the universities from a possible police clearance. By Friday night, protesters had largely evacuated the Chinese University campus, leaving in droves as volunteer drivers arrived to ferry them to safety. 
The campuses were 'reflections of Hong Kong-wide disagreement,' the heads of nine universities said in an open letter, 'and the government must take the lead with swift and concrete action to resolve this political deadlock and to restore safety and public order now.' 
The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which recommended the assessment of Hong Kong's autonomy, acknowledged in its report that if Hong Kong no longer received special treatment, 'the loss of all of these benefits would materially alter not only the U.S.-Hong Kong relationship, but global sentiment and decision-making as well.'
Yet, it added, 'the future direction of Hong Kong "" and with it U.S.-Hong Kong policy "" will rest upon the outcome of the historic 2019 protest movement and the extent to which the Hong Kong government respects the aspirations of its people to protect the territory's autonomy.'

Police in riot gear react to protesters near the University of Hong Kong on Saturday. Rebellious students and anti-government protesters abandoned their occupation of nearly all of Hong Kong's universities Saturday after a near week-long siege by police.

Television Broadcasts Limited Hong Kong via AP
This image made from video shows People's Liberation Army soldiers, dressed in shorts and T-shirts, picking up bricks scattered by protesters at Hong Kong Baptist University. Troops from the Chinese army joined an effort Saturday to clean up debris outside the university, which was the site of clashes this week."
What protests in Russia and Hong Kong can teach us,"We live in an era of declining faith in elected leaders, declining faith in the institutions of the West, declining faith in democracy itself. In the United States, the world's most important democracy, Congress seems permanently deadlocked, in hock to moneyed interests, unable to grapple with the big issues of climate change, technological change, the information revolution. In Britain, one of the world's oldest democracies, politicians now speak in an offhand way about ""proroguing"" Parliament - asking the queen to suspend Britain's House of Commons - as a way of resolving the unresolvable problem of Brexit. 
Nor is the problem confined to the Anglo-Saxon world. A couple of years ago, two political scientists, Yascha Mounk and Roberto Stefan Foa, looked at the numbers in a now famous article and found that the number of people who believe that it is ""essential"" to live in a democracy has slipped in almost every Western country. The trend is especially pronounced among the young. Among Swedes born in the 1930s and 1940s, just to take one random example, more than 80 percent believe democracy is ""essential."" Among Swedes born in 1980, however, the figure has fallen to 60 percent. At the same time, several established democracies, from Hungary to India, have begun dismantling fundamental institutions and principles, including independent courts - a democratic deconsolidation that doesn't even arouse the interest of this U.S. administration.
It's a gloomy picture. It's also too simple. Even while the news at home gets constantly worse, we are simultaneously living in an era when the ideals of democracy have never burned more brightly, especially among younger people - at least those who live in autocracies. Here is a paradox: In two of the most authoritarian countries on the planet, unprecedented pro-democracy demonstrations are now unfolding, inspiring precisely the same generation that is bored by democracy in the West.
In Hong Kong, thousands of young people, most of whom no longer remember the years of British rule, are defying police brutality to make their voices heard. Having learned from the mistakes of the ""Occupy"" movement of 2014, they have created a whole new set of tactics to oppose a new law on extradition, learning to ""be water"" by constantly shifting the sites and styles of their protest, one day blocking major roads, another day rendering the airport dysfunctional. Constant, overwhelming propaganda from the Chinese authorities appears not to be working: Opinion polls show that the majority of Hong Kong people - including the vast majority of young people - don't sympathize with the regime and don't even feel ""Chinese,"" a shift in sensibility that helps to explain protesters' bravery. 
In Russia, where propaganda also attacks the West and derides democracy as chaotic and anarchic, protesters have focused very directly on the most fundamental of democratic institutions: They are demanding the right, simply, to vote for independent candidates in local elections. Just as in Hong Kong, Russian protests are being led by younger people, none of whom can remember any other leader except Vladimir Putin: ""I am 20 years old, and in my entire life there has not been a single day of freedom,"" one of them told reporters, according to Meduza, an independent website that covers Russia. They, too, are well organized, using up-to-the-minute apps to keep in touch with one other, deploying a phalanx of lawyers and a carefully planned social media campaign. Like the young Hong Kongers, young Russians aren't just dedicated; they are organized, thoughtful and well prepared. 
There are some obvious explanations for this East-West paradox. Clearly, the inhabitants of stable democracies find it hard to appreciate what they have: ""You don't know what you've got 'til it's gone"" isn't just a song lyric; it's an expression of something fundamental about the human brain. Like wealth, or health, political freedom may simply be something that people don't value if they've always had it. 
But it may also be that the young protesters of Russia and China are simply ahead of us. We've gotten used to the idea that political influence flows from West to East, but are we so sure that is still true? A generation of Eastern dissidents has thought harder than we have about how to self-organize, about how to operate in a world run by secretive, kleptocratic elites who go out of their way to create distraction and apathy. Remember that they, too, are fighting regimes that seem in hock to moneyed interests and wrestling to cope with the pace of technological change. It may be that we in the West simply haven't thought about what tactics ordinary people need to deploy to compete in a world where money is offshore, power is invisible and apathy is widespread. It may be that we need to learn from people who have.

China must choose wisely on Hong Kong,"Marco Rubio
, a Republican, is a U.S.
senator for Florida.

By choosing violence and intimidation to silence Hong Kong, the Chinese Communist Party is once again showing its true nature. Beijing recently reinforced its People's Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong with thousands of troops and authorized a new wave of arrests to intimidate peaceful demonstrators. In parallel, it reportedly blocked the Hong Kong government's proposal to work out a compromise
with the city's massive and grassroots pro-democracy movement.
What began as a protest against an unjust extradition bill backed by China has now become a fight for Hong Kong's autonomy and future. Yet what's happening in Hong Kong is not simply China's internal affair. The United States and other responsible nations are not watching from the sidelines.
The extradition bill is only the latest example of China's many broken promises to the Hong Kong people and the world. Most obviously, the Chinese Communist Party is preventing the city's government from acting with the autonomy that Beijing had promised it in a legally binding 1984 international treaty with Britain,
under Hong Kong's Basic Law, and in China's diplomatic outreach to the United States and other nations.
In 2014, Beijing also backed off its commitment to allow Hong Kong citizens to choose their city's chief executive through universal suffrage, a provocation that sparked the city's massive Umbrella Movement protests. And in 2016 and 2017
, the High Court disqualified
a total of six democratic lawmakers from their Legislative Council seats using a controversial interpretation of Hong Kong's constitution.

Thirty years after People's Liberation Army troops massacred reform activists and ordinary Chinese citizens on the way to Tiananmen Square, Beijing now appears poised to intervene overtly and aggressively in Hong Kong. 
The paramilitary People's Armed Police - built up in the aftermath of the Tiananmen massacre - has thousands of personnel and vehicles in Shenzhen, just across the boundary between mainland China and Hong Kong. Chinese officials and state media have steadily escalated their warning rhetoric and outlined what they describe as the legal case for intervention based on ""signs of terrorism."" An unsigned editorial in Xinhua, a state-run news agency reflecting the institutional voice of the party center, claimed that Hong Kong is engaged in a ""color revolution.""

The world ignores these warning signals at the peril of the Hong Kong people and the hundreds of thousands of foreigners - including roughly
85,000 U.S. citizens - living in the city. China's leaders today are using the same messaging playbook that they have followed since they intervened in North Korea in 1950. We were surprised then; we should be prepared now.
The United States and the international community must make clear to Chinese leaders and power brokers that their aggression toward Hong Kong risks swift, severe and lasting consequences.
In particular, the administration should make clear that the United States can respond flexibly and robustly in Hong Kong. Our options are much more than just a ""nuclear option"" of ending Hong Kong's special status under U.S. law.
The Hong Kong Policy Act, authored by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)
and enacted in 1992, allows the president to apply to Hong Kong those laws that address the People's Republic of China. The law's power is selective and flexible, however, and not necessarily all-or-nothing for Hong Kong's special status. For example, the Tiananmen sanctions could be applied to target the city's police force, which has collaborated with organized crime, instigated violence and now might be torturing detained demonstrators.
Hong Kong's special status - and therefore Beijing's ability to exploit and benefit from it - depends on the city being treated as a separate customs area, on open international financial connections and on the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the U.S. dollar. The United States both administratively and diplomatically can constrain these conditions.
The administration also can impose sanctions against individual officials who have committed serious human rights abuses under the Global Magnitsky Act, which enables sanctions against foreign individuals or entities. In addition, Congress should pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, a bill that I co-authored with Sens. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), James E. Risch (R-Idaho) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.). The bill, among other things, would mandate that officials in China and Hong Kong who have undermined the city's autonomy are vulnerable to such sanctions.

The United States and other nations have options precisely because Beijing benefits from Hong Kong's special status. Indeed, the city has proved irreplaceable as a gateway for international finance, even as China attempts to build up a mainland alternative. 
China's leaders must either respect Hong Kong's autonomy and rule of law or know that their escalating aggression will inexorably lead them to face swift, severe and lasting consequences from the United States and the world. Today, that choice is theirs.

The meaning of Hong Kong's protests,"THE LESSONS of recent events in Hong Kong start with the fact that an enormous number of people took to the streets in peaceful demonstrations against a rollback in the territory's guarantees of freedom and autonomy from China. The very size of the protests that filled Hong Kong's downtown, the largest in a generation, is a powerful reminder this is not a splinter movement but the mainstream speaking loud and clear. 
Another lesson is that Hong Kong's protesters are growing angrier and more distraught than they were before. In past years, it often appeared the opposition in Hong Kong was unfailingly orderly, simply asking China to fulfill its original promise to protect Hongkongers' freedoms. There was little public support for outright independence from China. But the latest demonstrations reflect a new edge of distrust and wariness that should worry the rulers in Beijing. 
The militancy is a direct result of China's gradual but inexorable tightening of the screws on Hong Kong, most recently through a proposed extradition law that would have undermined the territory's justice system. China's leaders, who supervise the Hong Kong executive, have no one but themselves to blame for the opposition's hardened attitude. 
In the most recent protest, furious young people broke into the offices of the Legislative Council, or Legco, smashing windows and vandalizing the chamber with spray paint. China immediately reacted by labeling the intruders ""extreme radicals"" and saying they carried out ""a series of large-scale assaults"" that are ""totally intolerable."" This may be just the initial knee-jerk reaction of China's propagandists. The leadership in Beijing should look deeper. The fury of these young people is a result of pent-up frustration that previous efforts had failed to halt the slide in Hong Kong's freedoms. They were incensed when, following the mass protests, the extradition bill was suspended but not canceled altogether. 
""The Hong Kong government was pushing us to the point of despair and desperation,"" said Joshua Wong, a leader of the 2014 protest movement, on Twitter. ""We tried every possible way imaginable to make our voices heard."" Graffiti scrawled on a wall in the Legco said, ""You taught me peaceful protests are futile.""
The young people must be careful not to give the Chinese Communist Party leaders in Beijing, or their underlings in Hong Kong, an excuse for more repression. Violence and vandalism invariably play into the hands of the Chinese leaders, who take fright at all signs of protest and democracy. In today's world, the students can be just as powerful hurling words as smashing windows.
The larger conclusion to be drawn is that China's leaders should abandon their old thinking. Repression will ultimately fail and generate more resistance. China can't grind down Hong Kong for another generation, and it would be terribly counterproductive to try."
First day of school in Hong Kong brings class boycotts,"HONG KONG - The 15-year-old student woke Monday morning, donned his school uniform of white shirt and blue pants, and left the Hong Kong apartment he shares with his parents and grandparents. 
But he had no intention of heading to school. He was among the thousands of students boycotting the first day of classes after a summer of sustained protests that have been fueled largely by teenagers like him. 
""My grandparents don't agree with me, so I had to pretend,"" the student, who wanted to be known only by his last name Wu, said at a rally in central Hong Kong he was attending instead of being in class. ""I put on my uniform like I was going to school, but came here instead."" 
Hong Kong's government had been hoping that once school started, the tensions - and occasional violence - that have played out weekend after weekend on the city's streets would subside. 
Students on Monday, however, hoped to send a clear message that they are not going anywhere and plan to continue to be the backbone of dissent against their government, the city's police force and Beijing's influence on their semiautonomous territory. 
Students plan to ""escalate"" their actions if the government doesn't meet their demands - raising the specter of even more unrest as Hong Kong's police force cracks down harder on protests and the city's government remains unwavering in its refusal to compromise. 
""Things will not just go back to normal just like that,"" said one 17-year-old student who gave only his last name, Chan. ""If the government does not respond to our demands, there is no way this will stop."" 
Protests have grown in intensity since June, originally sparked by plans to allow extraditions to mainland China. The past weekend saw some of the worst violence on city streets in months, with unprecedented police use of force and huge fires set by protesters. The crisis has unearthed deep grievances in Hong Kong, the most fundamental being the fear that Beijing wants to erode the city's freedoms and cultural uniqueness.
Chinese state media, meanwhile, have continued to escalate their rhetoric. The state-owned Xinhua News Agency said in an editorial that the ""end is coming for those attempting to disrupt Hong Kong and antagonize China.""

A deep rift has also been created between police and citizens as harsher tactics are being used to discourage the protests.Outside the gates of several high schools across the city on Monday morning, students and alumni in black surgical masks, helmets and respirators linked hands in protest. At St. Francis' Canossian College, an all-girls high school that counts Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam as one of its graduates, students held up signs that read: ""Chief Executive, will you listen to the voices of the younger sisters from your school?"" 

At Queen's College, students placed a hard hat, goggles and a respirator on a statue of Sun Yat-sen, known as the founder of modern China and the all-boys high school's most distinguished alumnus. 
In a news conference Tuesday, Hong Kong Education Secretary Kevin Yeung said schools ""should not be used as places for raising political demands or trying to exercise pressure on the government on political issues.""
""We would like to keep schools as a calm, peaceful and orderly place for students to study,"" he added.
Later in the afternoon, tens of thousands attended a rally at the Chinese University of Hong Kong despite a warning from school authorities that their gathering was ""risky"" and shouldn't be held. Students packed the center of campus and draped black banners on university buildings, including one reading ""Fight for Freedom."" 
Chants of ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time"" thundered across the campus, at times completely drowning out the speakers addressing the enormous crowd.
Universities in Hong Kong - which up until this point in the protests have been in summer recess - are expected to be the new battleground for tensions between mainland Chinese and Hong Kongers.
Already there have been clashes on college campuses in Australia and elsewhere in the world between those supporting the Hong Kong protests and those backing Beijing's stance.
Students from the mainland make up a huge chunk of university students in Hong Kong, and many of them cannot understand why the local students are taking to the street. 
Before the rally at Chinese University, one mainland Chinese student ripped up a protest banner and yelled that he supported the Hong Kong police. ""Students should study, not strike!"" he screamed, according to a witness.Almost all of the dozen or so students interviewed by The Washington Post mentioned police attacks and their use of force as a key reason for their continued participation in protests and Monday's boycotts. 

On Saturday, police stormed subway trains and swung their batons and shot pepper spray at protesters and ordinary citizens cowering in the carriages. Police said they were responding to ""violent acts"" and vandalism in the stations. 

Police made 159 arrests between Friday and Sunday, they said in a news conference, including at the subway stations. Almost a thousand people have been arrested on charges relating to the protests since June, including dozens on harsh riot charges. 

""My heart is broken from the police brutality,"" said Jerry Liu, a 15-year-old student also boycotting class. ""Skipping school is nothing compared to our brothers and sisters who dare to go out and fight . . .
for our freedoms.""

The school boycotts coincided with a call for a general strike on Monday and an effort to once again disrupt transportation networks in Hong Kong. The plans however appeared to have limited effect, as officers in riot gear waited at subway stations to arrest anyone who tried to hold doors open. Officers made eight more arrests on Monday morning. 

About 40,000 people joined a rally to mark the strike in Tamar Park, near the Legislative Council building. Some protesters later gathered around government buildings close to a police cordon and were pushed back with pepper spray.
Police also stopped and searched students outside high schools around the city. Officers stopped alumni who were handing out pamphlets and brochures in support of protests outside their high schools, and searched their backpacks. 
""We are not afraid, these are just scare tactics,"" said Isaac Cheng, a 19-year-old university student who helped organize a rally for secondary school students. ""In our fight for freedom and our fight for democracy, we must overcome our fear.""

Protests close Hong Kong airport,"China calls actions 'terrorism,' moves troops toward border
HONG KONG - Thousands of protesters shut down Hong Kong's international airport Monday, defying an intensifying police crackdown, as China issued ominous warnings that described the protests as ""terrorism"" and began massing a paramilitary force in a southern border city.
Fears have been mounting that Beijing - squeezed by a trade dispute with the United States and approaching a nationwide celebration of the founding of the People's Republic of China - will soon resort to military action to quell the pro-democracy protests in the semiautonomous territory. Chinese officials and state news media actively stoked those fears Monday.
""The radical demonstrators in Hong Kong have repeatedly attacked police with extremely dangerous tools in recent days, which constitutes a serious violent crime, and now they are descending into terrorism,"" said Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office in Beijing. It was the first time the office had portrayed the protests in Hong Kong as ""terrorism.""
""We should relentlessly crack down on such violent criminal acts without mercy, and we firmly support Hong Kong police and judicial authorities in bringing the criminals to justice as soon as possible,"" Yang told reporters from state and Hong Kong media.The nationalist Global Times tabloid tweeted a video showing Chinese armored personnel carriers heading toward the southern city of Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, ahead of what the paper called ""large-scale exercises"" by the People's Armed Police, a paramilitary unit. ""The tasks and missions of the Armed Police include participating in dealing with rebellions, riots, serious violent and illegal incidents, terrorist attacks and other social security incidents,"" the newspaper elaborated in an accompanying story.
And China's state broadcaster, CCTV, issued a commentary Monday night in which it warned: ""No country can accept terrorist acts in its own country … Hong Kong has reached an important juncture. 'End violence and restore order' is the most important, urgent and overriding task of Hong Kong at present!""
Some of the protesters who had been occupying the airport's arrivals hall swarmed into the departures area Monday, prompting authorities to cancel all flights and advise travelers to leave one of the world's busiest hubs. Airport operations resumed Tuesday morning, though there were some delays and cancellations stemming from the previous night's disruption.

Monday's protest came in response to a sharp increase in the level of force employed by Hong Kong's embattled police. Hours before the airport shutdown, two police officers elsewhere in the city pinned a black-clad demonstrator to the concrete, one officer's knee pressing the young man's face into a pool of his own blood.
""I've already been arrested,"" the man yelled as he cried for help. ""Don't do this, I'm begging you.""The scene, captured Sunday night by a cameraman from the Hong Kong Free Press, was jarring even in a city now accustomed to weekends awash with tear gas. It unleashed a fresh wave of anger toward Hong Kong's police force and the government more broadly, spurring thousands of demonstrators to respond by occupying the airport.
At the airport Monday, officials had halted all departures by late afternoon, affecting tens of thousands of passengers.
Hong Kong's airport authority said all flights were suspended Monday at about 3:30 p.m. local time (3:30 a.m. Eastern time).
After sitting in the arrivals hall for much of the day, many protesters began leaving the airport in the evening amid rumors on social media and messaging apps that police were preparing for a large clearance operation.

On Sunday night, Hong Kong police intensified their crackdown with new and more aggressive tactics after more than two months of sustained protests and more than 600 arrests.
Officers disguised themselves as protesters to arrest suspects, launched tear gas inside a subway station and fired on protesters at close range with less-than-lethal ammunition. One young woman was shot in the face with what appeared to be a bean bag round, severely injuring her eye. Police said Monday that the videos and photos had to be verified and that they could not confirm ""the reasoning behind this lady's injury.""But the incident provided the latest rallying point for protesters.
""The police have had enough, to be honest. They feel like they have been bullied for two months now, and they knew themselves more than capable to use real force and tactics to control the situation,"" said Clement Lai, a former police superintendent who now runs his own security firm.
""If the order was given that they need to escalate their action and their force, these guys are more than happy to do that.""The police actions appear to be part of broader efforts by the Hong Kong government, with the support of officials in Beijing, to end the political crisis, through an approach that includes ramping up pressure on businesses, leveling heavy charges against arrested protesters and using state-controlled media to pump out increasingly shrill, conspiratorial claims about who is organizing the demonstrations.
""After a period of several weeks of uncertainty as to who was coordinating the government response, last week saw the rollout of Beijing's multipronged, comprehensive strategy to deal with the protests,"" said Sebastian Veg, a historian of China and a professor at the School of Advanced Studies in Social Sciences in Paris.

""The aim is to turn public opinion against the protests by drastically raising the cost of participation.""
The new police tactics came after former deputy police commissioner Alan Lau was called out of retirement last week to help the embattled force.
Lai credited the new approach, in part, to Lau's return. ""He is coming back with a mission,"" the former superintendent said.
Hospital officials said that 45 people were injured in weekend protests and that 25 remained hospitalized. Two were in serious condition.One police officer who has worked on the front lines over the past month said officers' new ploy of disguising themselves as protesters - wearing masks, yellow hard hats and black civilian clothes - was a deliberate tactic from the police Special Duties Unit, nicknamed the ""Flying Tigers,"" to sow mistrust among protesters.
This is a tactic they will continue to use, the officer said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters. Police on Monday also displayed trucks mounted with water cannons that they could deploy to disperse crowds.
One 22-year-old protester who has been on the front line for weeks admitted that the more aggressive moves by police had caught some demonstrators off guard and yielded results.
""It was quite effective for them; they are changing their strategy,"" he said. ""We know now the police have no limits. They will not follow the rules and the law.""
The government, in what has become a weekly ritual, condemned protesters Monday and said a police officer was injured after being hit with a firebomb tossed by a demonstrator.

"China threatens force in Hong Kong, hoping words will suffice, analysts say","Xi faces rising pressure to quell protests ahead of anniversary celebration

BEIJING -
China's leaders were battered by a
typhoon
over the weekend during their annual Communist Party retreat at Beidaihe, a coastal resort where senior officials have gathered each August for more than six decades.

But President Xi Jinping and his comrades have also been weathering a political storm, with the growing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong adding to pressure on a regime already locked in a damaging trade war with the United States.
""Xi Jinping and the rest of the Chinese leadership are under siege,"" said Elizabeth Economy, a China expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. 
""The Chinese economy is slowing significantly, exacerbated by the trade war, and the 'China model' is cracking under the weight of Xinjiang, Taiwan, Belt and Road messes and, most significantly, the massive protests in Hong Kong,"" she said, referring to China's efforts at control and influence within its borders and beyond.
The protests in Hong Kong, which have intensified over the summer as demonstrators clamor for greater freedoms and rights, show no sign of petering out. In fact, Hong Kong students are making plans to demonstrate when universities resume classes next month. 
That would take the protests uncomfortably close to celebrations planned on Oct. 1 to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which was established with the goal of unifying greater China under the leadership of the Communist Party.
To have a quasi-secessionist movement in one territory - Hong Kong - inspiring young people in what Beijing considers a renegade province - Taiwan - on such an important anniversary would be too much for Xi to bear, analysts say.
This week, state-affiliated media outlets tweeted ominous videos of Chinese military vehicles carrying out exercises in Shenzhen, the southern Chinese city that borders Hong Kong, while authorities in Beijing portrayed the protests as ""terrorism."" 
""By calling what is going on 'terrorism,' it seems they're paving the way to intervene,"" said Victoria Tin-bor Hui, an expert on Hong Kong pro-democracy movements at the University of Notre Dame. ""That's making everyone very worried.""
China already stands accused of sending in thugs from local gangs to try to deter the protesters in Hong Kong, and there are growing concerns that it will send in the People's Armed Police, a paramilitary force responsible for internal security and ""stability maintenance,"" or perhaps even the People's Liberation Army.
But most analysts think that Beijing will stop short of sending in troops. 
""From Beijing's perspective, they don't have a lot of good options here. That's why they are using the most stringent language possible, so they don't need to actually use force and violence to unravel the protests,"" said Jude Blanchette, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
""The calculation from Beijing is pretty dire despite all the levers that they can potentially pull,"" he said. 
Those levers could include sending in soldiers or police forces in plain clothes, relying on gang members to rough up demonstrators, or launching patriotic counterprotests. 
Beijing is also trying to pressure commercial interests to stop the protests. In recent days, Chinese authorities have suggested that Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong-based airline, is unsafe to fly because some of its employees have joined the demonstrations.
Xi's reluctance to resort to military force is partly because the party wants to avoid a repeat of 1989, when it sent tanks into Tiananmen Square in Beijing to break up pro-democracy protests, and partly because it doesn't want to shoulder the blame for any violence.
Hong Kong has enjoyed special international status since its return to Chinese control in 1997, recognized by countries including the United States and agencies such as the World Trade Organization as a separate entity for economic and trade purposes. 
That has enabled the territory to remain a global financial center, but it has also benefited China. 
Mainland companies registered in Hong Kong are able to get around the Trump administration's tariffs imposed over the past year, and Hong Kong entities can continue to import sensitive technology that might be banned for mainland firms.
That's a strong deterrent to using military force, said Ho-Fung Hung, a specialist on Chinese protests at Johns Hopkins University.
""Military intervention is still out of the question unless Xi Jinping is very unwise,"" he said. ""If they use the PLA or the PAP, then Xi and the Central Military Commission will be taking responsibility for what happens next. If they use the Hong Kong police forces, then they can blame those authorities for anything that happens."" 
More likely, said Clayton Dube, head of the U.S.-China Institute at the University of Southern California, is that Beijing will try to wait it out.
""I think that, as in 2014, the demonstrators will be worn out and some of them will be arrested and jailed,"" said Dube, referring to the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement that lasted for a little more than 11 weeks. The current protests have reached that mark already.
But waiting out the unrest risks failing to resolve longer-term issues concerning Hong Kong's governance.
""It doesn't mean that the issues go away, and it doesn't mean that the hostility, the anger and the frustration are dissipated,"" Dube said. ""In fact, that's one reason why the crowds are even bigger in 2019 than they were in 2014.""
Still, for the Chinese leader, the biggest challenge remains the domestic economy. Growth has slowed to its weakest in almost 30 years
This slowdown is exacerbated by the trade war with the United States, which is affecting China's huge manufacturing industry and shaking confidence.
Ironically, the trade war could help Xi undercut the Hong Kong protests. 
Authorities in Beijing have repeatedly accused ""hostile foreign forces,"" especially the United States, of fomenting unrest inside China's borders

""As the possibility of a deal with the U.S. becomes more remote, it opens up avenues to blame 'shadowy forces' orchestrated and organized by the U.S.,"" Blanchette said. ""If things were going well in the trade talks, it would have made it more difficult to play that card.""

Fears of a 'police state' growing in Hong Kong,"Authorities crack downas anti-government protests continue
HONG KONG - Tens of thousands of Hong Kong protesters gathered Saturday for an ""emergency"" rally in support of autonomy for the Chinese territory, underscoring the continued support for a movement now in its 22nd week. 
As the demonstrations drag on, however, authorities have grown more resolute in trying to end them. 
Saturday's crowd was overwhelmingly peaceful, but the march wasn't sanctioned. Police quickly fired tear gas on the crowd at Victoria Park, a frequent gathering spot for the large and peaceful marches that defined Hong Kong's protest culture before demonstrations veered toward violence in recent months. 
Later in the day, protesters started building barricades to block major roads, vandalized pro-Beijing businesses and threw petrol bombs, some aimed at police. Demonstrators also targeted the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, smashing windows and setting fires at the building's facade. There were no reported injuries at the Xinhua office. 
Police said they were forced to cancel two previously authorized rallies because of ""violent conflicts"" and ""breach of peace"" in Hong Kong.
Ventus Lau, an activist who has been arrested multiple times during the protests, applied for the initial permit for the Victoria Park rally. He said the government's efforts to stifle sanctioned events were only adding to the anger.
""If they allowed us to have some channels for people to express themselves, most protesters will act in a peaceful and rational manner,"" he said. ""Now, the only option is joining illegal protests and rallies.""
Since police had declined to authorize Saturday's rally, protest organizers attempted to circumvent the ban by having pro-democracy candidates for upcoming local elections hold individual rallies in the park at the same time. Pro-democracy candidates are expected to win big in the elections amid growing mistrust in institutions like the government and the police, seen to be aiding Beijing in eroding Hong Kong's freedoms. 
The candidates said they would not need permission for these campaign meetings if they did not exceed more than 50 people each. But when the crowd swelled to thousands, the police quickly warned that they were gathering illegally and sought to disperse them. Protesters then made their way to central Hong Kong, where two authorized rallies were due to be held later in the evening.Some of these pro-democracy candidates were pepper-sprayed and at least one was arrested as they tried to lead protesters in a march. Most have passed a process of political screening and have been approved as candidates - except for prominent activist Joshua Wong. 
Many protesters have remained defiant, ignoring the frequent bans on marches and continuing to wear masks at demonstrations despite a new law outlawing facial coverings at public gatherings.
""The anti-mask law should not be our concern, since it is inappropriate and a violation of the rule of law,"" said a 28-year-old protester, asking to be identified only by his last name, Chan, for fear of retribution. He was huddled among thousands of protesters in the Wan Chai neighborhood, blocked by police from marching further. ""Nothing will stop us from coming up, but we have to assess every situation carefully, since police keep blocking us."" 
Earlier in the day, police officers stopped and searched vehicles entering the Central district of Hong Kong Island, where the financial hub of the city and key government offices are located. The area surrounding the offices has been a flash point for protesters for months. Police also frisked dozens of people on the city's streets, lining up people on the sidewalks as they checked IDs and searched their bags and belongings. Others had their cellphones searched.""I was so scared,"" said 27-year-old Jacky, who was stopped and searched by the police, along with 10 others wearing black masks. He had not been out to a protest since June, afraid of the escalating violence, but wanted to participate in Saturday's march. ""I think they are aiming their force at us, the younger generations."" 
Jacky was with hundreds of other protesters when a water cannon came barreling down the road, causing them to scatter. 
""This is just a peaceful rally. Why are they firing tear gas at us?"" he asked. 
In the afternoon, dozens of young people were arrested in a small playground and recreational area, some of them grabbed from the public bathroom. They were forced to line up against a wall in an alleyway, while police kept press and passersby behind a cordon. Later, they were bundled into buses in a single file and brought to a nearby police station.
By Saturday night, hundreds of lawyers, relatives and friends waited outside the North Point police station for news on those held. One woman told The Washington Post that she had not been able to see her husband, among those arrested, because police were processing more than 200 people held at that station alone. The woman spoke on the condition of anonymity because her husband was still in custody.
A swift move from Beijing to end the protests, which some feared could bring a Tiananmen-style crackdown, has not happened. However, protesters, pro-democracy lawmakers and ordinary residents have begun to refer to the city as a ""police state."" Masked riot police dressed in olive green fatigues now regularly patrol subway stations and can be seen positioned throughout neighborhoods across Hong Kong. 
""There is no rule of law in Hong Kong now,"" said Fung, a 73-year-old protester who had walked from Victoria Park. ""Police can arrest people for whatever reason, as much as they want. They write the rules of the game.""
The police force, which has the full backing of Chief Executive Carrie Lam, regularly denies permission for rallies and marches. Additionally, a number of injunctions filed by the government have been granted in recent weeks. One bars people from insulting or pestering police officers or their family members. Another aims to block messages inciting violence on forums and messaging apps popular with protesters. Activists and some lawyers have criticized the injunctions as being overly broad and duplicating existing law. 
Police, who have arrested nearly 3,000 people since protests began in June, have complained of thousands of officers being doxed and threatened. Officers have also come under attack from protesters wielding bricks, rods and petrol bombs. Two protesters have been shot but are expected to recover. 
Lam said recently that the ""most effective solution is to tackle the violence head-on,"" when asked about solving the crisis, which has sent her approval rating plummeting and has driven Hong Kong into a recession. Lam is on a visit to Shanghai and Nanjing and was not in Hong Kong on Saturday.

Hong Kong's pushback,"HONG KONG's remarkable surge of protest against a bill allowing for extradition to the Chinese mainland has been an inspiration in these times of rising authoritarianism. An estimated 2 million people have demanded to be heard on a piece of legislation by marching through the canyons of a city they want to preserve as a beacon of openness and free markets. But with the protests comes anxiety: How will the protests translate into results, and how will the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing and its de facto subordinates in Hong Kong react?
The sea of people across the length of downtown Hong Kong undoubtedly sent shivers down the spine of Chinese President Xi Jinping. His principle of governing since 2012 has been to enforce the party's supremacy as the paternalistic guiding force, stamping out independent thought and action. This is a direct legacy of the brutal force that was used to squelch the 1989 democracy protest in Tiananmen Square that remains a major factor in the thinking - and nightmares - of China's leaders. They fear people power more than anything else. Throngs of independent-minded Hong Kong people on the streets, directly and openly opposing a policy of the Beijing overlords, is a challenge to everything Mr. Xi stands for. It comes after a years-long attempt to whittle away the freedoms promised Hong Kong in the 1997 handover, which envisioned ""one country, two systems"" for 50 years. China had earlier declared that model dead. Hong Kong's people beg to disagree.

The half-measures of Carrie Lam, the embattled Hong Kong leader, suspending the bill and issuing an apology, were not enough. She should abandon the legislation as drafted, which could open the door to China grabbing dissidents or others from Hong Kong and bundling them off for prosecution and punishment on the mainland, where the party is above the law.
Mr. Xi ought to realize that the Hong Kong protests are tangible evidence that Chinese people can and do understand democracy, and do not have to live in an authoritarian straitjacket. Just look at Taiwan. He should see that China would reap greater rewards from an open and prosperous Hong Kong than if the city-state were transformed into a sulking, embittered prisoner of Beijing. However, this would require Mr. Xi to finally shake off the ghosts of Tiananmen and the party's dread of freedom of expression, assembly, press, conscience and movement. His record unfortunately suggests that he is more likely to wait until things calm down and then try again, gradually suffocating Hong Kong in the bosom of China's unfreedom. Already, Beijing has tried to wave away the protests with the old canard that it is foreign meddling.

Hong Kong enjoys special economic status with the United States under a 1992 law
that recognizes that it is different from China. This offers leverage for the Trump administration and Congress to urge China to let Hong Kong breathe, or risk losing the benefits.
But the next move is up to China's leaders. They should listen to the footfalls on the streets of Hong Kong."
Hong Kong's summer of discontent,"HONG KONG'S political battleground has expanded. Protesters who in June demanded cancellation of an extradition bill that would make it easier for suspects to be transferred to mainland China are now asking for greater democracy and an investigation of police brutality. The demonstrators have shifted tactics, too, from sprawling marches to smaller, unpredictable flash-mobs, as well as intrusions such as the airport protest on Monday that led to massive flight cancellations. China's leadership has misread the situation from the start. Time to get this right. 
China gained control over Hong Kong from England in 1997, pledging autonomy for a city that has come to define capitalism and freedom in Asia. Gradually, China has been whittling down those liberties, including by suppressing the ""Umbrella Movement"" in 2014, refusing to allow direct elections for chief executive, kidnapping five Hong Kong booksellers
and attempting to impose the extradition bill. When protests erupted over the extradition proposal, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam should have immediately canceled it. Instead, Ms. Lam, more sensitive to the demands of her overlords in Beijing than to the values that underlie Hong Kong's success, tried to sidestep the issue with some obfuscation. It didn't work.
Another miscalculation was to assume that the protests would simply flare out. The protests are a political groundswell, a reflection of genuine popular anger and commitment to democracy. But authorities treated the protesters as ""terrorists"" and ""rioters,"" a law enforcement problem to be handled by the Hong Kong police, who have repeatedly overreacted, including this weekend when they fired tear gas into a subway station and were discovered using undercover officers to infiltrate the demonstrators. In response, some protesters have turned more violent, unwisely resorting to vandalism, throwing bricks and a petrol bomb, and disruption.
Yet another mistake of the Chinese authorities has been to roll out the boogeyman that the protests are inspired by foreigners. China's state media have trotted out the ghost that seems to frighten all authoritarians, calling the protests a ""color revolution"" instigated by the United States. The charge seems almost comical given President Trump's lack of sympathy for democracy movements anywhere in the world. But it speaks volumes about paranoia in the Communist Party that holds a monopoly on power in China. This protest movement is very much indigenous to Hong Kong and its people.
Lately, there have been dark hints of a stronger crackdown by the military. But repeating the catastrophe of Tiananmen Square would be terribly counterproductive; hopefully China's leaders understand as much. They might be hoping to slowly strangle the protest movement without violence and without giving an inch. This would be yet another miscalculation because the pent-up demands of this summer won't go away.
The right answer for President Xi Jinping and for Ms. Lam, if she remains in office, is to open serious negotiations with the protesters on their demands, which are quite reasonable. Cinching the noose ever tighter, as the Chinese government has done in recent weeks, is the pathway to a dead end that could harm both Hong Kong and mainland China economically as well as politically. A cliff looms, and China's leaders should turn back before it is too late."
"Hong Kong's Halloween brings a mash-up of partyers, protesters","HONG KONG - Halloween revelry in Hong Kong clashed Thursday with the reality of protests and emergency restrictions now in place, as police struggled to manage a crowd of demonstrators deliberately intermingled with costumed partygoers in a major nightlife district.
The result was a surreal mix of costumed residents, tourists and expatriates swilling cocktails, chugging beers and dancing in popular party districts in central Hong Kong, while steps away on parallel streets, protesters were hurling insults and chanting ""Gangster! Gangster!"" at riot police, who pushed them back with tear gas and pepper spray.

In Kowloon, police clashed with a separate group of protesters commemorating those who were injured two months ago when officers stormed a subway station and struck protesters and commuters with batons.
Ahead of the Halloween celebrations, usually boisterous affairs in Hong Kong and a chance for its bars and clubs to cash in on one of the most profitable nights of the year, police warned that a ban on masks and face paint would continue to be enforced. 
""Police officers are empowered, if necessary, to ask anyone in a public place to remove their face masks and face coverings, or wipe off their face paint to verify their identity,"" Police Superintendent Louis Lau said in a video message posted on Facebook. He warned that police could arrest anyone who resists, emphasizing, ""Everyone must comply."" ""Police do not rule out the possibility of any violent incident happening,"" Lau added.
After violent demonstrations on Oct. 1, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam used emergency powers to enact a ban on face masks at protests. Lam had hoped the ban would quell violence at protests, but it immediately had the opposite effect, further inflaming tensions and intensifying concerns over the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong. Pro-democracy lawmakers are challenging the ban in court, with further arguments to be heard Friday. 

Demonstrations have continued every weekend in various districts across the territory, while Lam's approval ratings have slumped below 20 percent. The Hong Kong economy has entered a recession, as gross domestic product from the third quarter has shrunk by 3.2 percent, according to government estimates released Thursday. 

Aware of the potential for confusion and chaos on Halloween, protesters
staged an unsanctioned march
ending in Lan Kwai Fong in central Hong Kong, one of the most famous party streets in the world. 
Bars and entertainment venues there are usually packed on Halloween, with costumed revelers spilling out into the district's narrow streets, where people drink in the open. It is particularly popular with tourists and expatriates. Protesters previously had avoided the area, sticking to more politically significant locations.
In Lan Kwai Fong, a person in an inflatable green alien costume danced and posed for pictures in front of a line of about a dozen riot police as the crowd swelled early in the night and police shouted directions in an effort to control the group.When more marchers arrived to join the crowds in Lan Kwai Fong, police held them back, cordoning off major streets. Onlookers and tourists on crowded sidewalks drank beer as they took in the scene, while traffic was gridlocked behind them. At one point, police arrested a woman in black angel wings and a red dress who screamed for an ambulance.
""I never expected the police to block the road on Halloween,"" said a man who identified himself only as Chan and carried his 4-year-old on his back. ""My daughter was so disappointed and scared.""
A 40-year-old woman in a devil costume walked with hundreds of other protesters to demonstrate defiance of the mask ban, chanting, ""Five demands, not one less,"" referring to protesters' demands, only one of which has been met. 
Others chanted a riff on ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times"" - a popular mantra of protesters - changing it to ""Liberate Lan Kwai Fong, I want to drink."" 
Later in the night, dozens of riot police officers pushed down a busy street lined with bars, with patrons seemingly confused over how seriously to take the situation. 
A man dressed as Pennywise the clown from the horror novel and film ""It"" rushed ahead of the police line, urging people to get off the street and indoors. Another man in a police officer costume complete with a bushy mustache snapped selfies with the advancing riot officers as a backdrop.

Hong Kong's Lam meets with public,"Leader faces a flood of criticism; protesters try to bar exit from stadium

HONG KONG - Tight-lipped and stoic, embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam faced a barrage of criticism Thursday during a dialogue with randomly selected members of the public - her first attempt to directly engage with people in the semiautonomous Chinese territory after 17 weeks of spiraling unrest and violence. 
""You may be an excellent administrator, but you don't know how to be a politician,"" one member of the audience told her.
""Hong Kongers are stronger than you imagine - five demands, not one less!"" exclaimed a young man in a suit, noting the protesters' list of needed reforms and inquests.
The pointed and unvarnished questions Lam faced - coupled with a protest outside the stadium where the exchanges were going on - made clear the depth of mistrust in Hong Kong's institutions and Lam's fraught position ahead of what is likely to be another chaotic weekend of violent protests leading up to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on Tuesday.
After the meeting, hundreds of protesters gathered around the venue's exits and built barricades in an apparent effort to stop Lam and other officials from leaving, ignoring police warnings to disperse. Police finally escorted her into a black sedan four hours after the event ended.

Lam's dialogue, envisioned as conversations with a wide range of Hong Kong residents, was among the concessions she offered earlier this month when she announced the full withdrawal of a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China - one of the protesters' five demands. Critics at the time said she was out of step with the expectations and focus of the protesters, who have come to be more concerned about police use of force and are again demanding direct elections for Hong Kong leaders.
More than 20,000 applied to take part in the dialogue, and of those, 150 were randomly selected to participate. Of the 30 people chosen to speak, more than 20 were critical of authorities and supportive of protesters. 
The flavor of the event was clear from the outset. Police had planned various routes to bring Lam into and out of the stadium, a 3,500-seat indoor sports arena, after forums online discussed blocking her path. Riot police carting cases full of crowd-control equipment were seen filing into the stadium in the afternoon. Police presence in the area was heavy.
Lam began the dialogue session by telling attendees that it was not a mere public relations exercise and that it was ""time to communicate."" She was flanked by other members of her government, including the secretary of home affairs and the secretary of constitutional and mainland affairs, who is responsible for managing Hong Kong's relationship with China.
Although Beijing has upped the threats and rhetoric around the protests, it has largely been up to Hong Kong police to suppress dissent that has sometimes spiraled into violence. Hong Kong's police force, once among the most respected in Asia, has been accused of using unreasonable force against protesters.
Human rights groups and U.N. officials - along with many Hong Kong residents, including some in the pro-Beijing camp - have called for a fully independent investigation of the police department.
Lam, however, continues to insist that the Independent Police Complaints Council is up to the task, an assertion she repeated in the face of criticism Thursday. But there is deep distrust of the organization, which lacks the ability to call witnesses and which critics think is staffed by officials loyal to Lam. 
""A commission of inquiry is one way to find out the truth,"" she said Thursday. ""But we should give the Independent Police Complaints Council a chance to do their job first.""
Chants from the protesters gathered outside the stadium were so loud that they could, at times, be heard inside. Among the demonstrators was a 45-year-old salesman who decried the dialogue as a ""show.""
""We cannot trust the government,"" said the man, who wanted to be identified only as Li.

Li added that he will be among those protesting on Tuesday, the anniversary of the People's Republic of China. Large protests are planned over the weekend and on the day itself, as protesters seek to make clear that they reject Beijing's tight control over their city, which was promised significant autonomy when the British handed it over in 1997.
Those freedoms were meant to be preserved for 50 years, until 2047, and questions remain about what the next steps will be for Hong Kong. One speaker on Thursday put it to Lam this way: ""You will be 90 by 2047, so it won't matter to you by then. But I am 26 now and will be 55 in 2047. Do we have a future then?""
Lam concluded the Thursday session by promising more conversation and pledged to work to restore trust in her government. But questions have surfaced about whether she is truly in charge, and officials have acknowledged that they have limited room to maneuver in the face of a more assertive Beijing, which insists on no further concessions to the movement.

Restive Hong Kong still vital to Beijing,"With mainland China's economic rise, Hong Kong is no longer the undisputed center for business and finance in the region. But it still plays an indispensable role that Beijing will be loath to undermine, according to bankers, economists and business leaders.
Pro-democracy protests that have intensified over the summer on Hong Kong's streets have raised concerns about how far China's Communist Party will go to quell the unrest. From a business and finance point of view, it walks a fine line, experts say.
Hong Kong is still an essential bridge between China and the wider world, providing a place where Chinese companies can easily raise money from global investors and where thousands of foreign companies feel secure basing their operations.
""Hong Kong is just a very convenient construct for both China and the rest of the world,"" said Richard Marston, an emeritus finance professor at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. ""It's not in China's interest nor in the rest of the world's interest to have Hong Kong's status changed.""
Weeks of instability have shaken that foundation. Hong Kong retail sales fell 6.7 percent in June from a year earlier, hurt by store closures and weakening consumer sentiment amid the protests, according to a retail association. The Hang Seng Index, representing stocks traded in Hong Kong, is down 16 percent from its high point in April.
""The uncertainty, the lack of seeing any kind of outlook as to a more positive and reasonable resolution to this situation is deeply worrying,"" said Charles Mok, a tech entrepreneur and pro-democracy lawmaker representing the IT sector, an official constituency, in Hong Kong's 70-seat legislature. This week, Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, offered little in terms of measures to quell the upheaval, he said. ""Basically, she hasn't said anything,"" Mok said.
Hong Kong's economy has been slowing since January 2018 and grew just 0.6 percent in the first and second quarters of this year, which economists attributed largely to China's economic slowdown and the U.S.-China trade war. Some warn continuing unrest could further weaken the economy.
""I expect we will see large falls in output in July and August this year when we get the data,"" said Neil Shearing, the group chief economist at Capital Economics in London. If the protests wane as students return to school in the fall, Hong Kong's economy could quickly rebound, he said. A worst-case scenario, in which Beijing sends in troops, could trigger an outflow of capital from the territory, a spike in interest rates and the collapse of the property market, which is overvalued, he said.
Fitch Ratings has held Hong Kong's AA+ credit rating steady this summer, saying that any disruption from the protests would not alter the territory's fundamental strength. 
""Nevertheless, some of the assumptions underpinning that rating are currently being tested, including the effectiveness of the territory's governance and its rule of law,"" Fitch said in a July 29 research note.
Tara Joseph, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, said recent events ""have really harmed Hong Kong in the short term."" Some business travelers have canceled trips to the territory, and some are wondering whether upcoming conferences will be scrapped, she said.
Mainland Chinese cities have increasingly challenged Hong Kong's role in recent years. Some U.S. companies have moved their Chinese headquarters to Beijing or Shanghai. Shenzhen has incubated a fast-growing tech sector. Beijing is home to the largest state-owned banks, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange competes closely with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
But those cities cannot duplicate some of the advantages that make Hong Kong important to Beijing and the West, business people say. Unlike China, Hong Kong has no capital controls, meaning investors can freely move money in and out of the territory. That has made it a logical place for Chinese companies seeking international investors to list their shares on a stock exchange. Markets inside China are largely geared toward domestic investors. And Hong Kong's legal system, based on English common law, makes for a more secure and familiar place for international firms to sign contracts, engage in arbitration and base operations.
""Despite the protests, which hopefully will be resolved by the Hong Kong and the Chinese governments soon, there are still some fundamental factors that will keep Hong Kong as the preferred financial center in the region,"" said Anthony Siu, the managing director in Shanghai for BDA Partners, an investment bank.
Hong Kong also gives China a kind of soft power that is valuable to Beijing, economists say.
""It's a global city, a global financial center where people from all over the world want to be. There are very few of those in the world - New York, London, Paris, Hong Kong,"" Shearing, of Capital Economics. said. It's an important place ""from the perspective of China's role in the world,"" he said.
