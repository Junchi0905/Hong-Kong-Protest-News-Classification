"From the Shadows, China’s Communist Party Mobilizes Against Hong Kong Protests","HONG KONG — Across the border from Hong Kong, the Chinese Communist Party screams its presence with banners and slogans on nearly every street. Yet in the former British colony, where China’s ruling party confronts what it calls a “life and death” struggle against a turbulent protest movement, it is invisible: It is not registered and has no publicly declared local members.
But in Hong Kong, this officially nonexistent organization is in the vanguard of defending Chinese rule in the face of its biggest public resistance since the authoritarian leader Xi Jinping came to power in 2012. The party, operating in the shadows through individuals and organizations, is driving an increasingly firm pushback against the antigovernment protests, now in their 12th week.
Parroting slogans scripted by the Communist Party on the mainland, activists in a host of local pro-China organizations have mobilized to discredit the protesters as violent hooligans bent on wrecking the city. It is a message supported by the party’s main proxy in the territory, the Central Liaison Office in Hong Kong, which formally represents the Chinese government.
They mostly ignore the huge peaceful protests and focus instead on the periodic clashes between small bands of protesters and police officers, who this weekend fired rounds of tear gas and used water cannon trucks for the first time against brick-throwing demonstrators.
Representatives of 15 pro-Beijing business groups and associations linked to Chinese provinces gathered recently in a Hong Kong office block to take turns reciting pledges of support for China. They then stood together, pumping their fists and chanting in unison: “Stop the violence, end the turmoil.”
The event was organized by the Fujian Hometown Association, which represents immigrants to Hong Kong from Fujian, an eastern Chinese province, and their descendants.
The association has no formal links to the Communist Party, which in Hong Kong has operated covertly since it put down roots with just seven members nearly a century ago, under British rule. The colonial authorities outlawed the party, which took power in Beijing in 1949, but tolerated its existence, so long as it stayed out of sight.
By the time China took back the city in 1997, the underground party apparatus had grown to include thousands of members and many thousands of supporters outside its formal ranks. Mobilization efforts have increased since, reaching a fever pitch in recent days as groups like the Fujian association have plunged into politics, rallying members to denounce the protest movement.
That the party itself has stayed in the background reflects China’s effort to resolve a fundamental question at the heart of “one country, two systems,” the formula under which Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule: How does a highly authoritarian one-party state assert its influence in a politically diverse, freewheeling city without making it “one country, one system”?
The party’s answer has been to operate out of the Central Liaison Office. Its director, Wang Zhimin, and his deputy are both former party officials in Fujian.
The office’s most important, and least known, duties include supervising a covert network of Communist Party members and coordinating the activities of groups involved in what the party calls the United Front. The United Front effort in Hong Kong began during China’s civil war in the 1930s, with the aim of attracting as many Hong Kongers as possible to the party’s camp.
Individuals and organizations in this loose alliance, while not necessarily pro-Communist, have rallied to the party’s side out of opportunism or a shared patriotic commitment to making China prosperous and powerful. It has also at times included gangsters, who attacked protesters and passengers with metal bars at a railway station on the Kowloon Peninsula late last month.
The Fujian association’s chairman, the 60-year-old businessman Chau On Ta Yuen, denied being a member of Hong Kong’s underground Communist Party — an organization he insisted had never existed.
All the same, Mr. Chau said: “Of course I love the Communist Party. It has done so many good things.” Particularly good, he said, is the latitude it has given Hong Kong to make money. Without stability, he added, “there is no way to do business.”
Mr. Chau does, however, sit on the standing committee of a top body in mainland China that advises the central government — seats on which are often given out as political rewards.
Early this month, Mr. Chau was one of more than 400 prominent pro-China figures in Hong Kong summoned to Shenzhen, a city across the border. At the meeting, Chinese officials including the director of the liaison office, who is a member of the party’s Central Committee, said that Beijing wanted its allies in the city to help resist “the turmoil.”
Ten days after the meeting in Shenzhen, Mr. Chau’s Fujian association and other groups that formed the Great Alliance to Protect Hong Kong, a new umbrella organization, responded to Beijing’s calls by holding a counterprotest. Its rally in mid-August drew tens of thousands of people to a park near the headquarters of China’s military garrison.
“It is a massive P.R. exercise to bring people on side,” said Christine Loh, a former government official and the author of “Underground Front,” a book on the party’s methods in Hong Kong.
The pro-China camp had a single, insistent message: The protests must stop.
Most of those taking part in the rally, unlike the young and far more numerous protesters they want silenced, were middle-aged or older. Many waved China’s red national flag.
“I’m not a member of the party but support the party. Without the party there is no new China,” said Song Huiling, 60, a member of the Hong Kong Residents Association of Tianjin, her family’s hometown in northern China. She and her husband, a member of the Fujian association, said they had joined the protest of their own accord.
A clutch of billionaire property moguls also attended. Tycoons, easily induced into the pro-China camp because they want to protect their investments on the mainland, have been the main pillar of China’s support in Hong Kong since the 1980s.
In recent days, many businesspeople have mastered a party-dictated script, issuing statements filled with Communist-style phrases about the need to “resolutely” oppose disorder.
Ta Kung Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper controlled by the party, on Tuesday sent out a shrill call to arms, warning in an editorial that “as terrorism raises its head, only with an iron hand to calm the chaos will there be good times.”
Edmund W. Cheng, a scholar at Hong Kong Baptist University who has studied the party’s operations in the city, said efforts to shift public opinion against the protests have been crimped by widespread distrust of the party. Many nominally independent “patriotic” groups in Hong Kong, for instance, are regarded with suspicion and thought of as front organizations that take orders from Beijing.
Much of this suspicion dates to the colonial period, when the underground party orchestrated a campaign of rioting and bombings in 1967. The violence so revolted the public, already wary of Mao Zedong’s revolution, that even many who considered themselves patriots came to see the Communist Party as sinister and dangerous.
The British authorities stepped up surveillance of China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong, which was the liaison office’s predecessor as party coordinator and Beijing’s de facto consulate, and raided the homes of suspected party members.
In the half-century since, the party has slowly repaired the damage and restarted the work of its United Front, while remaining hidden.
Lee Yee, the 83-year-old founding editor of two magazines focused on Chinese politics, said he had been approached in the 1970s by a covert party member who asked: “Do you really want to stay just an ordinary civilian?”
He declined what he said was a coded invitation to join the underground network.
Sympathetic to the party in his earlier years, Mr. Lee has long crossed paths with undeclared members.
He said that the party’s hidden status allowed its members to pass themselves off as regular residents. If they declared their membership, he said, “other people would be afraid” of them.
Xu Jiatun, a former Xinhua News Agency chief in Hong Kong and its party secretary from 1983 to 1990, wrote in his memoirs that there were more than 6,000 secret party members during his time.
As the handover to China approached, some Chinese officials, including Mr. Xu, recommended that the party break cover after 1997 and compete openly with registered parties. But this idea was quashed amid worries that it would undermine the authority of the post-colonial local government and risk party candidates being crushed in elections.
By choosing continued secrecy, however, the party merely transferred suspicions onto China’s liaison office and prominent pro-China figures that it supports, like Leung Chun-ying, once the city’s top official, who has denied frequent accusations that he is a covert member.
The office was besieged at least once this summer by protesters, who see it as a symbol of the mainland’s hidden influence.
“The United Front has never been very useful in getting real organic support in Hong Kong,” said Samson Yuen, a scholar at Lingnan University who studies Hong Kong social movements.
One big handicap has been its tendency to use furtive tactics that can leave even China’s supporters perturbed.
Patrick Ko, the founder of a patriotic outfit that held a pro-police rally recently, said the liaison office ordered him to drop out of an election for Hong Kong’s legislature in 2016 because he was competing against candidates Beijing favored.
“Of course, I was not happy,” he said at his group’s small, cluttered office in an old warehouse building.
He denied getting support from the liaison office for his group, called Voice of Loving Hong Kong, or having any ties to the party. But Mr. Ko, 66, acknowledged that he had long been a member of a Shenzhen organization affiliated with the party’s United Front Department in Beijing.
All the same, he declined to drop out of the 2016 election, despite what the chairman of his organization, Rex Wong, said was an offer from the liaison office to provide funding to the group if Mr. Ko did not run.
Beijing’s officials, Mr. Wong said, expect China’s supporters in Hong Kong to act like “obedient children.”
“If you want resources,” he said, “you have to listen to the Center, right or wrong.”

Blizzard Sets Off Backlash for Penalizing Hearthstone Gamer in Hong Kong,"The gaming company suspended the player and made him forfeit his prize money after he expressed support for the protest movement in Hong Kong.
HONG KONG — Activision Blizzard became the latest American company to find itself caught between its business interests in China and the values of its core customers after it suspended an e-sports player who voiced support for the Hong Kong protests during a live broadcast.
The decision to suspend Chung Ng Wai, a professional Hearthstone player in Hong Kong, for a year, while forcing him to forfeit a reported $10,000 in prize money, prompted a backlash in the United States similar to the public relations debacle the N.B.A. has faced this week. Gamers posted angrily on social media and in forums, while politicians saw it as another troubling sign of China’s chilling clampdown on speech worldwide.
“Recognize what’s happening here. People who don’t live in #China must either self censor or face dismissal & suspensions,” Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, wrote on Twitter. “China using access to market as leverage to crush free speech globally.”
Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a Democrat, concurred, saying on Twitter that Activision Blizzard showed “it is willing to humiliate itself to please the Chinese Communist Party.”
“No American company should censor calls for freedom to make a quick buck,” he said.
Activision Blizzard, which has created some of the most popular games in e-sports, including Overwatch and StarCraft, said Mr. Chung had run afoul of a rule barring players from any act that “brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages” the company’s image.
In a post-match interview with the Taiwan stream of Hearthstone, Mr. Chung, who is known as Blitzchung, appeared with ballistic goggles and a gas mask, protective gear often worn by protesters during demonstrations in Hong Kong. Mr. Chung shouted in Mandarin: “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times,” a popular slogan of the protesters.
Mr. Chung did not respond to an interview request on Wednesday. But in a chat with fans on Tuesday on Twitch, a live-streaming service, he expressed no regret.
“Today, what I have lost in Hearthstone is four years of time,” he said, referring to the years he spent playing the game. “But if Hong Kong loses, it would be the matter of a lifetime.”
In the second quarter of 2019, Activision Blizzard earned $173 million from the Asia Pacific region, about 12 percent of its $1.4 billion worldwide total revenues.
Blizzard did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.
Several companies have recently apologized after offending Chinese sensitivities, or have pre-emptively self-censored to ensure that they do not lose access to the lucrative Chinese market.
This week, the N.B.A. was forced onto a tightrope after Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted support of the Hong Kong protests. An initial statement from the N.B.A. was widely seen as insufficiently supportive of Mr. Morey, prompting accusations that the league was more interested in its Chinese business interests than supporting free speech.
Last week’s “South Park” episodes mocked Chinese censors and American businesses that compromise their values for the Chinese market, causing the show to be pulled from Chinese platforms.
It was not yet clear what commercial impact the backlash to Blizzard would have, but many of its users reacted strongly. Threads on Reddit forums dedicated to Blizzard games lit up with criticism, while calls to boycott the company or cancel subscriptions spread throughout Twitter.
One person to cancel his World of Warcraft subscription was Mark Kern, who led the team that created the game.
In an interview, Mr. Kern said China was a major source of revenue for the gaming industry, and he knew he was “closing many doors” careerwise by speaking out on Twitter.
But Mr. Kern, who lived in Hong Kong as a teenager, said the company’s actions were “a deterioration of Blizzard values that really broke my heart.”
“It’s one thing to stay out of politics in games, quite another to take harsh, punitive actions designed to appease a government whose values are against what Blizzard has traditionally stood for,” he said.
Patrick Chow, 20, who works at an e-sports stadium in Hong Kong, said he used to play Hearthstone a lot but would immediately stop playing Blizzard games. He said that Mr. Chung had the right to use his influence to help the people of Hong Kong, and that the company shouldn’t have “controlled the player’s freedom of speech.”
“It breaks my impression of Blizzard,” he said.

Protests Put Hong Kong on Collision Course With China’s Communist Party,"HONG KONG — As anti-government demonstrations escalate in Hong Kong, each side is staking out increasingly polarized positions, making it difficult to find a path to compromise between the protesters and China’s ruling Communist Party.
The demonstrations, which began as a fight against a bill that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be extradited to the mainland, have more broadly morphed into a call for free elections, which largely do not exist in China. To Beijing, it would be a direct challenge to the leadership, tantamount to losing control of Hong Kong.
The once peaceful demonstrations have now intensified, coming into conflict with Hong Kong’s reputation for order and efficiency. Protesters on Monday filled the airport, crippling one of the world’s busiest transportation hubs. Demonstrators returned again on Tuesday, with more flights canceled that day.
China is also projecting more power, raising the possibility of more intense and more frequent clashes with the police. An official in Beijing on Monday condemned the actions of the protesters last weekend, casting it as the first signs of “terrorism.” The Chinese police also appeared to conduct large-scale exercises across the border from Hong Kong in Shenzhen, a city on the mainland.
“We are at a crossroads,” said Martin Lee, a democracy advocate and former lawmaker. “The future of Hong Kong — the future of democracy — depends on what’s going to happen in the next few months.”
[Laser pointers and traffic cones: creative ways Hong Kong protesters are organizing]
The unrest is exposing the inherent conflict in the political experiment that began when China reclaimed Hong Kong from Britain in 1997, an ambitious attempt to marry Beijing’s brand of authoritarianism with a bastion of civil liberties.
China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, wants to make Hong Kong more like a mainland city, using economic incentives to buy happiness and propaganda to win loyalty. The protesters, who represent a wide swath of Hong Kong, want a government that looks out for their interests, not just Beijing’s, to help resolve problems like astronomical housing prices and low wages.
The two sides no longer seem to recognize each other’s concerns.
The protesters recently adopted a slogan with pro-independence roots: “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times.” Many say they use it to describe their desire for a political voice. But Beijing has held up the slogan as evidence that the protesters support independence.
The differences started to widen when the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, pushed ahead with an unpopular extradition bill, despite a massive rally in early June that drew one million people. To many protesters, her decision drove home the fundamental shortcomings of a leader who is accountable to Beijing.
Mrs. Lam later suspended the bill but stopped short of formally withdrawing it, infuriating the protesters and drawing them out in greater numbers. In the weeks since, she has refused to make further concessions, including the call for an independent investigation of the police’s handling of the protests.
“They kind of try to rule Hong Kong the way they rule China. That doesn’t really work in an open society,” said Michael C. Davis, a global fellow at the Wilson Center, a think tank in Washington. “In Hong Kong, when you push people, when you repress them, when you ignore them — they push back.”
But the protesters’ challenge to Beijing has also backed the party into a corner. In recent days, protesters have grown more defiant, lighting fires, hurling bricks and gasoline bombs and defacing symbols of Chinese rule.
The party is determined to not look weak in the face of the tumult, which has quickly become the biggest public resistance to the rule of Mr. Xi since he took power in 2012. The Chinese government has made veiled threats of military intervention and accused protesters of plotting a “color revolution” with help from the United States, referring to anti-Communist uprisings it says are orchestrated by the West.
“It is now a ‘life-or-death’ fight for the very future of Hong Kong,” Wang Zhimin, the head of the central government’s office in the city, warned members of Hong Kong’s establishment last week. “There is no room for retreat.”
‘Peaceful Protests Are No Use’
Crystal Yip, a 20-year-old university student, sat peacefully among the demonstrators at the airport on Monday, which prompted the cancellation of more than 150 flights. She is usually at the front lines of street clashes with the police, snuffing out tear gas canisters, building makeshift barricades and providing cover to protesters who hurl bricks.
Millions of people — teachers, construction workers, lawyers, students, and even civil servants — have filled the streets of Hong Kong to protest against the government in a largely peaceful manner. But a small group of young, confrontational protesters like Ms. Yip is using forceful tactics to get a message across to Beijing.
“I know I’m risking my life,” Ms. Yip said. “But I’ve thrown caution to the winds.”
During pro-democracy protests in 2014, Ms. Yip, then a high school student, hovered on the edge of rallies, terrified of standing up to the authorities. But her attitude recently shifted after watching documentaries about the anti-Russian protests in Ukraine in 2014, and about Edward Leung, a pro-independence activist who was sentenced to six years in prison for rioting.
“Peaceful protests are no use,” Ms. Yip said. “If violent resistance can work, then why not use it?”
Ms. Yip and others have embraced more extreme tactics after the failure of Hong Kong’s previous political movements, including the Umbrella Revolution of 2014, to deliver free elections. Their anger has grown as the government has encroached further, removing several pro-democracy lawmakers from office and sentencing protesters to long jail terms.
In that time, Hong Kong’s problems — vast income inequality, a shortage of affordable housing, a dearth of high-paying jobs — have only seemed to worsen.
“I felt so sorry about how we, the Hong Kong people, have been treated,” said Charlie Li, a construction mechanic who was inspired by the persistence of other protesters.
Mr. Li, 35, says he has thrown umbrellas and helmets at police officers. He blames the mainland government for driving protesters toward violence. “They don’t listen to us at all,” Mr. Li said.
The movement reached a turning point in July, when a small group of activists stormed the legislature, smashing glass walls and spray-painting slogans. Since then, the protesters’ list of demands has expanded to include free elections.
Under the current system, a committee of about 1,200 residents, dominated by Beijing’s allies, selects the leader. A small minority of protesters have openly called for Hong Kong’s independence, but most complain of feeling politically powerless.
As China takes a harder line, Hong Kong’s veteran pro-democracy politicians also face a dilemma.
The protests have helped reinvigorate their push. But by continuing to support the younger demonstrators’ more extreme tactics, the camp risks endangering the activists and increasing the chances of repression. More than 700 people have been arrested already, some 150 people last weekend alone.
“The Communist Party does not forget, and it does not forgive,” said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London. “The more successful they are, the more the Chinese government and Xi Jinping feel embarrassed, the higher the price will be.”
Fears of A ‘Color Revolution’
On the mainland, pundits have warned that Hong Kong is on the brink of disaster. State-run newspapers have called on the public to help protect China’s sovereignty. Prominent officials have blamed American diplomats for working as “black hands” intent on fomenting an uprising.
Beijing once worked diligently to keep word of the Hong Kong protests from reaching the mainland, perhaps fearing the unrest could spread. But in recent days, Mr. Xi’s government has led an all-out effort to discredit the protesters.
The sudden shift reflects deepening concern within the party that it is facing a secessionist threat that could undermine Mr. Xi’s hard-line image.
It poses a delicate challenge. Mr. Xi, who has led a broad crackdown on dissent, does not want to be perceived as yielding to the party’s foes. Yet he is likely wary of taking drastic action, such as deploying troops, for fear of a broader fallout.
Such moves could energize his critics, including pro-independence forces in Taiwan, a self-ruling island that China claims as its own. Hong Kong has long served as China’s entree into the global financial system and a symbol of the Communist Party’s ability to work with free-market societies; an overreaction might alienate big companies and imperil the territory’s economy.
“Anything too dramatic is going to be quite a high cost. It will be called Tiananmen 2.0, and they don’t want that kind of reputational hit,” said Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese politics at King’s College London, referring to Beijing’s bloody crackdown on protesters at Tiananmen Square in 1989.
For the moment, Mr. Xi’s strategy appears to be to throw the government’s support behind Mrs. Lam and the police while blaming the United States for sowing strife.
Inside a ballroom at the Wuzhou Guest House in southern China last week, Zhang Xiaoming, Beijing’s top official for Hong Kong, told an audience of 500 politicians and business executives from Hong Kong that the protests “have the clear characteristics of a color revolution,” a reference to uprisings in the former Soviet bloc that Chinese officials believe drew inspiration from the United States.
In a smaller meeting after the remarks, Michael Tien, a pro-establishment lawmaker from Hong Kong concerned by the escalating violence, said he confronted mainland officials. He urged them to consider giving in to some of the protesters’ demands, including the withdrawal of the extradition bill. “We must resolve these issues,” Mr. Tien said he told Mr. Zhang at the meeting, which took place in Shenzhen. Mr. Tien said Mr. Zhang smiled and took a lot of notes but didn’t comment on his proposals.
Mr. Zhang also rejected the protesters’ demands for free elections, saying the Chinese government would not be willing to consider any electoral system that does not allow Beijing to screen a list of candidates, according to Mr. Tien. Anything short of that, Mr. Zhang said, would be as good as giving up control of Hong Kong.
“I just want the central government to be more concerned about how these future generations will think, beyond the current unrest,” said Mr. Tien.
The debate focuses now on whether the “one country, two systems” arrangement can survive in Hong Kong, or whether Beijing will seek to make it “one country, one system.”
Ronny Tong, a pro-establishment member of the executive council, Mrs. Lam’s top advisory body, said he worries that Hong Kong risks losing its special status.
“How do you think Beijing will think now?” he added. “Do you think they will want to give democracy to people when people are insulting their rule?”

Straining Through the Tear Gas,"In Hong Kong, flinching at echoes of China’s ill-fated Tiananmen democracy movement of 1989.
HONG KONG — Across the street that was about to become a battlefield, forces massed on each side tensely adjusted their gas masks, nervously fiddled with their weapons.
The riot police, with pistols at their hips, were ready with tear-gas grenade launchers and guns loaded with rubber bullets. Down the street, young pro-democracy protesters set up barriers to slow the police, and stretched fishing line across the road to trip them.
Both sides wore helmets and gas masks, and both clutched sticks or truncheons. Then the police charged and a sedate neighborhood erupted into a fury of tear gas, flying rocks and Molotov cocktails.
The Hong Kong and Chinese governments have mishandled these protests from the beginning, and both sides are now escalating and becoming increasingly violent. That face-off on the street was a microcosm of a larger standoff between China’s president, Xi Jinping, determined to impose his kind of order, and countless Hong Kongers, equally determined to breathe freely.
My heart is with the protesters. Hong Kongers are highly educated and of course they deserve the right to choose their leaders. China under Xi has been nibbling away at Hong Kong’s autonomy, just as he has been ratcheting up repression at home — so it’s impossible not to be inspired by up to two million brave Hong Kongers marching to gain rights that are taken for granted in so much of the world.
When a small, skinny man in shorts and a tank top stood with his arms outstretched to try to protect protesters from a police officer pointing a gun at them — the scene of an unforgettable photo — how could we not be moved?
But I also feel a sense of foreboding. It’s probably only a matter of time before someone is killed, and that will unleash a new cycle of recrimination, escalation and violence. There are so many parallels to the Tiananmen student democracy movement that I covered in China 30 years ago — and I wonder if Beijing may ultimately deploy troops, perhaps from the paramilitary People’s Armed Police, to crush these protests as well.
As with the 1989 Tiananmen protests, these in Hong Kong are partly about democracy but also about economic frustrations. The average Hong Konger enjoys housing space of only 160 square feet, just a hair bigger than the average New York City parking space.
As in 1989, these protests snowballed because of government mishandling and arrogance. China’s hard line has also deeply antagonized Hong Kongers. Graffiti everywhere denounce “ChiNazi” influence, and people scold me when I refer to the population here with the old, familiar term of “Hong Kong Chinese.” No, people object: We’re not Chinese. Say “Hong Konger.”
Thus one of Xi’s legacies: He has tarnished the word “Chinese.”
Hong Kong’s police have sometimes been restrained, other times heavy handed, firing tear-gas grenades in ways that experts say are dangerous and excessive. The authorities are also accused of using more than 100 Chinese gangsters, known as triads, to do their dirty work and club and disperse protesters.
The Hong Kong chief executive, Carrie Lam, who has all the charisma of a fish in a tank in a Cantonese restaurant, is generally regarded as having bungled the affair from the beginning. Her next step may be to invoke emergency powers — akin to martial law — and crack down further on dissent; this may just backfire and inflame the protests.
On the other side, protesters have also escalated their tactics and become increasingly violent. More and more people — although still a tiny minority of the overall pool of protesters — hurl rocks or Molotov cocktails at the police. Hong Kongers say they have absorbed the lesson that the government pays no attention to purely peaceful demonstrations. I believe the violence is a mistake that increases the risk of a crackdown, but the public frustration is so great that I found few people ready to condemn it.
One more eerie parallel with Tiananmen: Many protesters scoff at the possibility of a military crackdown.
“Western pressure will prevent a Tiananmen from happening here,” a 29-year-old man told me during a march the other day.
A young couple, Charles and Cindy, came out in matching helmets, gas masks and goggles to stand up for democracy, but they told me that Beijing would never use force to crush the protests.
“The free world will support Hong Kong,” Charles told me. And Cindy pointed to Hong Kong’s economic importance to China, adding, “We are still very valuable to them.”
True enough, and people often say that China will never kill the goose that lays golden eggs. But as Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, once dryly noted, that phrase came into existence only because “history is littered with the carcasses of decapitated geese.”
In the run-up to the massacres of 1989, idealistic protesters often told me that their cause was invincible. And then I watched tanks roll over righteousness.

Hong Kong’s Status as Neutral Ground at Risk as China Asserts Power,"In a part of the world familiar with conflict, dislocation and ruthless ideological extremism, Hong Kong has long beckoned as an oasis of stability.
It has prospered on the strength of its proximity to mainland China — close enough to be a base for investors capitalizing on China’s development, and still beyond reach of the authoritarian hand of the Chinese Communist Party.
It has served as a bridge between two rival powers nursing mutual suspicions, the United States and China. It is Chinese territory yet governed by a legal system inherited from the West, and intertwined with the global financial system.
[Read  live updates to China’s National Day parade and Hong Kong protests  .]
But now Hong Kong’s status as neutral ground between mainland China and the outside world is being threatened by a pair of momentous confrontations. As President Trump increases tariffs on Chinese goods in his trade war, the value of Hong Kong as a hub for commerce is being diminished. And as protesters filling Hong Kong’s streets accuse China of breaching a deal that was supposed to protect the territory’s democratic norms, the endurance of its semiautonomous status appears in doubt.
With geopolitical and ideological friction between China and the United States intensifying, some say the space for a place like Hong Kong is disappearing.
“We will see a different Hong Kong,” said Lynette H. Ong, a China expert at the University of Toronto. “The very reason for Hong Kong’s existence — the rule of law, respect for the police, for public institutions, respect for the judiciary, the bureaucracy — everything has been eroded.”
On Sunday, three of Hong Kong’s main commercial districts were engulfed in thick clouds of tear gas as tens of thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators battled the police in some of the territory’s worst unrest since the protests began. A few protesters threw firebombs at the police. Some chanted, “Expel the Communist Party, free Hong Kong!”
The protest was an open challenge to the party just two days before China celebrates 70 years of Communist rule on the mainland. Even larger demonstrations in Hong Kong aimed at upstaging the festivities in Beijing are expected on Tuesday, with fresh clashes with the police likely.
One Country, Two Systems
Twenty-two years ago, as Britain handed its erstwhile colony back to China, cautious optimism prevailed that Hong Kong’s special status would endure. Beijing pledged adherence to a doctrine known as “one country, two systems” and asserted that its “ultimate aim” was universal suffrage to elect the territory’s leader. It promised that Hong Kong’s traditional freedoms would be protected for the next half-century.
Surveys showed that a majority of Hong Kong residents were happy about the handover, which transpired on July 1, 1997. Business leaders exuded confidence that the territory’s rules-based regulation, independent courts and freewheeling press would persist. Hong Kong would return to China, yet retain its status as an open, global metropolis.
“There’s no lack of confidence,” Nellie Fong, a partner in the American accounting firm Arthur Andersen and a member of the incoming government’s cabinet, told The New York Times as the handover approached. “What Hong Kong people regain on July 1 is our own identity.”
The British Empire had seized Hong Kong in 1841 as it pursued retribution for a lopsided balance of trade: Britain was purchasing vast quantities of tea and silk from China, but China was buying little in return. Britain deployed naval power to force China to accept opium shipped from colonial India, capturing the island of Hong Kong as a military and commercial outpost.
Over the next 150 years, Hong Kong was a refuge for Chinese dissidents and those fleeing upheaval in China, especially after the Communists took power in 1949. It became the linchpin of trade between China and the rest of the planet, swelling into the busiest port on earth.
As the handover approached, China was seeking entry to the World Trade Organization, a step it would achieve in 2001, gaining greater access to world markets. China was also preparing its largest state-owned companies to go global. Hong Kong’s impressive port offered a convenient pathway for trade. The banks and trading houses clustered in its gleaming skyscrapers provided a way to secure foreign money.
The optimism about Hong Kong’s future was premised on the notion that China had to respect its ways or risk undermining the value of the territory it was reclaiming.
Beijing also hoped that Hong Kong’s prosperity would validate China’s mode of governance, in which politics are a distraction to economic progress. The party would govern Hong Kong through a loyal elite, while tapping the territory’s capital markets and professional ranks to advance China’s ambitious development plans.
Success in Hong Kong would be leveraged to court reunification with Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as part of its territory.
Some local leaders fretted that their interests were subordinate to Britain’s determination to close the book on its colonial adventures.
“The British did not give Hong Kong people a choice,” said Anson Chan, who was Hong Kong’s chief secretary — the second-highest position in the territory’s government — during and after the handover. “There was a great deal of trepidation. Even among the business sector there was skepticism, because, essentially, you were turning over Hong Kong to a sovereign power whose philosophy, ideology and everything else was so totally different.”
Many Westerners expressed hope, however, that Hong Kong would help change China rather than the other way around, serving as a conduit for free enterprise and democratic ideas. Some maintained that global commerce would prove decisive. “Constructive engagement” would tether Chinese fortunes to world markets, and that would require liberty.
“There is no firewall between economic freedom and freedom in its many other dimensions,” Lawrence H. Summers, who was deputy Treasury secretary, declared in Hong Kong before the handover. “The free flow of information, the ability of people to remain free, to enter into transactions, to speak out: These are all the essential elements of free markets and a strong financial system.”
As Britain’s last governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, officially transferred power back to China, he asserted that the city’s principles were immutable.
“They are universal values,” Mr. Patten said. “They are the values of the future in Asia as elsewhere, a future in which the happiest and the richest communities, and the most confident and the most stable, too, will be those that best combine political liberty and economic freedom as we do today.”
For a time, these competing hopes — those of the party and the West — coexisted in a delicate tug-of-war, allowing Hong Kong to thrive.
Making China Great Again
Xi Jinping had other ideas.
After he ascended in 2013, the new Chinese president delivered a profound change in his country’s engagement with the world. He used China’s growing economic clout as impetus for an increasingly muscular foreign policy.
Under his leadership, China has sought to dominate new markets, projected power around the globe and redoubled the Communist Party’s control of the political sphere. He has crushed dissent while presiding over the mass imprisonment of minority Uighurs in the western region of Xinjiang. He enshrined Xi Jinping Thought as party ideology, scorning democracy and liberalized economics as decadent Western exports.
Mr. Xi’s vigilance against threats to party authority also appears to have altered Beijing’s assessment of Hong Kong. Its commercial value was now discounted by its potential as a hotbed for dangerous free expression and a base of subversion against the party’s rule on the mainland.
“Xi Jinping has tightened his control over Hong Kong,” Sally Chan, 30, an investment bank clerk, said as she marched toward government offices during the demonstrations on Sunday. “The government overlooks the rule of law now. Police brutality is everywhere. We have to be careful not to reveal our identity to the police.”
Hong Kong’s worth also came in for re-examination after the global financial crisis of 2008. Western bankers — some based in Hong Kong — and officials from Washington had long lectured Beijing about the need for China to lift restrictions on the movement of money. But the crisis exposed the deficiencies of the Western system.
“The current leadership under Xi Jinping is far less interested in learning the lessons of capitalism from Hong Kong,” said Rana Mitter, director of Oxford University’s China Center. “Hong Kong is seen as a more anomalous and troublesome place that needs to be sorted out. It’s no longer seen as a golden goose.”
Part of the change reflected the reality that Hong Kong was no longer the primary gateway to China. China was building road and rail networks while modernizing its ports, eliminating the need to ship through Hong Kong. Today, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Ningbo and Guangzhou each handle more container traffic than Hong Kong, according to the World Shipping Council.
By 2009, the dollar value of initial public offerings for state-owned Chinese companies on Shanghai’s stock market was greater than those in Hong Kong, according to Dealogic, a financial data company. “Hong Kong is no longer critical,” said V-nee Yeh, chairman of Cheetah Investment Management. “Shanghai will become the pre-eminent financial center over Hong Kong.”
The trade war threatens to further diminish Hong Kong’s status as a center of commerce. Mr. Trump has exhorted American companies to abandon China and make their products elsewhere. Economists say such talk is overheated. The global economy revolves around two foundational forces — China’s unsurpassed capacity to make things, and Americans’ insatiable appetite for buying things. Yet even a marginal movement of factory production out of China challenges Hong Kong’s place as a financial and logistics center.
Hong Kong’s economy is already contracting amid fears of a full-blown recession. Fitch Ratings downgraded Hong Kong’s credit this month out of concern over China’s increasing role in the city’s affairs. Moody’s followed, asserting that “the ongoing protests reveal an erosion in the strength of Hong Kong’s institutions” and “undermine Hong Kong’s credit fundamentals by damaging its attractiveness as a trade and financial hub.”
In Washington, Mr. Xi’s authoritarian proclivities and global ambitions have silenced talk of constructive engagement with China, replacing it with hawkish warnings of a new Cold War. That has narrowed the space for a neutral Hong Kong. The huge protests of the past three months have worsened the tension. American politicians from both major parties have voiced support for the protesters while Chinese officials have hit back, angrily accusing them of encouraging street violence to block China’s rise.
The demonstrations were initially spurred by anger over a proposed bill that would have enabled criminal suspects to be extradited to the mainland, where justice is opaque. But even after Hong Kong’s chief executive scrapped the bill, the protests endured with a broader goal of democratic representation.
Video footage of police officers attacking demonstrators has enraged the public, provoking accusations that local security forces are acting with no public accountability, like those on the mainland. The police actions have especially alienated younger people, many of whom view Hong Kong as a distinct place and sympathize with calls for independence.
“Everyone is very clear about what China’s system is like,” said Yoyo Chan, a 17-year-old student. “Cruel things can happen there, such as concentration camps, and it’s all frightening. Even before the extradition bill was drafted, a few booksellers in Hong Kong had disappeared into China. In a place like Hong Kong, where we have freedom of speech, we don’t want to lose things integral to us.”
Within the business world, the perception that Beijing has brazenly asserted itself is sowing fears that Hong Kong’s identity as a neutral ground is in danger.
“Hong Kong is a good place for business,” said Trevor Ma, 31, founder of Gethemall, an online clothing store. “But the most important thing is freedom. The atmosphere should not just be one where we’re getting enough money. We should be able to say anything without threat. That’s not the case in Hong Kong right now.”
Mostly, he is galled by the creeping sense that China is trying to subsume Hong Kong.
“Most Hong Kong people don’t want to be integrated with China at all,” he said. “If Hong Kong is not different from China, why would I stay?”
Blurring the Lines
In recent weeks, Beijing has dialed up its propaganda channels, portraying the demonstrators as terrorists who are manipulated by foreigners while broadcasting footage of paramilitary exercises in Shenzhen, with the implication that those forces could be dispatched to Hong Kong.
Most experts assume that Beijing will avoid substantial bloodshed, lest it spook financial markets and worsen China’s economic slowdown. But China can stop well short of unleashing troops and still end Hong Kong’s status as a bridge to the West.
The leadership in Beijing and the demonstrators in Hong Kong are dug in, limiting room for compromise.
During Sunday’s protests in Hong Kong, many participants described a violation of trust, with the crackdown on the demonstrations prompting a basic reassessment of the legitimacy of local authority.
Geography seems to have been reconfigured, with mainland China now closer than ever.
“When we were children, our parents always told us to seek out the police when we are in trouble,” said Stephanie Chung, 21, a student at Open University of Hong Kong. “But having seen the police behave so brutishly has been traumatizing. You wonder if one day they will send us back to the mainland to be prosecuted.”
She was standing near the Bank of China tower in downtown Hong Kong. A Chinese flag fluttered in the sky, as wisps of tear gas drifted in the wind.
“Hong Kong has become more alien to me,” said Vincent Tong, 27, a trader at a local financial firm who was also marching on Sunday. “If we fail this time, Hong Kong will be doomed. I don’t want our way of living to become the same as those living in China.”

"In Hong Kong Protests, Faces Become Weapons","A quest to identify protesters and police officers has people in both groups desperate to protect their anonymity. Some fear a turn toward China-style surveillance.
HONG KONG — The police officers wrestled with Colin Cheung in an unmarked car. They needed his face.
They grabbed his jaw to force his head in front of his iPhone. They slapped his face. They shouted, “Wake up!” They pried open his eyes. It all failed: Mr. Cheung had disabled his phone’s facial-recognition login with a quick button mash as soon as they grabbed him.
As Hong Kong convulses amid weeks of protests, demonstrators and the police have turned identity into a weapon. The authorities are tracking protest leaders online and seeking their phones. Many protesters now cover their faces, and they fear that the police are using cameras and possibly other tools to single out targets for arrest.
And when the police stopped wearing identification badges as the violence escalated, some protesters began to expose officers’ identities online. One fast-growing channel on the social messaging app Telegram seeks and publishes personal information about officers and their families. The channel, “Dadfindboy,” has more than 50,000 subscribers and advocates violence in crude and cartoonish ways. Rival pro-government channels seek to unmask protesters in a similar fashion.
Mr. Cheung, who was arrested last week on a suspicion of “conspiring and abetting murder,” subscribes to the “Dadfindboy” channel, although he denied being among its founders as the police have said and he condemned posts calling for violence. He believes he was targeted by the police because he developed a tool that could compare images against a set of photos of officers to find matches — a project he later abandoned.
“I don’t want them to be like secret police,” said Mr. Cheung, who was released on bail and has not been charged with wrongdoing. “If law enforcement officers don’t wear anything to show their identity, they’ll become corrupt. They’ll be able to do whatever they want.”
“With the tool, ordinary citizens can tell who the police are,” he added.
Hong Kong is at the bleeding edge of a significant change in the authorities’ ability to track dangerous criminals and legitimate political protesters alike — and in their targets’ ability to fight back. Across the border in China, the police often catch people with digital fingerprints gleaned using one of the world’s most invasive surveillance systems. The advent of facial-recognition technology and the rapid expansion of a vast network of cameras and other tracking tools has begun to increase those capabilities substantially.
The transformation strikes a strong chord in Hong Kong. The protests began over a proposed bill that would have allowed the city to extradite criminal suspects to mainland China, where the police and courts ultimately answer to the Communist Party.
The authorities in Hong Kong have outlined strict privacy controls for the use of facial recognition and the collection of other biometric data, although the extent of their efforts is unclear. They also appear to be using other technological methods for tracking protesters. Last month, a 22-year old man was arrested for being the administrator of a Telegram group.
Protesters are responding. On Sunday, as another demonstration turned into a violent confrontation with the police, some of those involved shined laser pointers at police cameras and used spray paint to block the lenses of surveillance cameras in front of the Chinese government’s liaison office. Riot officers carried cameras on poles just behind the front lines as they fired tear gas and rubber bullets.
The protesters’ ire intensified after the police removed identification numbers from their uniforms, presumably to keep violent misconduct from being reported to city leaders. To some protesters, the move suggested the police were taking a cue from the mainland, where officers lack public accountability and often do not identify themselves.
“Why do the police get away while we’re getting attacked?” said Billy Tsui, a hairdresser. “If they do something wrong, they should face legal consequences.” He said that he favored peace over violence but that he also had some sympathy for the Telegram group exposing officers as a check on police misconduct.
“The original intention is just to identify who are the policemen,” Mr. Tsui, 21, said. “If they hide their numbers and don’t show their identity, this is the only way to know.”
Hong Kong police representatives have said personal information about officers and their friends and relatives had been posted online in an act known as doxxing. On July 3, the police said they had arrested eight people accused of, among other things, disclosing personal information without approval. A police spokesman said members of the police force had reported more than 800 incidents in which officers or their family members had been harassed following the data releases.
“Dadfindboy” — a play on the name of a Facebook group created under the auspices of helping mothers find their children, but which ultimately became a way for pro-government groups to gather photos of protesters — is one forum for the doxxing of police officers. By turns facetious, juvenile, cruel and profane in tone, the channel repeatedly reveals personal information and photos, some of them intimate, of the family members of police officers, sometimes with intimate social-media photos.
The channel has featured calls for violence, often in cartoonish ways, although there is no proof that it has incited any specific acts. One post instructed protesters on how to master using a slingshot. Another explained how to make a blow torch using aerosol deodorant. A recent poll queried the channel’s followers about how best to deal with the police. Options included prison, gas chamber, live burial, guillotine, and machine-gun execution. Live burial prevailed with about one-third of the vote.
The police grabbed Mr. Cheung 11 days after the Telegram channel was created, accusing him of administering it. They also accused him of posting a guide on how to assassinate police officers. Mr. Cheung denies the allegations, and a New York Times search could not find posts matching what the police described.
Mr. Cheung, a skinny 29-year-old, was grabbed at a mall around noon on July 18, according to his account. Four plainclothes officers waited for him to unlock his phone and then jumped on him, trying to pry it out of his hands.
After the officers tried to use his face to unlock the phone, they took him to a police station, where, he said, he was roughed up and interrogated. Later, officers went to his home and used a USB drive loaded with hacking software to break into his computers, according to his account of the incident. He said that he had been held for more than 10 hours and that he was not sure how the police had identified him.
Hong Kong police confirmed the investigation, but they declined to comment further on it.
The police may have been motivated by the facial-recognition tool, which Mr. Cheung said he had showed off in a Facebook video he posted last month. Making use of Google technology, Mr. Cheung, a college dropout who studied computer science, built an algorithm to identify police officers based on a small collection of photos that had been posted online. He said he did not continue to pursue the project because of a lack of time.
Mr. Cheung said his detention had cemented his fears. He said the plainclothes officers who arrested him did not identify themselves until they reached the police station. Later, an investigator in a suit urged him to open his phone as a way of demonstrating his innocence “to the 42nd floor” — a phrase Mr. Cheung said seemed to refer to high-ranking police officials. He did not believe that the police ultimately gained access to the phone, although they did break into his other devices.
The police also did not initially allow him to make a call. Only when he said he planned to play Ping-Pong with his uncle did they relent and let him. He said he contacted a friend instead, adding “I hate sports.”
Mr. Cheung also said he believed he had been followed by plainclothes officers since his arrest. When he arrived an hour late to an interview with The Times, he said it was because he was trying to lose a tail. With the help of his black Tesla, he said, he managed to outrace whoever it was on the highways of the New Territories in northern Hong Kong.
“The cops are getting more and more aggressive,” he said. “I don’t think they have permission to unlock my iPhone or any device. They are starting to be out of their mind.”
“I think it’s more possible to see that Hong Kong will become China,” he said.

Hong Kong Protests: How Does This End?,"A bill before Congress would put the United States squarely on the side of the protesters, even as the demonstrations seem to spin out of control.
After nearly six months of escalating protests, Hong Kong is a mess, its reputation for efficiency in tatters, its economy in recession, its roads and rails often blocked. And there is no end in sight.
That poses a quandary for those who admire and support the protest movement, but who recoil at the notion of such a unique and vibrant enclave self-destructing. The difficulty is compounded by the fact that the movement has no leadership, no coordinating committee to advise, to cheer or to warn.
In the end, however, there is no choice for those who cherish freedom but to support the protests, as a bill pending in the United States Congress does. The protests may be counterproductive, destructive, leaderless and even futile, but for these same reasons they are an altruistic, self-sacrificing and genuine demonstration that people who have known freedom, even in a limited form, refuse to surrender it.
It is doubtful that Xi Jinping, the authoritarian Chinese leader, understands the resistance or the longing. Those who rise to the pinnacle of a secretive, authoritarian, coercive system like China’s are molded to believe that you can control all the people all the time, if you can only find the right combination of sticks, carrots, lies and information filters. To them, any dissent must be a political plot hatched in dark foreign corners.
What Mr. Xi does instinctively understand is the threat posed by Hong Kong while he is waging a global propaganda offensive, backed by the lure of China’s enormous market. A Tiananmen-style crackdown, he knows, would be disastrous for China’s standing and image. But letting the protesters have their way, he believes, would show weakness and potentially encourage repressed minorities in China, such as the Uighurs, Kazakhs or Tibetans, to push for their rights.
Lacking any means for winning the Hong Kongers’ hearts or minds and unable to give in to their demands, leaders in Beijing and their loyalists in Hong Kong, including the administration led by Carrie Lam, see no alternative to exerting ever greater police force. And that serves only to further inflame the demonstrators.
Foreign governments, too, confront a dilemma. On the commercial side, overt support for the protests could lead to a loss of Chinese business. President Trump, for one, has stayed largely silent on the latest protests, even while grappling with Mr. Xi on trade, evidently seeking not to trammel the chance of a deal. There is also the problem of supporting demonstrations in which protesters have sometimes resorted to violence, even if police violence has been far greater and more systematic. Nothing justifies setting an opponent on fire, as one protester apparently did.
These incidents of violence must be noted and condemned. But they are inevitable in confrontations with police that have been escalating over many weeks. One thing remains incontestable: In this protracted and painful confrontation, the people of Hong Kong hold the moral high ground in their determination to decide their own fate and to reject the animal farm that China would put them in even before the transition to full Chinese control in 2047, the date established in the agreement that ended Britain’s control over its former colony.
There is no way to predict how long the protests will continue, or what will be their outcome. But the people of Hong Kong deserve support, and Mr. Xi should be left with no doubt that violent intervention will carry an immediate and heavy price.
The bill before Congress, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which accuses the Chinese government of creating more chaos and warns of new sanctions, has the support of both parties, and should be brought to a vote without further delay. Painful as it is to observe, this is a struggle that the free world must support.

"As Hong Kong Firms Fall in Line Over Protests, Some Workers Push Back","China is putting pressure on businesses to denounce the demonstrations. “They are trying to silence everyone,” an accountant said.
HONG KONG — As big companies in Hong Kong squirm under pressure to denounce the continuing antigovernment protests in the territory or risk angering China, some of their employees are speaking out, raising the prospect of escalating labor tensions in the Asian financial capital.
On Friday, more than 1,000 people joined a march for accountants in Hong Kong’s financial district, some of them wearing surgical masks to hide their faces from their employers. They called on the Hong Kong government to answer protesters’ demands, even as the so-called Big Four global accounting firms that employ many of them have sought to distance themselves from the unrest.
Trade union representatives also held a news conference on Friday to demand that Cathay Pacific Airways, Hong Kong’s flagship carrier, reinstate the head of a flight attendants’ union who they said was fired without explanation this week.
Pressure from the Chinese authorities over some Cathay employees’ support for the demonstrations has already led this month to the resignation of the airline’s chief executive, Rupert Hogg.
“They are trying to silence everyone,” said Ada Wong, a 30-year-old accountant at Friday’s march, which was held over the lunch hour. “But if we don’t speak out, I’m afraid that Hong Kong will be no more.”
She said lashing out at major companies in Hong Kong would ultimately be self-defeating for China. “Our financial and business sector is important to them, so if they hurt us, they will be hurting themselves, too,” Ms. Wong said.
Decades ago, Hong Kong became a global hub of finance and commerce in part because of its proximity to mainland China, and also because the local authorities offered a hands-off approach to business.
But the mainland has grown much richer since then, and it now wields considerable influence over Hong Kong’s business environment. Mainland China now accounts for half of Hong Kong’s trade, and it provides about a quarter of all direct foreign investment in the territory.
As this summer’s protests continue to boil with no sign of resolution, China has begun to weaponize its clout to keep the business community on its side. So far, no company has suffered more consequences than Cathay Pacific, one of Hong Kong’s most storied global brands.
After many Cathay workers took part in a general strike this month, China’s aviation authority ordered the airline to bar employees who supported the protests from doing any work involving flights to mainland China. Mr. Hogg, Cathay’s chief executive, stepped down a week later, saying in a message to employees that the airline’s brand had come under enormous pressure, “particularly in the all-important market of mainland China.”
On Friday, the chairwoman of the Hong Kong Dragon Airlines Flight Attendants’ Association, Rebecca Sy, said at a news conference that she had been fired this week. Hong Kong Dragon Airlines, also known as Cathay Dragon, is a unit of Cathay Pacific.
“We have never abandoned our company,” Ms. Sy said. “Unfortunately, however, the company has abandoned me.”
Ms. Sy said she was summoned this week to meet with Cathay representatives in Hong Kong. During the meeting, she said, the representatives showed her screenshots of posts from her private Facebook account and asked whether the account was hers.
After she said it was, the representatives told her that she was fired immediately, and that they could not tell her why, Ms. Sy said.
She acknowledged after the news conference that she had urged her friends on Facebook to attend recent protests at Hong Kong’s airport, and that she had shared articles and other material supporting the demonstrators.
“All my colleagues are terrified,” Ms. Sy said at the news conference. “I used to be the one to stand behind them, to back up all of my colleagues. But now, what I can do is to tell everyone what’s happening.”
In a statement, Cathay confirmed that Ms. Sy no longer worked for the company, and said that her departure was not connected to her work with the union. It is against the law in Hong Kong to fire an employee because of union activity.
Cathay said in the statement that “when deciding whether to terminate an employee, we take into account all relevant circumstances including applicable regulatory requirements and the employee’s ability to perform his/her job.”
A pro-democracy lawmaker, Andrew Wan, said that for Cathay to fire an employee for expressing personal opinions “can be counted as ‘unreasonable dismissal,’ which is illegal under the current labor ordinance.”
Carol Ng, the chairwoman of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, said at the news conference that 11 people in Hong Kong’s aviation industry had been fired since the Chinese aviation regulator issued its orders to Cathay this month.
The pressure “doesn’t mean we will shut up,” Ms. Ng said.
At the accountants’ march, people wove through luxury shopping malls and elevated walkways on their way to the Hong Kong government’s headquarters. Organizers said 5,000 people joined the march.
Several people in surgical masks said they were employees of the Big Four accounting firms — PwC, Deloitte, KPMG and Ernst & Young, now known as EY. That, they said, is why they were not willing to be interviewed.
Last week, those firms issued statements distancing themselves from a full-page ad supporting the protests that appeared in a Hong Kong newspaper. The ad was apparently signed and paid for by a group of anonymous employees of the companies.
Some of the marchers Friday wore the black T-shirts that have become the uniform of the summer’s protests. Others came dressed for the office.
“There is definitely a possibility that there will be consequences,” said Cherry Wong, 49, an independent financial adviser. “But as industry leaders, I think that the Big Four should stand firm on the side of Hong Kong people on this issue.”
Representatives for PwC and EY referred to earlier statements from the companies that condemned violence and illegal acts. The other two firms did not respond to requests for comment.
Kenneth Leung, a tax adviser and pro-democracy member of Hong Kong’s legislature who joined the accountants’ march, said that putting pressure on firms to speak out against the protests jeopardized the territory’s reputation as a business-friendly place.
“Hong Kong should be the freest economy, meaning that it should not be disturbed by pressure from governments,” Mr. Leung said. “We should be rational and leave business to business.”

What the Hong Kong Protests Are Really About,"When hundreds of thousands of my fellow Hong Kongers took to the streets to demonstrate last month, most of the world saw people protesting provocative legislation that would allow extraditions to mainland China.
But the Chinese government, which supported the extradition measure, had a much broader view of the protests. It recognized them as the first salvo in a new cold war, one in which the otherwise unarmed Hong Kong people wield the most powerful weapon in the fight against the Chinese Communist Party: moral force.
In much of the West, moral force is underestimated. Communists never make that mistake. There is a reason Beijing will never invite the pope or the Dalai Lama for a visit to China. The government knows that whenever its leaders must stand beside anyone with even the slightest moral legitimacy, they suffer by the comparison. Moral force makes Communists insecure.
And for good reason. As China was reminded this week, as riot police officers used pepper spray and batons on demonstrators in Hong Kong, the protests have been holding a mirror up to China. What rattles Beijing is that it sees in that mirror what the rest of the world sees: a monster.
Since his ascendancy to power in 2012, President Xi Jinping has made no secret of his goal to purge the Western influences that he believes are contaminating China. In Hong Kong, he has been working to erode the limited political freedoms and rule of law that make Hong Kong the special region of China that it is — and that have long made Hong Kong economically valuable to China, ironically enough.
Nearly all us in Hong Kong who are Chinese are refugees or the descendants of refugees from China. We have no illusions about what happens to people when they come up short in the eyes of the Communist Party. Everyone in Hong Kong knows that introducing the possibility of imprisoning us in China, as the extradition treaty does, would signal the end of life in Hong Kong as we know it.
In Beijing’s view, of course, Hong Kong’s colonial past undermines its legitimacy as a Chinese society. Never mind that the system of limited freedoms that the British introduced to Hong Kong existed long before Communism was established on the mainland. (Communism is itself a Western import to China, by the way.)
The inconvenient truth is that Chinese people in Hong Kong (and in Taiwan) live better than any Chinese in Chinese history. This gives moral force to our way of life. It also shows the extraordinary things Chinese people can accomplish when given the freedom to do so.
Hong Kong’s moral force has also been economically good for China, since the moral force of our free society cannot be separated from its prosperity. It is not likely that Beijing agreed to have the government of Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, suspend consideration of the extradition bill just because a lot of people marched against it. No doubt President Xi learned much about capital flight and jittery investors during those protests and saw how badly China still needs a prosperous and functioning Hong Kong.
This is Mr. Xi’s great weakness: If he crushes the soul of Hong Kong, he will lose the Hong Kong he needs to make China the global power he envisions.
So it is not trade with China that the West should aim to stop. China is also simply too big now as a market for and producer of goods and services. We all need to trade with China, just as we all need to trade among ourselves. It should be possible for the West and China to trade freely, while at the same time competing as opposing value systems.
The values war is the real war. For the West to prevail, it must support the tiny little corner of China where its virtues now operate: Hong Kong. These values may be a legacy of Western rule, but for Hong Kongers who have grown up with them, they feel as natural as any part of our Chinese heritage.
Our struggle with Beijing, if successful, can help China’s leaders begin to accept the need for authority earned through the moral admiration of the world, not through the barrel of a gun. But if Beijing’s approach prevails, when China becomes the world’s biggest economy — which it inevitably will — the West will face a far greater monster.
The West’s moral authority is its most powerful weapon. Moral authority is where China is most vulnerable to humiliation, at home and abroad. Beijing has no weapons save for force, which gets harder to rely on, the more the world can see that for itself.

A Hong Kong ‘Troublemaker’ With a Clean Conscience,"HONG KONG — He has been mocked for years in China’s state-controlled news media for being fat, which he isn’t, and denounced more recently as a C.I.A. agent, a “black hand” and a member of an American-directed “gang of four” supposedly responsible for orchestrating the Hong Kong protest movement that is now in its 12th week. He says he isn’t any of those things, either.
This week the object of all that opprobrium, Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong media tycoon, rose in Chinese propaganda from the number three spot in the “gang of four” to its senior member.
That China has put much so much energy into demonizing a 71-year-old man is a measure of Mr. Lai’s singular status as the one prominent businessman in Hong Kong who openly supports antigovernment protests, routinely denounces the Communist Party leader Xi Jinping as a “dictator” and refuses to follow fellow tycoons in paying at least token obeisance to Beijing.
China’s relentless campaign of vilification against Mr. Lai took a particularly nasty turn last week when his name was purged from the genealogical records of his family across the border in southern China.
His relatives, according to a report in Ta Kung Pao, a Communist Party-controlled newspaper in Hong Kong that invariably refers to him as “fatty Lai,” deleted his name from a family tree going back 28 generations, declaring him a “traitor” to his ancestors and his country who is no longer part of the clan.
In an interview over a light Chinese lunch of shrimp and chicken in a glassed-in veranda at his home, Mr. Lai said the same relatives used to visit him regularly and have for years received money that he sent to them, but “of course they are going to deny me now.”
The Chinese authorities, for all their talk about the primacy of family in Chinese culture, he added, frequently hound families to put pressure on critics. “They are very good at frightening people,” he said.
As the majority owner of Next Media Group, which publishes Next, a weekly magazine, and Apple Daily, a popular newspaper and website, Mr. Lai has provided a powerful, wide-reaching platform to the mostly young and leaderless protesters. Both also have separate editions published in Taiwan.
Apple Daily, once a lowbrow rag that ran prostitute reviews, has evolved into a more serious, though still rambunctious, journal of political and social news with a decidedly antigovernment and anti-Beijing slant. It also publishes a weekly column by Mr. Lai that has cheered on the protesters.
His weekly, Next, which began as a print magazine but now has only a digital edition, writes a lot about celebrities and covers local tittle-tattle, but also provides unstinting support for the protests.
The Chinese Communist Party, which controls two newspapers in the city, has squeezed the revenue of both Mr. Lai’s publications by pressuring companies not to advertise. Not a single Hong Kong company now advertises in his newspaper, despite it being the second best selling daily in the city.
The flight of advertisers, he said, has meant a loss of print revenue of about $44 million a year. But the online version of the paper, now behind a partial paywall, earns money from subscriptions and foreign advertisers who are not worried about being blackballed by Beijing.
While all the other prominent tycoons in Hong Kong have stayed silent about the protests or issued statements filled with Communist-style jargon about the need to “resolutely stop the turmoil,” Mr. Lai has not only supported the protesters but joined them. He marched last Sunday in a mass parade through the center of Hong Kong that drew over a million people.
“The establishment hates my guts. They ask, ‘Why don’t you just let us make money in peace?’ They think I’m a troublemaker,” he said, adding: “I am a troublemaker, but one with a good conscience.”
He has caused further anger by cheering on President Trump, whom he describes as “the only one who plays hardball with China. This is the only thing that China understands.”
This is a common view, too, among Chinese dissidents on the mainland, who see Mr. Trump, despite his describing Mr. Xi as “my good friend,” as the first United States leader to see China clearly since President Nixon visited Beijing in 1972 and began what they see as decades of weak-kneed policy.
Mr. Lai’s keen interest in China, however, is one area in which his views diverge sharply from those of Hong Kong’s mostly youthful protesters, who often want nothing to do with the country that took back control of their city from British colonial rule in 1997.
“I always feel Chinese because I belong to the older generation,” he said. Each year he takes part in a candlelight vigil held on June 4 to commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing. Most Hong Kong student groups view Hong Kong as a place apart from China, and stay away from the event.
Born across the border in Canton, the capital of Guangdong, Mr. Lai fled to Hong Kong in a boat as a boy and, until the Tiananmen killings, was a typical success story in the then British-ruled city. He stayed away from politics and diligently worked his way up from lowly jobs as a knitter and clerk to become the main owner of Giordano, a successful chain of clothing stores.
The 1989 Tiananmen bloodshed, he said, made him start thinking about politics and led to his setting up Next Magazine the following year, a move that quickly hurt his clothing business once he started writing insulting articles about leaders in Beijing, particularly China’s then prime minister, Li Peng, widely known as the “Butcher of Beijing,” who died last month at 90.
“I had always hoped that China was changing and would become a democracy. I was wrong. It was wishful thinking,” he said.
In retaliation, the Chinese authorities began closing his Giordano clothing stores on the mainland, his chain’s fastest growing market. He realized that he had to either sell up or mind his tongue. He sold everything but his media holdings for nearly $320 million.
That experience, he said, has helped him understand why so many of his fellow tycoons toe Beijing’s line. “As a businessman, you can’t confront the regime,” he said.
Many business people, he says, do not believe their own statements against the protesters, but feel they have no choice but to show support for the Hong Kong government and Beijing.
This, he said, is understandable but also a mistake because China’s leaders “know that once they cow you, they can always cow you. Once they have you in their pocket they will always squeeze you.”
For Mr. Lai, unlike the other tycoons, the protests are potentially a commercial boon. Apple Daily has been running advertisements that try to lure new digital subscribers by promising them that of every 3 Hong Kong dollars (about 40 cents) they pay for a daily subscription, it will donate 1 Hong Kong dollar to the protest movement.
Mr. Lai has become such a bogeyman for China’s propaganda machine that one newspaper has a photographer and video cameraman on permanent duty on the street outside his colonial-era house on the Kowloon Peninsula to record all his visitors — and, it apparently hopes, find evidence of secret contacts with American intelligence.
A group of mysterious “patriots” also gather regularly outside his front gate, arriving together in a white minibus to wave banners denouncing Mr. Lai, a father of six, as an “American running dog” and “the black financier supporting the turmoil.” He has given modest donations but his main support has been the unswervingly favorable coverage provided by his media outlets.
To put pressure on him through his children, one pro-Beijing newspaper recently published the name and address of a Hong Kong restaurant owned by an older son and urged a boycott. Business increased.
Mr. Lai said he stopped paying attention long ago to all the insults, though he doesn’t enjoy being disturbed by raucous renditions of the Chinese national anthem on his doorstep. The abuse has scared off some old friends, but, he said, “If you don’t fight, you get frightened. I have always been a fighter.”
Photographed whenever he leaves his home and often followed, Mr. Lai shrugged off the harassment as an annoyance that he has grown used to. “I don’t go out much.”

Hong Kong Protesters’ New Target: A News Station Seen as China’s Friend,"HONG KONG — As a television journalist was trying to record video of a protest in Hong Kong last week, the protest suddenly became about him — and his employer.
Surrounding him, the young demonstrators waved signs in front of his camera that read “Change channels!” They also held up bottles of Pocari Sweat, a sports drink that has become an unlikely symbol of disdain for his news station, Television Broadcasts, better known as TVB.
TVB, Hong Kong’s dominant broadcaster, has been singled out for scorn by protesters, who accuse it of a pro-Beijing bias in its coverage of the political crisis roiling this semiautonomous Chinese region.
Analysts say TVB’s reporting has largely focused on how the protests have disrupted Hong Kong’s famed efficiency, while playing down the political frustrations that have driven people to the streets in large numbers.
The tension between the demonstrators and the station, whose broadcasts reach about 70 percent of Hong Kong’s population, touches on concerns that the city’s status as a regional bastion for press freedom is being steadily undermined by the Communist Party in China, where media controls are strict.
“It is a notorious television station and it always doesn’t show comprehensive facts,” said Cheuk Ka-ho, 21, a university student who is active in the protest movement. “We feel that over the years it has gotten worse as it keeps getting closer to China.”
The protests began in early June, when hundreds of thousands marched against legislation that would allow extradition to the Chinese mainland. Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has since suspended the bill indefinitely, but protesters, including on Sunday, have continued to demand its full withdrawal, Mrs. Lam’s resignation and an independent inquiry into what they consider a brutal police response to some of the protests.
On July 1, some demonstrators escalated the conflict by storming, vandalizing and briefly occupying the Hong Kong legislature.
[A New York Times visual investigation suggests the police used excessive force in handling a previous protest.]
In TVB, protesters have found another front in their battle for Hong Kong’s future. They have organized boycotts of the network on social media and lobbied companies to withdraw advertisements from it.
The confrontation on Wednesday, when the TVB journalist was surrounded, was not an isolated incident. Last month, protesters heckled another TVB video journalist, unfurling umbrellas to block his camera and chanting, “TVB news, selling out the people of Hong Kong!”
The protesters accuse the broadcaster, which has a virtual monopoly on free-to-air TV rights in Hong Kong, and a senior executive who was once a top Communist Party official in Shanghai of deliberately marginalizing their movement, a charge that TVB rejects.
A Facebook group calling for boycotts of TVB has drawn more than 30,000 followers, and a petition criticizing the station has collected 100,000 signatures. Last week, the maker of Pocari Sweat, a Japanese sports drink popular in Hong Kong, pulled its advertising from TVB.
TVB has defended its coverage as accurate and impartial and accused protesters of threatening its advertising clients.
“Pocari Sweat’s comments are designed to please protesters, which equals to bowing to violence,” the broadcaster said to a Chinese nationalist tabloid, Global Times, in comments that TVB verified as accurate.
A spokeswoman for TVB declined an interview request. But in a statement last month, the station said it was deeply regrettable that TVB reporters had been prevented from doing their jobs.
Hong Kong’s media landscape has become something of a battleground for the social divisions exposed by the political crisis, which could widen as the mass protests continue.
On one side is, essentially, TVB’s core demographic: older, conservative Hong Kong residents, who tend to sympathize with the police and see the protesters as troublemakers. At a rally in support of the police in late June, some demonstrators assaulted journalists from other local news outlets.
On the other side is a younger group, generally supportive of the protest movement and the pro-democracy politicians who are a minority in the local legislature. For them, TVB’s coverage confirms longstanding fears about Beijing’s growing influence over local affairs.
Some critics refer to TVB as “CCTV-B,” a mocking reference to China Central Television, Beijing’s main broadcaster of domestic propaganda. They point to TVB’s vice chairman, Li Ruigang, a media mogul from mainland China and one-time senior Communist Party official in Shanghai, as evidence of Beijing’s sway over the station. (Mr. Li’s company, China Media Capital Group, did not respond to a request for comment, but he has previously rejected such suggestions.)
The Hong Kong Journalists Association reported last year that mainland Chinese interests had direct control over, or stakes in, nine of Hong Kong’s 26 mainstream media companies, including TVB, up from eight a year earlier.
“Even though ownership is not concentrated in just a few hands, most of them have the same boss: the Communist Party,” Allan Au, a former TVB journalist who is now a media studies expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said of the city’s pro-establishment media barons.
Ever since Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese control in 1997, under a formula known as “one country, two systems” that promised a high degree of autonomy from Beijing, the city has distinguished itself from the mainland partly by nurturing the independence of its institutions, including the news media.
While the encroachment of Chinese interests has raised concerns, Hong Kong’s media landscape, to be sure, is still relatively free. Its journalists are among Asia’s most combative, known to shout sharply worded questions at top city officials. Journalist groups have publicly opposed the extradition bill and accused the police of using excessive force against reporters who were covering protests.
TVB, for its part, has been less overtly antagonistic toward the protest movement than the city’s two pro-Beijing newspapers, Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung Pao. But compared to news outlets with a pro-democracy bent, like the newspaper Apple Daily and the online platform Stand News, it has generally been skeptical of the protesters.
The network “focuses very much on disruptive behavior rather than on what they asked for, what they really want and what’s behind that motivation,” said Gary Tang, a media studies expert at Hang Seng University in Hong Kong, referring to the protesters.
Critics note that TVB was the television outlet Mrs. Lam chose for an interview last month in which she compared dealing with the protesters to her own experience as a mother with a willful child — an analogy that enraged many of the demonstrators. On July 2, when TVB covered the aftermath of the storming of the legislature, it focused on the damage to the building and, unlike other news outlets, barely discussed the protesters’ demands.
Mr. Au said TVB’s closeness to mainland China was evident in the amount of airtime it devoted to reports about, for instance, President Xi Jinping’s so-called Belt and Road Initiative of international trade and infrastructure links, at the expense of other types of reporting.
“This is by design: The serious reporters don’t have enough resources and time to devote to serious journalism,” Mr. Au said. “This is what I call ‘structural censorship’ that confines the content without explicit censorship.”
Privately, some of the network’s reporters and former staff members say they have felt caught in the middle. They are sympathetic to the protesters but resent being targeted over coverage decisions they say were made by their superiors.
“Protesters accuse TVB of brainwashing its loyal audience,” said Lam Yin-bong, a former TVB reporter who now works for Stand News. “But these reporters and cameramen think: ‘First, I’m on your side, and second, even if I’m not, I’m just doing my work in a professional manner.’”
“They would think: ‘This is not my fault, so why are you targeting me?’” he said.

‘Big Brother’ in the Sky: Cathay Pacific Workers Feel China’s Pressure,"Calling it “the white terror,” employees describe a culture of fear as managers fire some who have made social media posts supporting Hong Kong’s protests.
HONG KONG — Mixe Lee’s bosses showed him two Facebook posts. One criticized the police for how they handled the antigovernment demonstrations that have rocked the city of Hong Kong since June. Their question for Mr. Lee, a Cathay Pacific Airways flight attendant: Did he write them?
Mr. Lee denied it, though he had. Then last Thursday, a week after the interrogation, he joined the ranks of those fired by Cathay Pacific after expressing political views that could anger the Chinese government.
“I had never thought that the company would pick on my political orientation,” said Mr. Lee, 30, who had worked at the carrier’s Cathay Dragon regional airline for three and a half years.
Cathay Pacific is fighting for its survival, and its employees risk becoming collateral damage. The Hong Kong-based airline is perhaps the most vulnerable of the global businesses caught between the city’s pro-democracy protesters and a Chinese government that has labeled them violent radicals. China wants the business world to take its side, and it is threatening to withhold access to its big and growing market from companies that don’t.
Beijing has threatened to close off Chinese airspace to Cathay unless it contains its employees. But many of Cathay’s 26,000 Hong Kong-based employees sympathize with the protesters.
The result is what many in Cathay call “the white terror,” a name that harks back to Taiwan’s bloody anti-Communist crackdown in past decades. Nearly two dozen current and former employees described an atmosphere of fear. Many are deactivating their social media accounts, or changing the photos on their profiles so that their managers won’t recognize them.
“You can feel the distance between colleagues,” said Jack Tung, a 32-year-old Cathay Pacific purser who also serves as a first aid provider during Hong Kong’s protests. “I can’t trust those whom I don’t know because I’m not sure whether they would report me to management. It’s like a ‘the Big Brother is watching you’ scenario, especially when you are in the air.”
Those who fly to China say they face even more scrutiny from Chinese air officials, who comb planes after they land for foreign publications that cover the protests and put employees through onerous screening.
It is not clear how many employees have been fired or suspended. Cathay Pacific did not respond to several requests for comment. In previous statements, it condemned violent protests, expressed support for Hong Kong’s government and police force and said it had no choice but to comply with Chinese safety directives.
“We have been Hong Kong’s home carrier for many decades,” a recent statement said. “This is our home. We have grown with this great city and are committed to remaining at the heart of its future growth and success.”
On Wednesday, citing a drop in August traffic, Cathay said it would trim its growth plans. In a memo to employees reviewed by The New York Times, it also announced a hiring freeze.
The problems could continue. While city leaders have canceled a bill that would have allowed extraditions of people suspected of crimes to the mainland, a catalyst for the protests, they have continued over other problems.
Hong Kong’s protests and Beijing’s growing willingness to intercede in the city’s affairs could profoundly change how people work and do business in the Asian financial capital. Cathay, for example, is controlled by Swire Pacific, one of a handful of conglomerates that can trace their history to Hong Kong’s early British colonial era, and have long been dominated by non-Chinese executives. Because it depends so much on business in China, it faces growing pressure to show its loyalty.
“If they want to gain better access to the Chinese market to do business better and easier, foreign companies want to satisfy the nationalistic preferences to the extent they can,” said Zhiwu Chen, a professor of economics at the University of Hong Kong. “Given that background, native Chinese executives are more likely to develop better personal connections on the mainland, either with officials or with other business executives.”
Last month, as Beijing piled pressure on the airline, the company named Augustus Tang, a 60-year-old longtime Cathay and Swire employee, as its new chief executive, replacing Rupert Hogg, the British-born executive who had led the company for only two years.
Cathay also sent a strong message to employees that public support for the protests would not be tolerated. Managers recirculated company guidelines that call for workers to blow the whistle on one another. It fired a pilot who had been arrested during a protest and fired two staff members who were accused of leaking the personal travel details of Hong Kong police officers who were traveling to the mainland for a soccer event, a disclosure that angered Chinese media amid doxxing accusations on both sides.
Tensions worsened in recent days after three flights originating in Hong Kong were found to be carrying depleted oxygen bottles, which would be used by cabin crews if a plane depressurized, raising questions in local news media over whether sabotage was the cause. Cathay said it had suspended the cabin crews involved and was investigating the incidents.
Cathay has not always had smooth relations with its employees. In 2012 and 2015 it narrowly avoided strikes by flight attendants over pay, and just last year it said it would abandon a widely loathed skirts-only policy for female members of cabin crews.
But current and former employees describe what had once been a more open and collegial workplace. Employees were encouraged to admit mistakes with minimal fear of retribution so they could discuss ways to improve their performance. Flight crews openly discussed politics and other sensitive issues.
“The company used to teach us about teamwork,” said Katherine Sin, a 36-year-old flight attendant for nine years. “Our motto was ‘People. They make an airline.’ But now everyone is stabbing other people in the back.”
Ms. Sin said Cathay managers had called her into their offices at Cathay City, the company’s glassy complex near Hong Kong’s airport, two weeks after Mr. Hogg’s resignation. They showed her screenshots of her Facebook and Instagram accounts criticizing the police, including one that said, “If at this point you still support the government and the police, I don’t think you can call yourself a human.” All the posts were made before Mr. Hogg resigned, she said.
Ms. Sin denied the accounts were hers, though they were. She believed that she would be immediately fired if she admitted to them, she said, and that she had not violated company policy. She was fired last Thursday.
“I dedicated myself to the company,” Ms. Sin said. “I loved my company. I used to say proudly to other people that I was a stewardess from Cathay Pacific. But now I can’t say that anymore. I’m too heartbroken.”
Employees have also been questioned about what they wrote more privately.
Joi Lam, a 36-year-old flight purser at Cathay Pacific for 12 years, said she was summoned to an urgent management meeting on Aug. 30. Managers showed her two screenshots from a private WhatsApp group she had created for colleagues who were also mothers, in which she suggested buying helmets, face masks, food and other supplies for the protesters.
Like the other employees interviewed by The Times, she initially denied the posts were hers. She was later fired.
“I feel I was just an employee reference number to the company,” said Ms. Lam, who believes another employee in the WhatsApp group showed her posts to management. “They can delete whoever they want from the system without hesitation.”
Flight crews who travel to China face even more scrutiny from local regulators, several employees said, though they noted that the attention had eased in recent days. Some workers described longer-than-normal flight delays at Chinese airports and regulators searching cabins for periodicals that cover the protests. Others have had to go through searches by security officials, even for those who had to fly out again.
Several Cathay employees asked for anonymity for fear of reprisal. Many employees said they would have a difficult time finding similar jobs elsewhere. Departing workers would have to take their chances with a foreign airline, a regional airline or one of China’s state-run carriers.
Mr. Tung, the purser, did not ask for anonymity. He said he expected to be fired for talking publicly about Cathay’s problems. The risk, he said, was worth it.
“I hope that by making public what’s happening to the company, I can protect my colleagues,” Mr. Tung said. “If I don’t have the right to talk freely, then what use is this job?”

China’s Soft-Power Failure: Condemning Hong Kong’s Protests,"Beijing wants greater sway over global public opinion. Instead, its propaganda outlets make Chinese leaders look like bullies.
Images of masked thugs massing in Hong Kong’s streets. Unproven allegations that protesters are being led by the C.I.A. Comparisons between activists and Nazis.
As protests continue to roil Hong Kong’s streets, China’s state-led propaganda machine has gone into overdrive to persuade the world that radical Hong Kong protesters have put the city in peril. Through social media and other digital arenas, English-language messages from China have painted a picture of a tiny minority of foreign-influenced ruffians intimidating a silent majority of law-and-order residents.
But instead of making China’s case, Beijing’s ham-handed international efforts have largely failed to sway world public opinion. They took a further blow on Monday, when Facebook and Twitter removed hundreds of accounts that they said appeared to be state-backed efforts to sow misinformation and discord in Hong Kong.
Perhaps more significantly, Twitter took the further step of forbidding state-run media outlets from paying to get their tweets promoted so that they appear prominently in users’ timelines. Chinese state-run outlets like the English-language China Daily newspaper and Xinhua, the official news agency, have used promoted tweets to put their own spin on Hong Kong’s turmoil.
Call it a failure of Chinese “soft power” — what the political scientist Joseph S. Nye Jr., who coined the term, defined as getting others to want what you want. China wants soft power but, judging by Beijing’s propaganda, doesn’t know how to get it.
The contrast has been stark. On Sunday, hundreds of thousands of peaceful demonstrators clogged the city streets to call once again for the city’s leaders to give in to their demands and give the people greater say in a political system controlled by Beijing. The protesters — organizers put their number at 1.7 million — offered a more sympathetic narrative than the world saw the week before, when violent clashes broke out in protests at Hong Kong’s airport.
Chinese state media, on the other hand, in recent days has shown images of Chinese paramilitary police across the border in the mainland engaged in crowd-clearing exercises. The Twitter account of Global Times, a nationalist tabloid controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, posted a video on Monday calling four pro-democracy Hong Kong figures “The Gang of Four,” a term that refers to the former Chinese leaders who were blamed for plunging the country into the disastrous Cultural Revolution. (The tweet has since disappeared.)
Pro-China activists also appeared in Australia, Canada and Europe, putting on less-than-wholesome displays. In Toronto on Sunday, pro-mainland protesters shouted words like “traitor” and “loser” as well as crude epithets at a crowd of Hong Kong supporters. One widely circulated video showed four flashy sports cars revving their engines with Chinese flags hoisted out their windows. “Worst ‘Fast & Furious’ movie ever,” said one person on Twitter.
China’s tactics may ultimately work in Hong Kong, though so far protesters appear unbowed by threats of a crackdown. And at home, where independent news sources like The New York Times are blocked, China’s propaganda push appears to be astonishingly effective. Many internet users there reacted with outrage at the images last week of a Global Times reporter who was beaten by protesters at the airport. Chinese social media is awash with the bloodied faces of police and shaky images of foreigners who state media have claimed — often wrongly — are secret protest leaders.
China is using the same tactics abroad, but in most cases, they don’t play well. These include comparing protesters to cockroaches and some cringe-inducing anti-democracy rapping. “Who are you?/Who’s hiding behind the scenes?,” go the lyrics to a rap disseminated by the foreign arm of China Central Television, the state broadcaster. “All I see is a beautiful dream turning to nightmare.”
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
China, since 2010 the world’s second largest economy after the United States, has been determined to build the nation’s soft power. It envies the sort of unconscious sway that the United States enjoys simply through the pervasiveness of its economic and cultural heft. President Trump isn’t going to win any trade wars because people in China love the “Transformers” movies or watch “Game of Thrones,” but American mass media and other cultural exports increase people’s familiarity and warmth with the country’s ideals.
China could use some of that sway about now. Its credibility and legitimacy are under assault in Washington and elsewhere as China hawks rise in prominence.
Under Xi Jinping, its top leader, China has come up with a wide range of initiatives to woo the world with its ideals and its wallet. The “China Dream” envisions a peaceful world in which China plays a leading role. Projects like the Belt and Road Initiative and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank are intended to show the benefits of China’s growing wealth.
“It is easy to dismiss such talk as ‘slogan diplomacy,’” wrote David Shambaugh of the George Washington University in 2015. “But Beijing nonetheless attaches great importance to it.”
“We should increase China’s soft power, give a good Chinese narrative and better communicate China’s messages to the world,” Mr. Xi said not long after he became the president in 2013.
In his most important media policy speech in 2016, Mr. Xi instructed the top official media organizations to learn to tell compelling Chinese stories and build flagship foreign-language media outlets with global influences. Xinhua, CCTV, Global Times and the rest have bolstered their presence in the United States and elsewhere and taken to the very same social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter that Beijing blocks at home. Some accounts have amassed followers of over 10 million.
However, the Hong Kong protests have suggested that Beijing still knows hard power much better than soft. Instead of offering a competing narrative of a Hong Kong that could prosper under Chinese rule, it has instead made itself look like a bully.
Though troops haven’t crossed into Hong Kong, images distributed around the world by Chinese media outlets show heavily armed personnel preparing for urban conflict. Beijing is forcing businesses, both global and local, to keep their Hong Kong employees in line or risk getting cut off from the vast Chinese market. On Sunday, Beijing announced a new policy that will buff up the socialist city of Shenzhen just across the border so it can compete head-to-head with capitalist Hong Kong.
Some young mainlanders are so worked up with nationalistic fervor that they are using software to bypass Chinese censors to log into Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to blast and shame those who support Hong Kong. While that may have some effect on Chinese students living abroad, it has otherwise had little impact.
Contrast China’s approach with Russia’s: Moscow-tied groups have used social media to tremendously disruptive effect in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. But China needs to build a positive image for itself, not tear down the reputation of others.
That is in part why a recent CCTV tweet, comparing the Hong Kong protests to the Nazi rise in Germany in the 1930s, undermines Beijing more than it helps. The post quotes a rewritten version of the poem by Martin Niemöller, the church leader who opposed Hitler, which ends with, “Then they came for me — and there was no one left to speak for me.”
The People’s Daily version compares the persecution of Jews, socialists and trade unionists with protesters storming Hong Kong’s main legislative building, blocking roads and attacking reporters, including an accusation that demonstrators “trampled the freedom of the press.”
Should it continue down the same rhetorical path, China risks eroding what little soft power it has. As Mr. Nye once explained to Chinese university students, “the best propaganda is not propaganda,” because during the Information Age, “credibility is the scarcest resource.”

Hong Kong Was a Refuge for Mainland Chinese. The Extradition Bill Could Change That.,"HONG KONG — Minnie Li understands what is at stake with the contentious Hong Kong bill that would allow extraditions to China. A Shanghai native, she moved to Hong Kong in 2008 to study sociology and then stayed, she said, because she enjoyed its freedom of speech and other civil liberties that are absent in her increasingly authoritarian homeland.
Ms. Li is so worried that the proposed law would toll the bell on human rights in Hong Kong that she joined nearly a dozen other activists last week in a 103-hour hunger strike. She sat on a bridge enduring the blazing heat, pouring rain and riot police shooting tear gas at protesters below her — under an orange banner that said in Chinese, “Hunger strike to show my determination.”
For many mainland Chinese, Hong Kong has long been a refuge that affords a relatively high degree of safety while also serving as a way to stay connected to the mainland. If passed, the extradition bill could change all that.
“It would be like opening a hole in Hong Kong’s legal system,” exposing anyone to the risk of facing trial in the mainland where the legal system is opaque, said Ms. Li, 34, a lecturer at the Education University of Hong Kong. “It would create a white terror that makes you feel that you dare not do anything or say anything that might violate the rules in the mainland.”
Public anger over the bill has driven some of the largest demonstrations in Hong Kong’s history in the past 10 days, throwing the city into a political crisis and forcing its embattled leader, Carrie Lam, to suspend the bill indefinitely and apologize. She has not fully withdrawn the bill, as protesters have demanded.
The bill’s opponents included recent arrivals like Ms. Li, who is among nearly one million people from the mainland who have moved to Hong Kong over the past two decades, increasing the city’s population to about 7.5 million. Many come to Hong Kong not necessarily seeking political refuge, but for schooling, health care and jobs. That influx is part of the reason many Hong Kong residents are frustrated and anxious about their city’s future, and have protested that the new arrivals are overwhelming the city’s public health care, housing and other social services.
Yet Hong Kong has a long tradition of welcoming mainland Chinese seeking refuge. In the late 1800s, the territory was a sanctuary for Sun Yat-sen, the medical doctor who brought down China’s last imperial dynasty. Millions of mainland Chinese fled for Hong Kong in the late 1950s through 1970s in a tumultuous period that spawned mass famine and political upheaval. After the bloody 1989 Tiananmen crackdown on student-led pro-democracy protesters, an underground pipeline called Operation Yellowbird smuggled dissidents to Hong Kong.
“Hong Kong has always been a settlement place for political refugees from the mainland,” said Bao Pu, a publisher and human rights advocate from Beijing, who has lived in Hong Kong and the United States since 1989.
“This is the tradition of what Hong Kong is,” said Mr. Bao, whose father, Bao Tong, was the highest-ranking Communist Party official to be imprisoned after the Tiananmen protests.
Since June, more than 350 people describing themselves as recent immigrants from mainland China to Hong Kong have signed a petition opposing the extradition bill and stating that it could create “serious and irreversible damage.”
The petition laid out a range of concerns commonly cited by human rights groups about China’s Communist Party-controlled security apparatus and judicial system, including forced confessions and closed trials. As cautionary examples, the petition cited imprisoned human rights lawyers and the 2015 disappearance of several individuals from Hong Kong linked to a publisher of racy, rumor-filled books about China’s top leaders.
“The rule of law has been built for centuries,” the petition reads. “We must defend it to the end.”
Some from mainland China who have sought refuge in Hong Kong in the past are sounding alarms. Ma Jian, an author whose first book was banned by the Chinese government, arrived in Hong Kong at the end of 1986 when he found it was getting more and more difficult for him to live in the mainland. He moved to Germany in 1997 when Britain handed Hong Kong back to China, and eventually settled in London.
Mr. Ma said he had returned to Hong Kong frequently since then but never felt in danger until last November, when his talk at a literary festival about his novel “China Dream,” a satire of contemporary China, was briefly canceled. He traveled to Hong Kong anyway, and while the talk ultimately was reinstated, he had a friend accompany him at all times for fear he would be secretly kidnapped and smuggled to China.
The extradition bill, he said, would be the end of freedom in Hong Kong. “You feel like you are in a port of freedom but authoritarianism is approaching,” said Mr. Ma, who said he participated in the hunger strike from afar.
Recent arrivals from mainland China said they worried that the mere introduction of the bill could usher in a new era of self-censorship in Hong Kong.
For Huang Wenhai, 48, a cinematographer who moved to Hong Kong in 2013, the case of the Hong Kong booksellers marked a turning point in the newfound freedom of speech he experienced after arriving in the territory. Because of the incident, a Hong Kong-based publisher wanted Mr. Huang to make changes to a book he had written about independent documentaries in China to avoid topics deemed sensitive by the mainland authorities. He refused and found a publisher in Taiwan instead.
The extradition bill has been another turning point, he said.
“It isn’t just creative people who will find their freedom of speech being limited, but there will also be an impact on businessmen and even regular people,” said Mr. Huang, who also signed the petition.
“It will create a universal fear,” he said. “It doesn’t matter if they censor you or not, you will start your own censoring process.”
Dai Haijing, an associate professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong from Shanghai, said she feared that the bill could curtail sensitive academic research and nonprofit activities. “It doesn’t have to be the law that stops people,” she said. “As soon as there is a fear in everyone’s heart, there will be impact.”
In interviews, few mainland Chinese in Hong Kong said they had made plans to leave, but some said they had started thinking about where they could go. “Everybody in Hong Kong who I have spoken to is asking is there somewhere else they can go,” said Azan Marwah, a human rights lawyer in Hong Kong. “Should they be preparing to leave?”
Ms. Li, the university lecturer from Shanghai who participated in the hunger strike, said she feels strongly connected to Hong Kong and wants to stay. However, when asked if she would start a family in the territory, she said she would move.
“This environment is not suitable for me to have kids,” she said. “I would feel bad for my kids to grow up here.”
Nearly 90 hours into the hunger strike, Ms. Li was sent to the hospital on Saturday night suffering from low blood sugar, a fever and dehydration. As soon as she was discharged on Sunday, she returned to protest.

Hong Kong Protests Raise Stakes for Xi’s Hard-Line Agenda,"HONG KONG — Since he took power seven years ago, President Xi Jinping has faced a growing din of foreign condemnation over his government’s human rights record, a trade war that has sapped China’s strength and now, for a second time, mass protests in the streets of Hong Kong.
Yet again and again, instead of moving toward compromise or change, Mr. Xi and his subordinates have made hard-line decisions that have compounded and complicated pressures on the ruling Communist Party. They have stood by those decisions even after they have blown up into unexpected crises, like this week’s tumultuous demonstrations in Hong Kong against a plan to allow extraditions to mainland China.
“Xi Jinping has been a very good student of Machiavelli — it’s better to be feared than to be loved,” said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University and the author of “China Tomorrow: Democracy or Dictatorship?”
Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, has said she decided to pursue the extradition law herself, without any prodding from Mr. Xi or other Chinese leaders. But several senior Communist Party officials have endorsed the proposal, and it is clear that Mrs. Lam’s move would please Mr. Xi’s government, which wants greater influence over the city.
Beijing appears to be hunkering down for confrontation. The chances of a retreat by the authorities in Hong Kong seem low, because succumbing to public pressure would show them “in a poor light at a time when Xi Jinping wants to assert his authority,” said Willy Lam, a political analyst who teaches at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
In some ways, each crisis makes it less likely that Mr. Xi will compromise during the next one because every new challenge feeds an official narrative that China’s foes are circling and the country must dig in. Early in the trade war with the United States, for example, some in Beijing tried to use the conflict to coax Mr. Xi into adopting market-friendly policies the party has resisted, Professor Cabestan said.
“Now with the level of friction and tensions with the U.S.,” he said, “it has, on the contrary, played in favor of Xi Jinping as a nationalist, so everyone should toe the line.”
And that also makes concessions in Hong Kong less likely. Under such conditions, subordinates like Ms. Lam seem more committed to demonstrating loyalty to Mr. Xi and his authoritarian agenda than pushing options for compromise, several experts said.
After a day of clashes between protesters and the police in Hong Kong, the legislature on Thursday delayed its consideration of the extradition bill, and protest leaders called on the public to keep up the pressure on the government with more protests this weekend.
The proposed legislation would for the first time allow people in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China, with only limited safeguards. Mrs. Lam has argued that the legislation is needed to close a loophole that has allowed people to evade justice and made Hong Kong a safe haven for criminals.
But the pro-democracy opposition in Hong Kong says the measure would accelerate the erosion of civil liberties in this former British colony, which was granted a high degree of autonomy when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Many residents are skeptical of the Chinese mainland’s courts and police forces, which are controlled by the party and have a long record of abuses. They are worried that Beijing will use the new extradition powers to target political dissidents and others in Hong Kong who run afoul of Chinese officials.
Mr. Xi has not publicly commented on the protests in Hong Kong, and he left China on Wednesday on a previously scheduled trip to Central Asia. But the party-controlled news media has accused opponents of the legislation of acting as stooges for foreign enemies trying to foment disorder and humiliate and weaken China.
“The radical opposition in Hong Kong is not seeking the greater good of all of Hong Kong society, but instead is being driven by selfish political interests to gang up with foreign forces hostile to mainland China,” Global Times, a widely read nationalist news outlet, said in an editorial. “Hong Kong residents must grasp clearly that these forces are trying to swindle and mislead them.”
Such denunciations echo the views of Chinese officials who believe that hawks in the United States are determined to challenge China on every front to thwart its rise as an economic, political and military superpower. The rhetoric of confrontation may make it harder for Mr. Xi to explore compromise.
“It is during the Sino-U.S. trade war; therefore, it will be understood as an act of playing the Hong Kong card by the United States,” Tian Feilong, a law professor at Beihang University in Beijing, said of the protests in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong television stations and newspapers have vigorously reported on the protests, but the authorities in mainland China are censoring reports on events in the territory.
“What little the Chinese public knows of the developments in Hong Kong is largely filtered and framed by the Chinese media to minimize the risk that demands for political freedom spread across the border into mainland China,” said Jessica Chen Weiss, an associate professor at Cornell University who studies Chinese foreign policy and public opinion.
Even before the crisis in Hong Kong, Mr. Xi appeared in no mood for concessions to opponents at home or abroad.
For much of the past year, he has been preoccupied with a spiraling trade fight with the Trump administration, which some critics say he has mismanaged and perhaps exacerbated.
Last month, President Trump accused Chinese negotiators of abruptly overturning a draft agreement that was months in the making, a decision almost certainly made by Mr. Xi.
Mr. Trump responded by threatening to punish China with more tariffs. Instead of seeking compromise, China dug in again, threatening to punish American companies and launching a wave of propaganda accusing the United States of engaging in economic bullying.
Mr. Xi has also presided over a prolonged crackdown on both official corruption and political dissent. The anticorruption drive appears to have reduced official graft, but the pressure for conformity has also stifled policy debate among officials and academics.
In Xinjiang, a region of northwest China, Mr. Xi has presided over a sweeping drive to wipe out resistance among Muslim minorities, whom the government has cast as reservoirs of potential terrorism. Hundreds of thousands, and possibly more, have been interned in indoctrination camps that have been condemned by human rights groups, United Nations experts and Western leaders.
“I suspect there is a certain feeling of being under siege at the moment,” said Ryan Hass, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who formerly served as director for China at the National Security Council. “Xi’s response to uncertainty is to grip the reins of control ever harder.”
As the costs of Mr. Xi’s tough policies mount, some have asked how long he can afford to take an uncompromising position on so many fronts.
“The central question is: What is Xi’s calculus?” said Richard McGregor, an expert on Chinese politics at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. “Beijing’s instinct will be to stand its ground and tough things out. But that comes with all manner of consequences.”
“Xi has already agreed to an unprecedented lockdown in Xinjiang which has damaged China’s standing in the West,” he noted. “He is gearing up for a showdown with the U.S. which could hit the economy. Taiwan’s election is on the horizon and his actions in Hong Kong could tip the balance in favor of the candidate that Beijing least wants to win.”
Mr. Xi refused to give ground in 2014 when tens of thousands of protesters occupied major streets in Hong Kong for 11 weeks, demanding democratic electoral reforms blocked by Beijing.
But this time, Mr. Xi is less directly linked to the contentious legislation. He might yet nudge Mrs. Lam to delay the extradition bill or even abandon it if the crisis worsens and the economic costs prompt members of Hong Kong’s pro-Beijing business establishment to break ranks, as some did during a similar showdown in 2003, in which a half-million people marched against proposed national security legislation in Hong Kong. The authorities withdrew the bill soon afterward.
Still, such a retreat would be unusual for Mr. Xi, and perhaps risky, because it would pierce the hard-line reputation he has cultivated and used to reinforce his authority.
“Walking the bill back would send a powerful signal to other groups on other issues that the party will back down in the face of public pressure,” said Jude Blanchette, China practice lead at Crumpton Group, a geopolitical risk advice firm based in Arlington, Va. “This is not a message Xi nor the party in general wants spread.”

"On Hong Kong Handover Anniversary, Many Fear Loss of Freedoms","Promises are the currency of power. In  this series , The Times is going back to the scene of major news events to see how well they have been kept.
HONG KONG — When Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997 after more than a century of colonial rule, it was a moment of immense pride for Beijing, and immense trepidation for a territory that had long enjoyed greater freedom and prosperity than the nation that was reclaiming it.
An authoritarian state run by the Communist Party was taking over a global financial center with independent courts, burgeoning democracy and extensive protections of civil liberties. Would the Chinese government hold to its promise to maintain “one country, two systems” for the next 50 years? Would it let Hong Kong remain Hong Kong?
Beijing was quick to offer reassurances.
“China,” its premier told his British counterpart, “would prove her words by her deeds,” according a declassified British government memo.
But as Hong Kong marks the 22nd anniversary of the handover on Monday, some of China’s recent deeds suggest something else.
Hong Kongers may still enjoy a degree of freedom mainland Chinese can only envy, with freedom of assembly, a free press and an unfettered judicial system. But almost every day brings new evidence those freedoms are slipping away, with the territory falling farther under Beijing’s shadow.
In recent weeks, Hong Kongers have taken to the streets to protest. For many here, there is a sense of time running out.
“There will be a moment that mainland China will completely take over Hong Kong,” said Danny Chan, a 25-year-old primary school teaching assistant who joined a recent protest. “As a Hong Kong citizen, the best we can do is postpone it.”
A war over opium, an island as a prize
The British arrived in China in the late 17th century, bent on trade and empire, and soon found themselves at odds with Chinese rulers happy to export their goods, but far less interested in importing the West’s.
In opium, Britain saw a way in, forcing the drug onto the Chinese market against the wishes of the Manchu emperors.
The British claimed Hong Kong from the Chinese through two wars, later securing part of the territory with a 99-year lease that expired on July 1, 1997.
During the Hong Kong handover talks in the 1980s, China rejected Britain’s desire to continue running the territory, and instead proposed that Hong Kong become a semi-autonomous region of China. China’s then-premier, Zhao Ziyang, told Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain that there should be no doubts about Beijing’s trustworthiness.
And at first, when Beijing took over in 1997, it did take a light touch.
While the fears of many in Hong Kong that their rights would disappear overnight in 1997 proved exaggerated, since then there has been a gradually escalating assault on liberty.
“Unlike in 1997, I think some of the unease today comes from certainty, not uncertainty,” said Peter T.Y. Cheung, an associate professor of politics and public administration at the University of Hong Kong.
China’s controlling approach toward the territory has grown increasingly clear since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012 and set out to strengthen his grip across the country.
“In particular over the past six, seven or eight years, we have seen Beijing tightening its grip over Hong Kong,” said Anson Chan, the No. 2 official in Hong Kong government before the handover and for four years after.
A stalled march toward democracy
During Britain’s rule of Hong Kong, the colonial governor was appointed, and directly elected seats on the legislature were only introduced in the early 1990s.
The Basic Law, which amounts to a constitution for Hong Kong and took effect in 1997, declares that the “ultimate aim” is for the chief executive and the entire legislature to be chosen by voters. In 2007, when China was led by Hu Jintao, it set a date for the vote, saying the chief executive could be directly elected in 2017, followed by the whole legislature.
That did not happen.
In 2017, Hong Kong’s chief executive was once again chosen by a committee that has always done Beijing’s bidding. And nearly half the legislature is made up of representatives chosen by professional sectors, not the voters at large. There is no sign that will change when the legislature is up for election again next year.
“The most significant area of erosion is the promise that 20 years after 1997, Hong Kong should be able to choose its own chief executive through a direct election,” said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. “That promise has clearly not been kept.”
Carrie Lam, who became chief executive in 2017, often says that she has two bosses, Beijing and Hong Kong. But Beijing’s role in choosing the chief executive leads to widespread questions over who calls the shots in Hong Kong.
Beijing did once endorse a form of direct elections for Hong Kong, but with a big catch: Hong Kongers could vote for their leader, the Chinese legislature decided in 2014, but the candidates must first be approved by a pro-Beijing nominating committee. In other words, Hong Kong could elect its own leader, but only from a handful of candidates acceptable to the Communist Party.
Thus was the so-called Umbrella Movement born. Those restrictions set off huge protests in Hong Kong, and demonstrators occupied city streets for nearly three months to protest what they labeled “fake democracy.”
A year later, the Hong Kong legislature rejected the plan, with pro-democracy lawmakers voting unanimously against it. Some suggested that the democratic camp may have missed a chance at an incremental gain that could have later been improved upon.
The long reach of the mainland
When Britain and China hashed out a treaty in the 1980s on what a post-handover world would look like, negotiators were at pains to establish where China’s authority ended and Hong Kong's began.
Foreign affairs? China. National Defense? The same.
But under the terms of the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984, all other responsibilities were to reside with Hong Kong.
In recent years, though, there have been clear signs those lines are blurring, especially when it comes to the realm of justice.
So when Hong Kongers, who were already afraid their autonomy was deteriorating, got word about a new extradition measure coming before the Hong Kong legislature that would ease sending people to mainland China for trial, the result was huge street protests unlike any since the Umbrella Movement — and a delay of the plan by the authorities.
While the extradition measure would make it legally easier for mainland China to seize Hong Kongers, the absence of such a law appears not to have stopped mainland authorities in the past.
In 2015, five people connected with Causeway Bay Books, a Hong Kong establishment that sold gossipy books about mainland Chinese politics, disappeared. One was apparently grabbed off the streets of Hong Kong, another kidnapped from his home in Thailand. Three more were detained in mainland China, where all five were held and one remains in custody.
As lawless as these covert actions may seem, they may be, paradoxically, less of a threat to Hong Kong’s autonomy than overt coercion, since they involve going around the backs of the local courts rather than insisting that judges bend their standards.
Many in Hong Kong fear that the proposed extradition law would allow mainland authorities to directly demand the handover of people wanted in political cases, despite promised human rights safeguards.
After the law was proposed, Lam Wing-kee, one of the previously detained booksellers, fled to Taiwan.
“From the book store incident, you can see that the Chinese government wants to control free speech in Hong Kong,” he said. “Now it’s gotten worse. With the extradition law they want to make such kidnappings legal, and bring Chinese law to Hong Kong.”
A free press in the cross hairs
The Joint Declaration signed in 1984 declares that a free press will be ensured by law. But many media organizations say they are struggling as mainland China undermines that right.
There are many ways such pressure is applied.
Executives at the most vocally pro-democracy newspaper, Apple Daily, say the Chinese government’s liaison office has told large companies to pull advertising.
And last year, Hong Kong expelled a Financial Times editor who had hosted a talk by an activist who called for the city’s secession from China.
The decision to expel a representative of a powerful Western publication sent a chill through many in the city. Some journalists began saying that the long-predicted “death of Hong Kong” had finally arrived.
The independent book publishing industry has also taken a big hit. The Causeway Bay Books detentions shocked many in the industry, leading some businesses to close. The few that remain say they have run into severe difficulties printing and selling books on politics and history in Hong Kong, which they attribute to pressure from the mainland.
Sino United Publishing, a Chinese government-owned company, now controls almost all of the book publishing and retail sales market in Hong Kong. Books banned on the mainland are not found on the shelves of its outlets.
A venerated judiciary, now threatened
Hong Kong’s judiciary is one of the most deeply respected of local institutions, prized for its independence. Its judges, often educated in England, are in the habit of issuing decisions that protect civil liberties.
Beijing promised to protect all that. Instead, it is whittling away at it.
China’s central government made its views on Hong Kong courts clear in a 2014 white paper that called judges “administrators” who must be patriots and for whom “loving the country” is a basic political requirement.
“Hong Kong people are used to separation of powers,” said Martin Lee, a founder of Hong Kong’s Democratic Party who served on the Basic Law drafting committee. “This was alarming.”
While most observers say Hong Kong’s courts remain independent, the fundamental weakness is that Beijing acts as a Supreme Court, deciding how the territory’s laws should be interpreted.
In 2016, Beijing used that power against pro-democracy lawmakers who staged protests during their oaths of office. After the Chinese legislature ruled that oaths must be taken “sincerely and solemnly,” what happened to the lawmakers? They were ousted.
The Takeaway: On paper, Hong Kong’s autonomy is guaranteed for another 28 years. On the ground, the reality appears far less certain.

"For Hong Kong’s Youth, Protests Are ‘a Matter of Life and Death’","HONG KONG — They are on the front lines of every demonstration, dressed in black T-shirts and pumping their fists as they march through Hong Kong’s sweltering streets. They organize on encrypted messaging groups and hand out helmets and goggles at rallies. When the police fired tear gas at them, they chased the smoke-emitting canisters and doused them with water.
Hong Kong’s youth are at the forefront of protests this month that have thrown the city into a political crisis, including a vast rally on Sunday that was perhaps the largest in its history. Organizers contend that close to two million of the territory’s seven million people participated, calling on the government to withdraw proposed legislation that would allow extraditions to mainland China.
For the many high school and university-age students who flooded the streets, the issue is much bigger than extradition alone. As they see it, they are fighting a “final battle” for some semblance of autonomy from the Chinese government.
“The extradition law is a danger to our lives,” said Zack Ho, 17, a high school student who helped organize a boycott of classes. “Once this passes, our rule of law would be damaged beyond repair.”
They are a generation that has no memory of life under British rule, but they have come of age amid growing fears about how the encroachment of China’s ruling Communist Party — and an influx of people from mainland China — are transforming Hong Kong and what they believe is special about it.
Such fears stem from the ousting of opposition lawmakers, the disappearance of several individuals from Hong Kong into custody in the mainland, and the intensifying competition for jobs and housing in a city with soaring inequality. Many young protesters see the extradition bill as hurting the territory’s judicial independence — in their view, the last vestige of insulation they now have from Beijing’s influence.
Youth activism in Hong Kong had ebbed in recent years, after protests demanding a direct say in the election of the territory’s chief executive ended in failure in 2014. The most prominent leaders of what became known as the Umbrella Movement or Occupy Central were jailed, and their legions of young supporters were left bitterly disenchanted.
But the extradition legislation pushed by Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has re-energized young people. Residents express worry that Beijing would use new extradition powers to target dissidents and others who run afoul of Communist Party officials on the mainland.
The young people driving the Umbrella Movement fought for the cause of universal suffrage, said Leung Yiu-ting, the student union president of Hong Kong Education University. But the extradition fight, he added, is “a matter of life and death.”
Compared with older generations, young people in Hong Kong feel less affinity with mainland China and are more likely to see themselves as having a distinct Hong Kong — as opposed to Chinese — identity. Beijing’s efforts to grapple with this have backfired; when officials tried to impose a patriotic education curriculum in schools in 2012, young people led the protests against it.
That was the beginning of this generation’s political awakening, which has accelerated along with the erosion of the civil liberties promised to Hong Kong upon its return to Chinese government in 1997. Those freedoms have long set Hong Kong apart from the mainland, and as they have begun to fray, young people say they feel the threat more sharply.
No one has emerged as the face of the current youth movement as Joshua Wong, then 17, did during the Umbrella protests five years ago. (Mr. Wong was released from prison Monday after serving a month of his two-month prison sentence.)
That is at least in part because of fear. “Who’s going to be quite so willing, openly, to take six years of jail as the prize for the protests?” said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy Hong Kong lawmaker, referring to a sentence handed down last year to Edward Leung, a local activist, for his role in a 2016 clash between protesters and the police.
Instead, organizers have operated behind the scenes by spreading messages about protests and other acts of civil disobedience through social media, word of mouth and secure messaging apps like Telegram.
One result was that high schoolers and university students turned out in large numbers at a mostly peaceful march one week ago Sunday, and also occupied a highway on Wednesday outside the Legislative Council. Medical students and other volunteers provided first aid and free supplies from makeshift tents.
“They are compromising our future, and for what?” Terrence Leung, a recent college graduate, who like many others was demonstrating on Wednesday in a black T-shirt and a surgical mask, said of the pro-Beijing lawmakers who championed the extradition bill.
But in both protests, some among the young demonstrators challenged the authorities with force. The demonstrators tried to occupy the area outside the Legislative Council — or, in Wednesday’s case, tried to storm the complex — pushing metal barriers and tossing bricks, bottles and sticks at riot police officers.
The police responded with pepper spray and batons. On Wednesday, the police also fired 150 canisters of tear gas and, for the first time in decades, rubber bullets. Videos of officers beating protesters and firing volleys of tear gas that sent thousands fleeing drew wide condemnation across the city.
Public anger only grew when Mrs. Lam compared her response to the opposition with that of a mother with a willful child.
Linda Wong, a barrister who organized a rally attended by women who described themselves as mothers opposed to how the police had responded to the young protesters, disagreed with Mrs. Lam’s characterization.
“They came out not for personal interests but for the greater ideal of Hong Kong,” Ms. Wong said. “A good mother shall listen to her own child, and apparently Carrie Lam refuses to do so.”
The police said Monday that 32 people have been arrested since Wednesday’s event, including five for rioting.
“Fear is striking in all of our hearts,” said Mr. Leung, the student union president, referring to the possibility of being prosecuted.
Another risk is that the leaderless nature of the movement raises the possibility of more bloodshed. Analysts say that if demonstrations descend into violence, the authorities would have an easy excuse to prosecute young protesters, discredit them as radicals or attack them with a vengeance.
“If I were them, I would be cautious not to press the advantage too far,” said Andrew Junker, a sociologist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who has studied the Umbrella Movement.
Faced with another enormous protest on Sunday, Mrs. Lam issued a public apology for causing so much anger over the extradition law. Her apology came a day after she promised to shelve the plan indefinitely, but not withdraw it.
This was perceived as too little, too late, and it especially enraged younger protesters, who were bewildered that Mrs. Lam seemed deaf to the concerns of more than a million demonstrators.
“Sometimes I think to myself, is it because I have not done enough? What else could have been done?” said So Hiu-ching, a 16-year-old high schooler who attended a student strike at a park near government offices on Monday morning.
“I go home and cry,” she said, “but after that, I have to get up and try to rally more people.”

"In Hong Kong Protests, China Angrily Connects Dots Back to U.S.","HONG KONG — Jenny Lee, 26, marched with a friend through the sweltering streets of Hong Kong the other day, hoisting an American flag over her shoulder. “We hold this to tell the world that we want democracy and freedom,” she explained.
The authorities in China, however, are holding up those kinds of gestures as evidence of what Chinese officials portray as an American campaign to orchestrate the protests that have roiled Hong Kong for almost three months.
[ As protesters planned more demonstrations, Hong Kong’s leader gave no sign that any more concessions would be forthcoming .]
China’s increasingly caustic accusations against the United States — in state media and official statements — reflect a deepening conviction that support for democratic rights in Hong Kong is part of a broader effort to undermine the Communist Party.
“It’s their bête noire: democracy and democratic values,” said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University and the author of “China Tomorrow: Democracy or Dictatorship?” “The goal is to erase them from Hong Kong.”
There has been no concrete evidence that the protests are anything but what demonstrators say they are: a largely leaderless upwelling of frustration and resistance to the mainland’s encroaching control of Hong Kong’s affairs. But Chinese officials now point to a pattern of American actions that they say amounts to foreign interference, even collusion.
Some of the accusations amount to little more than crude disinformation, but others are grounded in just enough fact to spin a conspiracy theory of covert American nefariousness, intended to loosen the Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s authoritarian grip on power.
They include statements of support for the protests from congressional leaders and Democratic presidential candidates, and meetings between Hong Kong opposition figures and administration officials. One such meeting with a diplomat in the United States Consulate in Hong Kong has been seized on by China, as was another in Washington with Vice President Mike Pence and President Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton.
China’s liaison office in Hong Kong on Monday, for example, vehemently denounced a relatively mild, bipartisan statement by the chairman and a ranking member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, Eliot Engel of New York and Michael McCaul of Texas, that expressed support for the protests and called on both sides “to refrain from violence and seek a peaceful accommodation.”
A spokesman for the Chinese office replied in a statement that the two men, Democrat and Republican respectively, “have ignored the facts, turned black into white, harbored evil intentions and nakedly interfered in Hong Kong affairs and China’s internal affairs.”
China has a long history of blaming “foreign forces” for challenges it has faced internally, including the Tiananmen Square protests 30 years ago. But the depth and ferocity of China’s accusations over Hong Kong suggest they are not merely propaganda intended for domestic or international audiences.
Instead, analysts said, they reflect the thinking of an increasingly anxious leadership that sees any manifestation of popular sentiment in the streets as a potential “color revolution” like those that swept Georgia, Ukraine and later the Arab world.
A 42-page report released recently by China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs singled out the National Endowment for Democracy, the congressionally funded organization founded in 1983 to support the spread of democracy and human rights around the world, accusing it of underwriting a similar revolution in Hong Kong.
“The U.S. is not satisfied in overt oral support for Hong Kong but resorts to financial backing,” the state English-language television network, CGTN, wrote with inexact grammar in an article posted on its website and included in the ministry’s report. The article went on to argue that the endowment acted in concert with the Central Intelligence Agency “in covert actions against governments.”
The Chinese have not only denounced the American activity publicly, but also privately in meetings with their American counterparts, according to officials in both countries. China is also angrily pushing back against international criticism. A spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry, Geng Shuang, denounced a statement by the Group of 7 leaders last week calling on both sides to avoid violence in Hong Kong.
He accused the seven nations — Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States — of “harboring ulterior motives.” He also declared moot the 1984 declaration between Britain, then Hong Kong’s colonial ruler, and China that established the framework for Hong Kong as a special autonomous region, with rights not extended to Chinese citizens on the mainland.
That declaration serves as a congressionally mandated benchmark for American relations with Hong Kong and China under the Hong Kong Policy Act, enacted as law in 1992. The State Department is required by law each year to evaluate the extent of Hong Kong’s autonomy.
“The tempo of mainland central government intervention in Hong Kong affairs — and actions by the Hong Kong government consistent with mainland direction — increased, accelerating negative trends seen in previous periods,” the latest report, issued in March, warned.
The Trump administration, for its part, has reacted inconsistently to the protests. President Trump, focused principally on the trade tensions with China, once dismissed the protests, calling them an internal matter. Others in the administration have spoken out more forcefully, however, and the protests have galvanized support across the political spectrum in Washington.
And that has given the Chinese fodder for their arguments. After initially ignoring the protests, officials have begun to respond to American statements more directly, while turning up the propaganda against the United States in state media, which has been strikingly effective at shaping public opinion on the mainland.
The report on CGTN cited “more American faces” appearing at rallies. One of those that have drawn attention belongs to Mark Simon, a top aide to Jimmy Lai, the Hong Kong media tycoon whom China loves to hate. Mr. Simon, a veteran of the United States Navy, helped set up the meeting between Mr. Lai and Vice President Pence in July that prompted an official diplomatic protest.
Mr. Simon said in an interview that he had long helped Mr. Lai to make donations to civic organizations in Hong Kong, but he emphasized that he had no ties to American intelligence and played no role in the protests, despite insinuations to that effect.
“It’s just ridiculous that a big, fat white guy is running the show in Hong Kong as a C.I.A. handler,” he said.
On the streets, Hong Kong’s protesters have also mocked China’s accusations, saying they were intended to belittle their grievances.
Phoebe Chan, who accompanied her American flag-carrying friend, Jenny Lee, ridiculed Chinese media reports that protesters were being paid to participate. “We are coming out on our own,” she said.
If anything, protesters like her would like to see the United States get more involved. She cited the special trade status that Hong Kong receives under American law, which officials in Washington have warned could be revoked if China were to crack down with force. “This is our hope,” she said.
China’s accusations of foreign influence echo those that other authoritarian governments have made in the face of popular opposition.
Since 2017, China has prohibited any political activity by foreign organizations, under a law modeled on one that Russia adopted after the “color revolutions” swept former Soviet republics.
Hong Kong, by contrast, still allows nongovernmental organizations a great deal of freedom, and the work that many of them do is effectively an affront to the values of the Communist government in Beijing. The National Endowment for Democracy, for example, regularly distributes grants to organizations working to preserve democratic rights — a goal very much in line with the protests.
Its grants in 2018 included $155,000 for the Solidarity Center, the American labor advocacy group allied with the AFL-CIO, and $90,000 to the Hong Kong Justice Center, an organization in Hong Kong that monitors the territory’s compliance with rights defined by the United Nations Human Rights Council.
“The process we’re engaging with is an official United Nations process, which China is a part of,” said Annie Li, a senior researcher with the Hong Kong Justice Center, referring to the annual assessments of human rights known as the Universal Periodic Review. “They’re obviously aware of our work.”
Another organization that has worked in Hong Kong, the National Democratic Institute — a Democratic Party-affiliated partner of the National Endowment for Democracy — received $200,000 from the endowment in 2018. The institute’s president, Derek Mitchell, who previously served as ambassador to Myanmar, called the accusations that Americans have fomented or funded the protests “utterly ridiculous.”
The institute’s work has been to promote civil society by organizing training seminars for scholars, lawyers and civil servants, according to the National Endowment for Democracy’s grant. That the Chinese government views such advocacy as a threat, Mr. Mitchell said, “shows their insecurity.”
“It’s a fairly consistent theme from China and other authoritarian governments,” he said. “They can either accept responsibility for their own behavior, or they can blame others.”

"As Protests Rock Hong Kong, Xi Jinping’s View of History Shows He Will Dig In","BEIJING — When protesters in Hong Kong became more forceful on Monday, the People’s Daily reprised a recent speech of China’s leader, Xi Jinping, calling on party cadres to carry forward the struggle of the Communist revolution fought 70 years ago.
“We must overcome all kinds of difficulties, risks and challenges,” he said.
It was the latest signal that Mr. Xi has no intention of bowing to the protesters’ demands for greater rights. On the contrary, the storming of Hong Kong’s legislature on Monday night seems to have given ammunition to hard-liners and prompted the sharpest denunciations in Beijing so far, suggesting the ruling Communist Party’s patience was wearing thin.
“I think they have realized it is time to take measures” to restore order, Song Xiaozhuang, a professor in the Center for Basic Laws of Hong Kong and Macau at Shenzhen University, said in a telephone interview, referring to the authorities in Beijing.
“This does not mean there is no patience, or that they want to get it done promptly, but it does mean that they cannot wait for long.”
Mr. Xi has not publicly addressed the political tumult in Hong Kong. Nor have officials disclosed any options they might be considering. But there is little doubt about Mr. Xi’s convictions, which are shaped by history and a deeply felt sense of the perils of popular uprisings.
“I have heard him talk at length, and passionately, about the challenges of governing China, and the need to maintain order in order to keep the country together,” said Ryan L. Hass, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who served as the director for China at the National Security Council during the Obama administration.
He noted that the mass protests that toppled authoritarian governments in North Africa and the Middle East in 2011 coincided with Mr. Xi’s ascent to the presidency and were “seared into his brain.”
Mr. Xi’s stance is not without risks, but he has governed with a millenarian sense of destiny, regularly exhorting the Communist Party to return to its original mission to transform a once-humiliated nation into the global power it is meant to be.
While the events in Hong Kong have generated considerable sympathy for the protesters, forcing the city’s leader to back down and suspend a deeply unpopular bill that would allow extradition to China, Mr. Xi still has most of the advantages of power on his side.
Those include time and influence. The central government can still mobilize a vast network of supporters in Hong Kong, including civil servants and business people beholden to the central government, economically or politically.
In a last resort, there is also the Chinese military. Few analysts expect that Mr. Xi intends to use force, but few doubt that he would if security significantly deteriorated in the city.
The People’s Liberation Army disclosed on Tuesday — certainly not by coincidence — that troops from its Hong Kong garrison had conducted training exercises last week. One photograph accompanying an article in the official military newspaper showed soldiers aboard a gunboat in Victoria Harbor, weapons drawn, with the city’s skyline in the background.
After weeks of relative restraint, officials in Beijing have also begun to warn of grave repercussions. A spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, warned that the defacing of the legislature was “a blatant challenge” to Beijing’s red line: its sovereignty over the territory.
The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid controlled by the Communist Party, called for “a zero-tolerance policy,” warning that more violence could open a Pandora’s box.
That the protests in Hong Kong took place shortly following the 30th anniversary of the bloody suppression of the protests in Tiananmen Square and other cities in China has only hardened official views. This year is also the anniversary of the popular movements that swept Eastern Europe in 1989, toppling not only the Berlin Wall but also, ultimately, the Soviet Union itself two years later.
“There has also been a tendency to present these struggles — and Tiananmen was presented this way — as not being spontaneous expressions of the popular will,” Jeffrey Wasserstrom, a professor of history at the University of California, Irvine, wrote in an email, “even in cases when that is clearly what they are.” Rather, he wrote, Beijing describes such protests as “illegitimate efforts by small sets of malcontents spurred on by mysterious foreign forces.”
Mr. Xi, who has steadily amassed greater power than any Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, is acutely aware of that history.
“Why did the Soviet Union disintegrate?” he asked in a secret speech in 2013 that later leaked. “Why did the Soviet Communist Party collapse? An important reason was that their ideals and convictions wavered.”
He belittled the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, for allowing it to happen on his watch. “In the end, nobody was a real man,” he said then.
Weeks before the bloody crackdown protests in Tiananmen in 1989, Mr. Xi delivered a warning about the folly of popular mass movements, according to research by Joseph Torigian, an assistant professor at American University in Washington who is currently writing a book about Mr. Xi’s father.
“This kind of ‘big democracy’,” Mr. Torigian quoted Mr. Xi as saying then, “‘is not in accord with science, not in accord with the rule of law, but is instead in accord with superstition, in accord with stupidity, and the result is chaos.’” Mr. Xi, a city official at the time, was speaking of the Cultural Revolution, but the message carries resonance today.
“Without stability and unity, nothing is possible!”
As the party’s leader, he has sought to extend its grip over virtually every corner of Chinese society, underscoring his view that stability can only be by eliminating threats to the party’s rule.
Hong Kong has become such a symbol of China’s success in reclaiming “lost” territory, Julian G. Ku, a law professor at Hofstra University, said, that the government today would be “loath to admit any kind of limits to its sovereignty of this territory, lest it tarnish its success in recovering.”
When Britain’s foreign minister this week called on China to honor its commitments under the treaty that ceded British control of the city in 1997, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointedly replied that Britain no longer had any say in the matter.
Mr. Ku, who has written on China’s adherence to the treaty, said the spokesman’s bluntness was striking. “They might have always had this legal position but they never, as far as I recall, said this sort of thing out loud.”
Allowing Hong Kong a greater degree of autonomy over its own affairs, as even some pro-Beijing lawmakers suggested, could open the Pandora’s box, the Global Times warned. Hard-liners would argue that it would be seen as rewarding civil disobedience, which security officials on the mainland act quickly to snuff out, at times ruthlessly.
To be sure, Mr. Xi’s record of increasingly authoritarian rule — not least the detention of more than 1 million Muslims in Xinjiang — has raised alarms internationally about the direction he is taking China.
In Taiwan, a self-ruled island that Beijing also considers part of China, the unrest in Hong Kong has further undermined the appeal that Mr. Xi made in January to unify under the same “one country, two systems” arrangement.
President Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election next January, has styled herself as a defender of Taiwan’s sovereignty. Her standing in the polls rose following the Hong Kong police’s heavy-handed response to protesters on June 12.
The protesters’ brief siege of the city’s Legislative Council had echoes of the much longer occupation of Taiwan’s Parliament in 2014, which helped catapult Ms. Tsai to the presidency.
Mr. Wasserstrom said that the Communist Party’s old saying, “Today, Hong Kong; Tomorrow, Taiwan,” now “has a very ominous meaning.”

‘No Regrets’: Hong Kong’s Protesters Test China’s Limits,"HONG KONG — Fat Boy is a college dropout with a youthful blush of acne who excels at playing video games and lives with his mother. He is also a wily commander who leads a ragtag band of protesters willing to risk injury and arrest as they face off against the police.
Fat Boy oversees 50 or so Hong Kong protesters, ages 15 to 35, who focus their attacks on the police, government offices and Chinese-owned banks or other businesses they view as hostile to their movement. Their weapons — bricks, poles and Molotov cocktails — are often met with tear gas and rubber bullets. Occasionally, the police have responded with live fire.
They are part of a core of combative young agitators, garbed in black, who have come to define the antigovernment protests that have convulsed this semiautonomous territory for more than four months and that have posed a bold challenge to the authority of China’s ruling Communist Party.
“You have to earn your rights and freedom,” Fat Boy, 20, said one afternoon this month at his apartment as he and three team members picked at takeout food and talked about their anxieties and aspirations. “For this, we can have no regrets.”
With a self-confidence that frequently veered to bravado, he showed off photos from the day he hot-wired an excavator at a construction site and drove it to the entrance of a police station.
“After I did that, other people copied me,” he said.
The protesters have escalated their use of violent tactics, smashing storefronts, setting bonfires at subway stations and taking justice into their own hands.
On Oct. 13, a protester stabbed a police officer in the throat with a box cutter, leaving him in serious condition. The same day, a homemade bomb detonated by cellphone exploded in a sidewalk planter, though it caused no damage or injuries.
The police warned that the political movement had entered a dangerous new phase.
Hard-line protesters and the authorities are locked in an impasse that feels as if it is edging closer to a fatality or perhaps even an intervention by Chinese troops that could further endanger the civil liberties long enjoyed by the territory’s seven million residents.
The protesters say they have been driven to extremes by a government that won’t meet their demands for greater democracy and an investigation into police conduct. The authorities refuse partly because they believe further concessions would only encourage more violence.
Francis Lee, a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who has conducted public opinion surveys on the unrest, said the police and protesters were trapped in a vicious cycle of surging violence.
“We have reached a stage where it is difficult for either side to escalate their actions without creating backlash,” he said.
The city’s leaders and the police, seeking to drive a wedge between the front-line protesters and the broader public, have cast the demonstrators as rioters and violent vigilantes. Moderates who support the movement’s goals express a growing fear that the violence plays into Beijing’s hands and will undermine public support.
For now, Hong Kong’s residents continue to back the protests by wide margins despite the violence, said Professor Lee, whose polling suggests that at least creating an independent commission on police conduct would go a long way toward defusing the crisis.
“These demands are not radical at all,” he said. “Doing them is very likely to be adequate to kick-start a process of de-escalation.”
Fat Boy, his three teammates and one other front-line protester agreed to be interviewed on the condition that they be identified by nicknames or first names only, for fear of being arrested.
The teammates include Jeff, a 24-year-old musician and skateboarder who quit his full-time job renovating apartments to devote himself to the protest movement; Kitty, a 21-year-old English major who recently left school for the same reason; and Tyler, 34, a construction manager who supports the brigade by supplying the helmets and carbon fiber shields that protect its members during confrontations with the police.
They said they wanted to push back against the Hong Kong government’s narrative likening them to thugs and mainland China’s propaganda that describes them as separatists. Their goals: to seek police accountability and secure the universal suffrage that they say Beijing promised when this former British colony was returned to China in 1997.
Like many Hong Kong youths, the front-line protesters assert an identity that, unlike in generations past, is fiercely distinct from that of mainland China.
Their anger is rooted in a growing sense that China’s Communist Party has worked swiftly to erode Hong Kong’s civil liberties, and as examples they point to the ousting of opposition lawmakers and detention of city booksellers by the mainland authorities.
Samuel, 24, a freckle-faced protester and aspiring songwriter who is not part of Fat Boy’s group, explained, “We just don’t want to become like those Chinese who have become accustomed to living without freedom.”
During protests, Samuel erects roadblocks to slow down advancing columns of officers. He and the others defended their tactics and said they were being driven by mounting police brutality and an inflexible government.
A few of the democracy advocates conceded that the homemade bomb gave them pause.
Longhaired, lanky and contemplative, Jeff, the musician, equivocated when asked whether he approved of the bombing. He said that he didn’t think he could use such a weapon but that he might reconsider if its sole aim was to sow chaos and disperse charging police officers.
“I used to be someone who wouldn’t even throw a brick,” he said. “But every time I encounter an escalation by the police, my limit goes higher.”
With their gas masks and sleek, ninjalike attire, the front-liners are an unmistakable presence during demonstrations. They have adopted the martial arts hero Bruce Lee’s ruminations on flexibility in the face of obstacles — “Be water, my friend” — saying they should behave like a wave that appears at once to pound the enemy and then promptly recedes into countless drops that cannot be contained.
They coordinate moves on encrypted messaging apps and are aided by four tacticians on three continents who remotely monitor the street battles.
It is impossible to know the number of antigovernment protesters who have embraced a more violent approach, but Fat Boy says he is aware of as many as 30 groups whose leaders meet face to face once or twice a month. The groups operate autonomously, with infrequent contact, an arrangement that helps protect them from arrest.
Fat Boy and those who direct the activities of the other groups are the closest thing to commanders in a movement largely characterized by the absence of readily identifiable leaders.
“It would be dangerous to talk to each other,” he said. “If one gets caught, all of us get caught.”
So far, the police have arrested around 2,700 people, though most have been released on bail. About 200 could face 10 years in prison on charges of rioting. Roughly a third of them are under 18, and 100 of them are under 16.
Many of Fat Boy’s claims could not be independently verified, but his mother and the three front-liners on his team corroborated much of what he said.
He has named his team Hogwarts, after the mythical school of wizardry in the Harry Potter series, and says his group was one of the first to use Molotov cocktails, a weapon that was quickly embraced by other front-line protesters as a way to slow the advance of the riot police.
His team has been especially busy this fall. On Sept. 29, two days before National Day celebrations in China, several team members set fire to a subway station entrance, producing huge plumes of black smoke and drawing a battalion of firefighters.
On Oct. 1, they donned Guy Fawkes masks, burned paper portraits of China’s president, Xi Jinping, near military barracks and quickly vanished.
At first glance, Fat Boy is hardly menacing. He shuffles around his mother’s luxury apartment in slippers, toggling between cable news channels and video games like Red Dead Redemption. He rarely sleeps more than a few hours each night.
“I’m mentally and physically exhausted,” he said. “I think the police are tired too.”
As he spoke, Fat Boy’s mother cleaned up the apartment while Jeff and Kitty cuddled on the sofa — their romance began at a protest this summer.
Fat Boy’s mother was once largely apolitical but now attends the protests, handing out food and tending to those overcome by pepper spray or tear gas.
“Every time he goes out, I worry he and his friends will get hurt, or that they might not come home at all,” she said, wringing her hands.
Fat Boy said that his schooling influenced his political awakening. He attended an elite Hong Kong academy that he described as pro-China. It sent him and his classmates to the mainland for a week of military training, where he learned the value of leadership and how to fire a gun.
He later went to school in Canada, where he gained an appreciation for Western-style democracy and civil liberties. He is also well versed in military history and especially World War II, which he says taught him the importance of standing up to tyranny.
Fat Boy’s evolution from peaceful demonstrator to firebomb-throwing provocateur mirrors that of other combative protesters.
On June 9, he joined a million people who took to the streets in the very first protest against a contentious bill that would have allowed residents to be extradited to mainland China. Fat Boy and many others were infuriated after the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, said the legislation would proceed as planned, driving home the idea that peaceful demonstrations were useless.
Three days later, on June 12, he joined thousands of protesters in surrounding the legislative complex to block debate about the bill. A core group lobbed umbrellas and bricks at the police, who responded with what critics say was excessive force, beating protesters with batons and dousing them with pepper spray and plumes of tear gas.
“On June 9, I was just a guy passing out fliers on the street. By June 12, I had 100 people at my side,” he said, referring to the confrontational core of protesters.
To prevent infiltration by undercover officers, Fat Boy scrutinizes the social media accounts of new recruits. So far, he said, only five or six of his members have been arrested, all of them during street fights with the police.
Their support network includes Hong Kongers in Canada, Australia and Britain who help coordinate attacks on the police, he said. Studying protester chat groups and the live feeds from videographers on the ground, these remote tacticians can direct the front-liners — and help guide their retreat.
As he spoke, the rest of the crew was entranced by a particularly graphic video game that Fat Boy was playing on a large-screen TV. His mother winced as a Wild West gunslinger lassoed a man and dragged him to his death.
“It’s so realistic,” she said.
Fat Boy seemed to appreciate the moment’s irony and briefly put down the controls.
“Now it’s like we are playing a video game on the street,” he said with a sigh. “Except it’s real, and it’s not fun.”

Cathay Pacific C.E.O.’s Resignation Shows China’s Looming Power Over Hong Kong Unrest,"HONG KONG — The chief executive of Cathay Pacific Airways, one of Hong Kong’s best-known international brands, stepped down on Friday after a storm of criticism from the Chinese government over its employees’ participation in street protests that have seized the territory in recent months.
The resignation is a sign that China appears willing to put pressure on Hong Kong’s highest-profile businesses to show how serious it is about quelling the unrest, which it has described as “close to terrorism.” Paramilitary forces were seen gathering this week in Shenzhen, across the border from Hong Kong, as the demonstrations grew increasingly violent.
Companies are now working to show that they side with China and the territory’s leaders — and against the protesters. Beijing may increasingly demand that they show they mean it.
In a filing with Hong Kong’s stock exchange late Friday, Cathay said its chief executive, Rupert Hogg, was resigning effective Monday “to take responsibility as a leader of the company in view of recent events.”
Mr. Hogg acknowledged, in an email to employees, that Cathay’s reputation and brand had come under immense pressure, “particularly in the all-important market of mainland China.”
“Could we have managed things differently? In hindsight, ‘Yes,’” Mr. Hogg wrote, without elaborating. He could not be reached for comment.
Mr. Hogg was ousted a week after the Chinese government demanded that Cathay workers who participated in the demonstrations be barred from flying to mainland China, and days after the airline’s leaders met with government officials in Beijing.
The conflict began after demonstrators protested a proposed law that would have allowed the local government to extradite criminal suspects to mainland China, where the Communist Party controls the courts. The movement has broadened into demands that local leaders resign and that residents be allowed to vote in free elections.
Recently, the protests have become more chaotic, culminating this week in demonstrations at the city’s airport that snarled traffic and raised questions about Hong Kong’s future.
Big businesses have tried to reassure the Chinese government that they condemn the mayhem and support Hong Kong’s Beijing-approved leaders. Jardine Matheson, the Hong Kong conglomerate that owns the Mandarin Oriental luxury hotel chain, said Thursday that it “strongly supported” the local government and that the violence had “seriously threatened the well-being of our community.”
On Friday, Hong Kong’s richest man, the property tycoon Li Ka-shing, bought cryptic full-page ads in several local newspapers, using literary language to call for an end to the unrest.
Hours later came the news of Mr. Hogg’s resignation, an abrupt end to a career that spread over two decades at Cathay.
Mr. Hogg began working for the airline’s parent company in 1986, and ascended to chief executive two years ago. As this summer’s antigovernment demonstrations intensified in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous region of China, he found himself in an increasingly precarious position.
Cathay’s shake-up underlines the mounting economic pressures for Hong Kong. Forecasters have predicted that the protests, on top of the trade war between the United States and China, will weigh on Hong Kong’s growth. Tourism has declined, and the Hong Kong stock market is down.
Mainland China has huge economic heft in the city. Once largely dominated by local tycoons and companies that can trace their history back to the Opium Wars of the 19th century, the city’s economy now depends heavily on money from the mainland. Chinese buyers have sent property prices soaring, and mainland developers often outbid local rivals for choice patches of land in a city where attractive plots are scarce.
Like multinationals, many Hong Kong companies also do significant business in the mainland. Foreign firms have often rushed to make sure they do not offend Chinese consumers, who are often goaded into outrage by state-run media. Several luxury brands recently apologized for making T-shirts that suggested that Hong Kong and other territories were not part of China.
“If Hong Kong companies are primarily keeping the consumer in mind, they’re going to compare the seven million people in Hong Kong to the 1.4 billion people in China. That’s a huge difference,” said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, who studies Chinese economic policy.
“In some ways, they’re damned if they do, damned if they don’t,” he added. “There’s so much pressure from consumers, protesters, Beijing, Washington, their board that it’s impossible to satisfy everybody.”
Cathay Pacific became the target of mainland China’s ire after one of the airline’s pilots was arrested late last month in Hong Kong and charged with rioting. In a matter of days, the airline began sending mixed signals about employees’ actions.
On Aug. 7, the company’s chairman, John Slosar, said at a news conference that employees’ political views were not a concern.
“We certainly wouldn’t dream of telling them what they have to think about something,” he said. “They’re all adults. They’re all service professionals. We respect them greatly.”
Around the same time, Cathay said it would investigate accusations that its employees had leaked the travel information for a Hong Kong police soccer team. In the past week, Cathay has fired four workers for misconduct related to the demonstrations. Mr. Hogg also warned employees against taking part in protests that the Hong Kong authorities had not approved.
Chinese state news outlets have continued to criticize the airline’s leadership, and Cathay’s shares have traded at multiyear lows.
China’s big state-run companies appeared to be putting their own pressure on the airline. Bloomberg News reported that China Citic and China Resources, two conglomerates controlled by Beijing, have forbidden employees to fly Cathay for business.
Cathay also has ties to the Chinese government. Air China, which is controlled by a state-run entity, has a significant stake in the airline.
As online outrage was building, China’s aviation regulator imposed what it described as safety measures on Cathay Pacific last week. It ordered the airline to bar employees who “support or take part in illegal protests, violent actions or overly radical behavior” from doing any work involving flights to mainland China. It also required that the company submit information about all crew members who fly to or above the mainland to the authorities for approval.
Mr. Hogg said in a message to employees last Saturday that the airline would comply with the new requirements. But the early reaction from Chinese state news outlets was that the airline’s measures were too little, too late.
As this week began, Merlin Swire, the chairman of Swire Pacific, a conglomerate in Hong Kong and Cathay’s largest shareholder, met in Beijing with the deputy head of China’s air safety regulator. Swire Pacific declined to say what had been discussed, and the Chinese aviation authority did not reply to a faxed request for comment.
A day later, Cathay and Swire Pacific issued nearly identical statements condemning “all illegal activities and violent behavior” and expressing support for “a strong and respected rule of law.” On Wednesday, the airline said it had fired two pilots for violating the terms of their contracts.
Mr. Hogg’s resignation was first reported by China Central Television, the official state broadcaster, minutes before Cathay Pacific issued its news release or posted its notice to the Hong Kong exchange.
The airline said he would be replaced by Augustus Tang, a director of John Swire & Sons (H.K.) Limited, the holding company of Swire Pacific. Cathay’s chief customer and commercial officer, Paul Loo, will be replaced as well, the company said.
Mr. Slosar, Cathay’s chairman, said in a statement that the airline was committed to the principle of “one country, two systems,” the phrase used in both Hong Kong and China to describe the unusual relationship between the two.
“We are confident,” Mr. Slosar said, “that Hong Kong will have a great future.”

Hong Kong Protesters Are Targeting Starbucks. Apple Could Be Next.,"Pro-democracy demonstrators have begun singling out companies that they consider enemies of their movement. Vandalism and calls for boycotts have followed.
HONG KONG — One company is the world’s largest coffee chain. Another runs a Japanese restaurant empire. A third makes some of the most popular online games on the planet.
The global businesses — Starbucks, Yoshinoya and Activision Blizzard — would seem far removed from the political discontent in Hong Kong. But to some of the pro-democracy protesters there, and a growing number of their global allies, the companies are seen, rightly or wrongly, as sympathizers with the authoritarian Chinese Communist Party in Beijing, and as legitimate targets for boycotts or even vandalism.
Protesters are documenting what they see as the companies’ ties to China, then circulating the information on mobile apps and websites — sometimes based on mere rumor, or on comments made by executives or their family members. Starbucks and Yoshinoya have been repeatedly targeted because of the owner of their Hong Kong franchises, while Activision Blizzard, the maker of World of Warcraft, has been subject to boycotts for trying to censor a pro-democracy player in Hong Kong.
The monthslong protests and their fraught politics are rippling overseas, ensnaring an ever wider range of corporations and executives, no matter their nationality. All have spent years cultivating their brands, but now find their reputations in jeopardy over any suggestion that they don’t support the protesters.
Some companies are in the awkward position of trying to dodge questions about the issue, to avoid offending either China, with its vast market, or Hong Kong activists, who have fervent support among Westerners and Taiwanese. After a single recent tweet, the N.B.A. found itself caught between both sides.
“All corporations here are walking on eggshells when it comes to what they say, whether it’s about Hong Kong or about the mainland,” said David Webb, a shareholder activist in Hong Kong.
[A DreamWorks movie  is pulled in Vietnam  for showing a map of China.]
The companies’ vulnerabilities are growing, as activists turn increasingly to vandalism and to boycotts. And Hong Kong’s reputation as a hub of freewheeling capitalism, with one of the world’s most business-friendly environments, is already suffering. These days, workers regularly sweep up glass from shops with broken windows, as shuttered storefronts with graffiti sit in the shadows of gleaming skyscrapers.
Last weekend, protesters called for rallies in shopping malls and a boycott of allegedly pro-China restaurants and stores — with a small, hard-core contingent encouraging the “renovating” (smashing) or “decorating” (spray-painting graffiti) of those locations.
At a Starbucks branch in the Tseung Kwan O district, a few protesters used hammers and a fire extinguisher to smash glass shelves, while others threw plates and trays on the ground. “The heavens will destroy the Communist Party” was spray-painted on a counter.
Activists called for protests at Apple stores after the company removed an app, HKmap.live, from its App Store that showed the locations of police officers in real time. But there have not been attacks on Apple stores yet.
Apple has enormous business interests in China, which is its third biggest market after the United States and Europe, and the decision to remove the app was criticized by pro-democracy activists and lawmakers. Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said the app was removed because people were using it to track down officers to attack them or pinpoint sites to target when the police were not present.
Some protesters have attacked subway stations, including with Molotov cocktails. Many believe the MTR Corporation, the company that operates the subway, has been working with local officials to undermine protests by shutting down some stations, ending service early and, once, closing the entire system.
“The outbreak of vandalism or violence in an operating station will endanger the safety of other passengers and MTR staff,” the company said in explaining the closures.
“When I see people destroying public facilities and stores, I feel pained because you still need money to repair it,” said Michelle Tang, a 40-year-old sales worker. “I want it to be peaceful and free again,” she said of Hong Kong.“Now, I wouldn’t dare say anything if people were smashing glass around me.”
Many activists accuse undercover police officers of carrying out some acts of vandalism to tarnish the image of the mostly peaceful movement.
As the movement settles into a prolonged campaign, activists are systematically pushing for broader boycotts.
One group developed an app, WhatsGap, that tells residents which restaurants to patronize and which ones to avoid. The ones considered friendly to the protests appear on a map of Hong Kong marked in yellow, while those considered hostile have a black marker. The developers plan to add shops.
“For a lot of people not on the front line, these are things they can do,” said Alison Yung, 36, an events planner, who backs the protests. “They can support the movement this way.”
At universities, students are handing out cards with lists of businesses to boycott and staging sit-ins at establishments on campus. Twice last month, people occupied the cafeteria of S.H. Ho College at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
The cafeteria’s caterer is Maxim’s Group, which is also the franchise owner of Starbucks in Hong Kong. Maxim’s has drawn the ire of activists because the founder’s daughter, Annie Wu Suk-ching, said last month in a speech to the United Nations Human Rights Council that the protesters were “rioters” who did not represent Hong Kong.
Maxim’s released a statement saying that Ms. Wu had no position at the company, and that it hoped “all parties” in the political conflict “will resolve their differences.”
Starbucks did not answer an email request for comment.
Yoshinoya also got the attention of activists when its Hong Kong executives fired an advertising agency that created a post on the restaurant’s Facebook page mocking the police. Hop Hing Group, which operates Yoshinoya in Hong Kong, did not return a call seeking comment.
The chief executive of Best Mart 360, a local convenience store chain, was accused of having ties to gangs from Fujian Province in mainland China that have clashed with protesters. (Best Mart 360 has denied any such ties.)
McDonald’s presents a dilemma for the movement. The chain is ubiquitous in Hong Kong (and open 24 hours), and some people have shown their support for the protesters by buying them McDonald’s coupons, to keep them going through the long demonstrations. But some activists have pointed out that McDonald’s sold an 80 percent stake   in its China and Hong Kong business in 2017 to a private equity group comprising Citic, a Chinese state-owned conglomerate, and the Carlyle Group, based in New York.
International support for the protests has made the issue harder for companies to navigate.
Last week, the Chinese government punished the N.B.A. after Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets, posted a tweet in support of the protests. After the league distanced itself from Mr. Morey, some Americans began showing up at games with “Free Hong Kong” posters and banners, and members of Congress chastised the N.B.A.
Activision Blizzard faced a similar backlash after it suspended an e-sports player in Hong Kong, Chung Ng Wai, for voicing support for the movement during a live broadcast. It forced the player, who goes by the name Blitzchung, to forfeit a reported $10,000 in prize money. Many gamers called for a boycott of the company; dozens of Blizzard employees staged a walkout in protest at the company’s California headquarters; and members of Congress spoke up, too.
Blizzard said last Friday it would restore the prize money to Mr. Chung and reduce his suspension to six months, while asserting that the company’s relationship with China had not played a role in the original decision.
Whether the backlash against global brands will result in financial damage is unclear.Some actions taken by the protesters may not have much effect by themselves.
For example, protesters have been calling for a boycott of Cathay Pacific because the airline, under pressure from Beijing, has fired or punished employees who are part of the movement. But for anyone who wants to fly directly from Hong Kong to a Chinese city, it is impossible in most cases to avoid taking either Cathay or a Chinese state-owned airline. Flights between Hong Kong and mainland China are emptier than usual these days not because of a boycott, but because many Chinese want to avoid the protests.
Some activists have made mistakes in choosing which businesses to target. That was the case with Shanghai Commercial Bank. Activists vandalized at least one branch, apparently thinking the chain was based in mainland China.
But the bank is based in Hong Kong. Its motto is “serving the community.”

A Father-Son Split on Hong Kong Protests Shows City’s Generational Divide,"HONG KONG — Wong Yue-kui watched with dismay as a live feed on television showed anti-government protesters peacefully occupying an airport terminal in his city, Hong Kong. This is not going to end well, he thought.
Then he saw his son, Kenny, a 38-year-old insurance agent, among the black-clad demonstrators. For weeks, he had been arguing with him in the hope that he would step back from the increasingly confrontational protests.
Mr. Wong, 65, a bald, tough-looking man, had told his son that it was useless and foolish to challenge China’s ruling Communist Party and the party’s handpicked local officials. He himself had fled the mainland nearly half a century ago, swimming for hours to Hong Kong after his father died while being politically persecuted by the Communists.
“Only politics can solve political problems,” said Mr. Wong, who runs a cellphone accessories stall at a local market. “We ordinary people can’t solve these problems on our own.”

As China marks 70 years of Communist rule, the semiautonomous territory of Hong Kong along its southern border is caught between two worlds. Many in Mr. Wong’s generation had fled the mainland during the excesses of the Mao Zedong era and found stability and a path out of poverty in Hong Kong. The memory of political turmoil and China’s startling emergence in recent decades as an economic juggernaut have served as reminders that learning to get along with an increasingly powerful and resilient Communist Party is key to survival.
[Here is how China is preparing to  exalt President Xi Jinping as its unassailable leader  on National Day.]
But others, like his son, Kenny, see the party’s encroachment on Hong Kong’s affairs in recent years as a threat to cherished political freedoms unseen on the mainland. And they reject the territory’s political elite of bureaucrats and tycoons they see as being more beholden to Beijing.
The protests, as many of them see it, are their last chance to defend the city for the next generation and challenge the party in ways that their predecessors had been unwilling. The protests have escalated in violence and increasingly target Beijing: On Oct. 1, the anniversary, the protesters will march to mark what they have called the “national tragedy” of the party’s 70-year “aggression against China.”
The unrest has become a vivid test of the Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s political agility. At the crux of the challenge is how the party might redefine its sovereignty over the territory to win over those who fear or reject its authoritarian tendencies.
In tackling this, Mr. Xi may draw lessons from his father, a Communist revolutionary who faced a similar challenge in China’s south decades ago. But China’s top leader could find that the promises of economic development that his father made might have limited effect in the current crisis.
Last month, Mr. Wong sent his son a cellphone video of a fight between a group of protesters and pro-government supporters, and urged him to stay home.
Kenny responded: “I wish you would remember the reason why you risked your life to come to Hong Kong back then.”
Life is different now, his father explained; he was poor back then. “But you are in a different place,” he said. “You have your own family, a child. Think about it carefully.” His message was clear: They have more to lose now.
For his son, that wasn’t enough of a reason to stand down.
“What you did was for the sake of your mother and the future,” Kenny said. “It’s the same for me. I’m thinking about my son and the future.”
“Freedom swimmers”
In 1973, Wong Yue-kui was desperate to escape China.
His father, a rice merchant, had died five years earlier in a labor camp where the Communists had sent him after they denounced him as a capitalist. Student militants known as Red Guards had ransacked their home in the southern city of Guangzhou and seized the family’s valuables, including a jade bracelet his mother had hidden in a rice tank.
Mr. Wong was 19 years old, the fifth of six children, and he needed to find better paying work to support his family. He prepared to flee to Hong Kong. His cousin taught him how to swim in a river, whacking him with a bamboo stick each time he reached out to the riverbank. One day, they were ready.
For 15 days, Mr. Wong and his cousin hiked in the hills under cover of night to prevent detection by the border patrol. He survived on five mooncakes and a bag of grape sugar.
At around 2 a.m. on Aug. 18, the two men stripped off their shirts — they had no other possessions — and plunged into the dark waters. Even from that distance, Mr. Wong could see the lights of Hong Kong’s buildings sparkling against the inky night sky. Hong Kong — and freedom — seemed so close.
He swam as fast as he could. Many escapees had been shot by border agents making the same crossing, their bodies washing up on the shores of Hong Kong. He forced himself to focus on getting there. Around five hours later, Mr. Wong crawled onto a muddy embankment. He had made it.
Scholars estimate that as many as one million people fled from China to Hong Kong during the Mao era. Risking death, some fled over the land border, others built boats and many — the so-called “freedom swimmers” — braved the waves head-on.
Villages in China’s south had been emptied, farmland abandoned. The party saw this exodus as a problem and plucked Xi Jinping’s father, Xi Zhongxun, out of political exile. His new task: to guard China’s “southern gate.”
Xi Zhongxun, then the party secretary of Guangdong Province, responded at first by ramping up propaganda in Guangdong. The party exhorted residents to sing patriotic songs and study Mao Zedong Thought. It spread messages depicting Hong Kong as home to evil capitalists. Still, people fled.
The elder Mr. Xi traveled around the province and found that in one border village, residents were making one-50th what their neighbors in Hong Kong were making. Elsewhere, the disparity was even greater. That was when, according to official party lore, he realized that economic development — not ideological education — was key.
“This was the lesson we learned from the facts,” Mr. Xi said when he reflected on that period, according to Chen Bing’an, the author of a book about the history of mainland escapees to Hong Kong, who interviewed the elder Mr. Xi in 2000.
The strategy was largely successful. By 1989, when another wave of mainlanders fled to Hong Kong following the crackdown on Tiananmen pro-democracy protesters in Beijing, gross domestic product in Guangdong had grown nearly sixfold and the number of illegal migrants fleeing from the mainland to Hong Kong had slowed to a trickle.
The Mainland Rises
In Hong Kong, Mr. Wong hopped from job to job, working stints at a denim factory and as a construction worker. He regularly sent money back to his family. “Use this to bring Dad’s bones back,” he told his mother in a note sent along with part of his first paycheck.
He met and married a woman from the city, and they had two children. He saved up enough to buy two apartments. For years, Mr. Wong was the envy of his siblings who had stayed in the mainland. He had more freedom and more money to buy higher-quality goods.
But about a decade ago, he noticed the dynamic changing. His siblings were starting to become wealthier. They bought bigger apartments. They had good government pensions. They were no longer so interested in visiting Hong Kong. Recently, when he asked them before the Mid-Autumn Festival if they wanted mooncakes from Hong Kong, he was stung when they said no.
“Now their lives are better than mine,” Mr. Wong said wistfully. “If I had known back then how developed China would become, I never would have left.”
Mr. Wong’s community of mainland escapees in Hong Kong remains closely connected. Many knew one another as children growing up back in Guangdong; others met later in Hong Kong, through friends or through work. Now in their 60s and 70s, most of them retired, they gather regularly for dim sum, Ping-Pong sessions and mah-jongg tournaments.
But the recent turmoil in Hong Kong has exposed a new fault line within this typically tight-knit community. Though most escapees initially fled to Hong Kong in search of economic freedom, many, like Wu Hay-wing, a retired truck driver, say they’ve come to wholeheartedly cherish the political freedoms they found once they arrived. Unlike Mr. Wong, the cellphone accessories seller, some in his group regularly join the protests.
“The essence of the Communist Party has never changed — it is a totalitarian regime,” said Mr. Wu, 68, who made it to Hong Kong in an improvised boat.
Mr. Wu said he feared that Hong Kong would soon become just another mainland city.
“If that happens, what did I escape here for then?” said Mr. Wu. “All my efforts would have been for nothing.”
Still, there is a certain degree of nostalgia for the motherland. Many, even those who identify now as Hong Kongers, still maintain close ties with relatives on the mainland and make regular trips across the border. Some made large fortunes by leveraging their ties with the mainland.
In contrast, many among Hong Kong’s younger generation of protesters reject being connected to the mainland and assert what they see as a distinct and separate Hong Kong identity. Others accept Chinese rule but hope to pressure the party to loosen its grip over Hong Kong.
Mr. Wong’s son, Kenny, was in his early 20s when he began to grow concerned over Beijing’s influence. Protests had erupted in 2003 over the city’s attempt to impose national security laws. Later, when hordes of mainland travelers swept through the city to empty its shelves of baby milk powder and vaccines because of safety scandals in China, his anxiety grew.
Unlike his father, though, his feelings about the mainland have not changed with China’s rapid economic development.
“You can’t judge a place by money alone,” Kenny said at a recent interview at a cafe in the city’s financial district. “There also needs to be freedom.”
Conscious of their already-strained relationship, the father and son have sought to avoid talking about the protests. Mr. Wong often grumbles that Hong Kong’s problem is a lack of patriotic education; children grow up without learning to be proud of all that China has achieved.
On that point, Kenny is in surprising agreement with his father. He referred in a separate interview to the Chinese term for patriotic — ai guo — which means, literally, “love country.”
“I can get behind loving the country,” he said, “but I cannot love the party.”

Hong Kong’s Mask Ban Reveals Carrie Lam’s True Face,"The city’s leader announced an emergency law to restore order. It was a deliberate provocation.
HONG KONG — This city has long prided herself on respecting the rule of law — the ultimate guarantee of Hong Kongers’ freedoms, human rights and way of life. It is one of the attributes that make Hong Kong stand apart from cities on the Chinese mainland. Our practice of common law, together with an independent judiciary served by high-caliber judges, has earned us the trust and the confidence of friends and trading partners all over the world. Our legal system’s predictability and its freedom from political interference guarantee that no one will fall victim to the arbitrary exercise of power by government authorities.
Or so it did. All of this changed last Friday when Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s besieged chief executive, unilaterally decided to invoke the Emergency Regulations Ordinance to prohibit face masks and other coverings at public gatherings. The new regulation — formally called the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation and, more commonly, the face-mask ban — makes it a criminal offense punishable by one year of imprisonment for people to hide their faces in ways that prevent identification, even if they are participating in lawful meetings or marches.
Mrs. Lam said the ban was designed to stop violence and restore order, but her move only added fuel to the fire. Thousands of people — in masks — took to the streets all weekend, even after service was suspended across the entire underground system. There were clashes with police. A 14-year-old was shot in the leg.
The ordinance is an archaic statute from 1922, when Hong Kong was a British colony and the acts of the city’s governor were regulated by the monarchy in Britain. Since Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, it has had its own Constitution, the Basic Law, which is supposed to protect the city’s autonomy from China under the “One Country, Two Systems” principle. Acts of the chief executive should be reviewed for compliance with the Basic Law.
Article 39 provides that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights will continue to apply in Hong Kong after 1997. Article 73 vests the legislative power of Hong Kong in the Legislative Council. Article 8 says that any laws previously in force that contravene the Basic Law cannot be maintained.
On Friday, Mrs. Lam violated all of these provisions. To take one example: She usurped the lawmaking function of the Legislative Council by bypassing the council altogether. LegCo is scheduled to reconvene on Oct. 16; Mrs. Lam could have waited until then to propose her ban as a bill. She now claims that her regulation is subject to “negative vetting” by LegCo, or vetting after the fact. Yet it should not have come into force until after it was reviewed by LegCo.
Mrs. Lam announced the ban by fiat, and with that, Hong Kong has just moved one step closer to becoming an authoritarian regime, ruled at the executive’s pleasure without institutional or systemic safeguards. We are moving away from the rule of law toward rule by law.
The invocation of the emergency ordinance is unlawful, and so the face-mask ban should be deemed inherently void.
Mrs. Lam knows this fact only too well, and she knows that she may yet lose any judicial review of the law’s constitutionality. So why did she do this? She is reported to have initially been reluctant to pass the measure. But then, suddenly, she passed it — just three days after returning from Beijing, where she attended celebrations for the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China.
President Xi Jinping might well have given her the marching order. The Chinese Communist Party (C.C.P.) is haunted by the images of millions of peaceful marchers taking to the streets of Hong Kong to demand the freedom, the human rights protection, the rule of law and the preservation of Hong Kong’s way of life that they have been promised under the Basic Law but have been treacherously denied.
The authorities’ calculation seems to be that if masks are banned, future rallies will be smaller. Some protesters will not be deterred. But others — especially peaceful demonstrators who are civil servants and employees of government-funded NGOs, Chinese businesses or conglomerates that actively trade with China — will be reluctant to assemble or march. Already, the local airline Cathay Pacific has fired employees, including pilots, who had expressed sympathy on social media for the protest movement.
At the same time, the pushback by dedicated protesters this weekend was so predictable that it is impossible not to think that it, too, was a desired effect. The ban was also designed to provoke the more radical factions of the protest movement into escalating violence. Mrs. Lam and the C.C.P. can then invoke any such deterioration, as well as, say, acts of arson — or even, some fear, crimes by agent provocateurs planted by the police — to call the movement a riot and its participants vandals.
One of their hopes is that more Hong Kongers may then distance themselves from the movement because of the increased social costs. Another is that the movement will lose some of the moral authority it seems to command with liberal democracies around the world.
A more sinister explanation is that further violence on the streets could become an excuse to impose a curfew, formally or de facto, and pass other extreme emergency regulations. Members of the major pro-government party are also said to worry about their prospects in the district council elections scheduled for late November: Chaos would be a convenient pretext to postpone or cancel those.
Legislators from the democratic camp have started a legal battle challenging Mrs. Lam’s ordinance and are asking that it be reviewed judicially. The High Court refused this weekend to order an interim injunction to stop the ban from taking immediate effect but has said that the case could be heard in full before the end of October.
We already knew that “One Country, Two Systems” was dying; now we know that the rule of law is dying too.

Facebook and Twitter Say China Is Spreading Disinformation in Hong Kong,"tml>SAN FRANCISCO — China has adopted Russia’s playbook for spreading disinformation on Facebook and Twitter, deploying those tactics in its increasingly heated information war over the protests that have convulsed Hong Kong.
In recent weeks, Facebook and Twitter accounts that originated in China acted in a coordinated fashion to amplify messages and images that portrayed Hong Kong’s protesters as violent and extreme, the two social media companies said on Monday. On Facebook, one recent post from a China-linked account likened the protesters to ISIS fighters. And a Twitter message said, “We don’t want you radical people in Hong Kong. Just get out of here!”
Facebook and Twitter said they had now removed the accounts, the first time that the social media companies have had to take down accounts linked to disinformation in China.
Facebook said it eliminated seven pages, three Facebook Groups and five accounts involved in the disinformation campaign about Hong Kong protesters. Twitter deleted 936 accounts and said it would ban state-backed media from promoting tweets after China Daily and other state-backed publications placed ads on its service that suggested the protesters were sponsored by Western interests and were becoming violent.
“These accounts were deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong, including undermining the legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement on the ground,” Twitter said in a statement. “Based on our intensive investigations, we have reliable evidence to support that this is a coordinated state-backed operation.”
The removal of the China-backed accounts signal an escalation in the global disinformation wars. In 2015 and 2016, Russia pioneered disinformation techniques when it used Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social media to disseminate inflammatory messages intended to divide Americans in the 2016 presidential election. Since then, governments in many other countries — including Bangladesh, Iran and Venezuela — have also used Facebook and Twitter to sow discord at home and abroad.
China has been less visible about using Facebook and Twitter to spread disinformation, researchers said. Both services are blocked in the country and people instead spend time on homegrown social media services and messaging apps like WeChat and Weibo. The Communist Party has largely not needed Western social media because it already exerts tight control over state-backed media and content inside the country’s so-called Great Firewall.
But the recent Facebook and Twitter activity over the Hong Kong protests suggests that Beijing will use those services to spread its messaging outside the Great Firewall when it deems it necessary. Facebook and Twitter are not blocked in Hong Kong and are widely used. Some 4.7 million people in the territory log into Facebook at least once a month, while 448,000 use Twitter, according to eMarketer.
Asked about the actions by Twitter and Facebook, Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Tuesday that Chinese media outlets were doing nothing underhanded in sharing their views about the Hong Kong protests.
“I think it‘s entirely reasonable for Chinese media to use social media platforms abroad to engage with the public to explain China’s policies and tell China’s story,” Mr. Geng told a regular news conference in Beijing. “I don’t understand why certain companies or certain people have such an intense reaction. Maybe it’s poked holes in their own shortcomings.”
China may have previously dipped its toe into using Western social media to destabilize elections in Taiwan starting in 2018, said Graham Brookie, the director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. He added that China’s disinformation campaigns tended to be less wide-ranging than Russia’s and hew tightly to a set of foreign policy goals, including tying Taiwan and Hong Kong closely to the mainland.
“The Chinese have been watching what works and what doesn’t in the context of Russian information operations,” Mr. Brookie said. “China is testing the waters on what is effective and what they can get away with.”
The disinformation campaign against the Hong Kong protests also stands out because many of the tweets were written in English and targeted a global audience.
“I think they are trying to reach English speakers in Hong Kong and the larger audience of people watching,” said Adam Segal, director of the Digital and Cyberspace Policy Program at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Many of the Twitter accounts involved in the Hong Kong campaign were recently created and did not have large followings, said Renee DiResta, the Mozilla Fellow in media, misinformation and trust. “It reveals almost a lack of sophistication in terms of how China is thinking about developing this outward capability,” she said.
Since the Hong Kong protests began in June to demonstrate against an extradition bill, the movement has evolved. On Sunday, the city was the scene of another huge march, which organizers said brought out 1.7 million people — or nearly one in four of the total population of around seven million — who walked in defiance of a police ban.
China has aggressively stoked anti-Western and nationalist sentiments around the protests and begun branding the demonstrations as a prelude to terrorism. Hong Kong workers and billionaires have also jumped into the fray. In ads in several local newspapers, the tycoon Li Ka Shing recently pushed readers to “love China, love Hong Kong, love yourself” and “overcome anger with love.” And employees at accounting firms in Hong Kong have taken out ads supporting the demonstrations.
Twitter said it discovered the China-linked accounts during an investigation that spanned several weeks. The accounts worked together to blast out messages that could undermine the Hong Kong protests, with some of the accounts using Twitter from specific unblocked internet protocol addresses, the company said. Since Twitter is not permitted in China, an unblocked IP address is typically a telltale sign that the accounts were approved by the government, researchers said.
Although most of the disinformation was spread by the 936 accounts that Twitter eventually took down, the company said it also uncovered a broader group of 200,000 accounts. Those sprang up once Twitter began banning some of the earlier accounts; the majority of them were stopped before they were able to spread more messages, the company said.
Among the messages that the China-linked accounts posted was a tweet suggesting protesters were “taking benefits from the bad guys.” Another claimed the protesters had “ulterior motives.”
Twitter said it would give state-sponsored media a month to leave its advertising platform before its ban on promoted tweets from state-backed media goes into effect. The ban expands on the company’s efforts to combat Russian disinformation. In 2017, Twitter banned RT and Sputnik, international news outlets supported by the Kremlin, from advertising on its service.
Unlike Twitter, Facebook said it would not ban ads from state-owned media. The company said it would “continue to look at our policies as they relate to state-owned media” and also closely examine ads that were flagged to it so it could determine if they violated its policies. China’s government, through its state media agencies, has been a big buyer of ads on Facebook, The New York Times has reported.
Twitter alerted Facebook to the coordinated China-linked social media activity in July, a Facebook spokeswoman said. The Facebook pages that the company identified in its own investigation typically posed as news organizations and were followed by about 15,500 accounts. Most of the pages were created in 2018 or later, with the earliest page flagged in the investigation set up in 2016. While the people behind the activity tried to hide their identities, Facebook said it “found links to individuals associated with the Chinese government.”
“Protesters, ISIS fighters,” one of the Facebook posts said, “What’s the difference?” Another called the protesters “Hong Kong cockroaches.”

Hong Kong Is a Work in Progress,"HONG KONG — July 1, the anniversary of the day that Hong Kong was reunified with mainland China in 1997, ought to be an occasion for celebration. It marks the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region under the “one country, two systems” — the first such region in China. Yet on Monday, the date’s 22nd anniversary, guests received instructions to go to a confidential location before being ferried to the site of the ceremony.
Celebrations of Hong Kong’s handover from Britain have been punctuated by sporadic protests over the years. The former legislator Leung Kwok-hung, also known as Long Hair, typically tries to disrupt the proceedings by shouting out antigovernment slogans from a distance. Officials have learned to shrug him off. Peaceful marches are now held annually on July 1 — following on a mass protest in 2003, a reaction to a national security bill that I championed then, in my capacity as secretary for security. (The bill was scuttled and I left government shortly after the debacle.) But such demonstrations, which typically are held in opposition to what people perceive as encroachments by the Chinese authorities in Beijing, are, if anything, evidence of the abundance of rights and freedoms that exist in Hong Kong.
For this July 1, because protests over the so-called extradition bill were anticipated to swell to very large numbers as well as take on a more violent character, the police locked down a large area around the city’s prime convention and exhibition site to ensure that the flag-raising ceremony commemorating the handover could take place uninterrupted.
The fugitive offenders bill, as the proposed legislation is officially known, was designed to facilitate the extradition of criminal fugitives to mainland China, among other jurisdictions. (It has now been suspended.) It included strong safeguards against the arbitrary surrender of suspects. But many Hong Kongers’ distrust of mainland China’s legal and judicial system is so deeply rooted that opponents of the legislation were able to stir up widespread fears that it could be used to send people in Hong Kong to the mainland to face phony charges without the protection of due process.
Repeated protests of this kind undermine Hong Kong’s reputation as one of the safest cities and leading financial centers in the world. Yet it would be impetuous to write it off or to sound the death knells of “one country, two systems” simply because of recurrent tensions over Hong Kong’s relations with its sovereign power.
Critics and skeptics should bear in mind that “one country, two systems” is, and was designed to be, a work in progress. It’s just that this unique model is proving more challenging to put into practice than was anticipated before 1997.
The truth is that when Britain and China signed the 1984 Joint Declaration — the agreement that set out the basic terms under which colonial Hong Kong would be handed over to China in 1997 — both governments were satisfied that they had come up with a way to give Hong Kong a separate system even after its reunification with China. But that grand formula would still need to be tested against the actual and evolving situation in Hong Kong, and we are all discovering that much about its implementation remains unresolved and conflictual.
Consider the city’s political system. The Joint Declaration stated that, “The chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be selected by election or through consultations held locally and appointed by the Central People’s Government.” It made no reference to universal suffrage. That notion appeared only in the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-constitution: “The ultimate aim is the selection of the chief executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures.”
From the first day of its establishment as a special administrative region of China, Hong Kong has had a hybrid political system — partly elected, partly appointed — which has left much room for argument and disagreement between parties with opposing views. How to elect the chief executive, Hong Kong’s top official, is what triggered the 79-day occupation of some of the city’s major streets in 2014. The media in the West romanticized those protests as the “Umbrella Revolution.” But the pro-establishment bloc condemned them as unlawful and divisive, a challenge to the authorities in Beijing and a threat to Hong Kong’s stability and prosperity.
Likewise with the Hong Kong government’s recent drive to amend the extradition laws. The scale and violence of the protests against the proposed bill — leading to the unprecedented capture of the Legislative Council on Monday — amply demonstrates that deep and rancorous divisions remain in Hong Kong’s society.
There are also highly divergent visions of Hong Kong’s relationship with its motherland and its place in the Chinese nation. At one end of the spectrum are democrats, localists and advocates of independence who urge maintaining a “firewall” between mainland China and Hong Kong or even moving toward a complete separation. At the other end, are patriots or nationalists who preach nothing short of total integration. (The authorities in Beijing, for their part, insist that Hong Kong is “an inalienable part” of China but with “a high degree of autonomy.”)
Nothing justifies violence, but given these divisions, the young of Hong Kong can be forgiven for feeling frustrated, helpless and even angry at the lack of direction and of a common vision for Hong Kong’s future. They also face a growing wealth gap, an acute land and housing crisis and shrinking opportunities for upward mobility given rising competition from elites and entrepreneurs from mainland China. Successive Hong Kong leaders have failed to convince them that Hong Kong’s future will be brighter than were its days before reunification.
Yet it would be fatuous to give up on “one country, two systems.” The Basic Law remains the best guarantee of maintaining Hong Kong’s separate system, its rights and freedoms and its unique lifestyle. Without it, Hong Kong would lose its economic and political influence over mainland China. It would, indeed, become just another Chinese city — which is just what the protesters fear.
Hong Kong’s culture, noisy and boisterous — at times, even dangerously rebellious — shows no signs of abating. The people of Hong Kong who are seeking more autonomy, more rights and more freedoms than the Basic Law allows should not make the best the enemy of the good.
“One country, two systems” is a political compromise, and it takes mutual understanding and restraint to maintain the delicate balance it requires. The world is showing great concern for the city’s welfare. But the onus remains on the leaders of Hong Kong to convince the Chinese authorities of what is best for the city — and to win the support of the masses by showing them that a measured and holistic interpretation of the Basic Law can resolve Hong Kong’s residual conflicts.

Hong Kong Protesters Call for U.S. Help. China Sees a Conspiracy.,"The United States, viewed as a champion of democracy, occupies a symbolic role in the protests. Activists now want President Trump to take a tougher stand against Beijing.
HONG KONG — The Hong Kong protests at times seem like love fests with the United States. Depending on the day, demonstrators wave American flags or Uncle Sam recruitment posters, and even dress as Captain America, complete with shield.
The United States represents democracy, and the activists hope that maybe, just maybe, it will save Hong Kong. Five months in, they are trying harder than ever to draw the United States into their movement.
The protesters are pressingHong Kong officials and their overseers, the authoritarian Communist Party leaders of China, for greater democratic rights and rule-of-law in the autonomous territory. As they see it, the Trump administration might be able to make demands of Chinese leaders or Hong Kong officials, especially because members of elite political circles want to maintain access to the United States.
Also, they note, the trade war with China, started by President Trump, is adding pressure over all on President Xi Jinping.
For the American government, the protests are more complicated — a potential policy dilemma but also a potential point of leverage with Beijing and a way to channel American values to the rest of the world.
“The United States should continue to deter Beijing from use of force, maintain an unblinking eye on Hong Kong, and make Beijing pay a heavy reputational cost for curtailing the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong citizens,” said Ryan Hass, a former State Department and National Security Council official now at the Brookings Institution.
Yet, he added, “I worry that the protesters in Hong Kong risk misinterpreting American sympathy and support of their cause for expectation that the United States will shield them from Beijing’s heavy hand.”
If the protesters are sending out a siren song, some American officials and lawmakers are answering it, eager to show their commitment to the cause.
Members of Congress have appeared in Hong Kong in public displays of solidarity. Last month, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, donned an all-black outfit, while Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, posted photographs from a protest.
In Washington, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, has met with activists, pro-democracy politicians and Jimmy Lai, a publisher considered radioactive by Beijing. Vice President Mike Pence singled out Hong Kong as a beacon of liberty in a speech, saying, “We stand with you; we are inspired by you.”
And versions of a bill that would give support to the protesters are moving though Congress with bipartisan backing. The legislation, among other things, would allow the United States to impose economic sanctions and a travel ban on Hong Kong officials deemed responsible for human rights abuses.
“We hope this bill will pass,” said Selina Po, a 27-year-old protester wearing a mouth mask in the Admiralty neighborhood as she held up a sign with the bill’s name, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. “It’s our hope for winning this war. We’re trying all we can.”
But American officials say the United States needs to weigh its moves carefully.
Greater involvement by Americans could give Beijing more ammunition in its propaganda effort to portray the pro-democracy movement as one stoked by foreign forces.
The Chinese government and state-run news organizations talk about “black hands” behind the unrest and spread conspiracy theories, including one centered on an American diplomat in Hong Kong who was photographed with activists in the lobby of the JW Marriott Hotel.
As the protests persist, American officials are watching for surges in violence and tracking the movement of People’s Liberation Army soldiers into Hong Kong. Some are beseeching demonstrators to stick to nonviolent tactics, even in the face of police crackdowns and attacks by people sympathetic to Beijing.
On Sunday, at least six people were injured when a man with a knife who is believed to be against the democracy movement attacked a family at a shopping mall. In the melee, the attacker bit off part of the ear of a pro-democracy district council member, Andrew Chiu.
“We’re telling everyone that we interact with, we don’t want violence,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday. “We think there should be a political solution to the conflict that’s taking place there.”
Two Democratic Congressmen, Tom Suozzi of New York and John Lewis of Georgia, the icon of the American civil rights movement, posted a video last month praising the activists for their “great work” and urging them to stick to nonviolence.
Whether the United States takes greater action on Hong Kong hinges on the unpredictable Mr. Trump. Administration officials and American lawmakers talk openly about checking the authoritarian impulses of the Chinese Communist Party. But the president rarely, if ever, mentions human rights and democracy, and he has not made consistently strong statements on Hong Kong.
He is a transactional president. In June, he told Mr. Xi on a call that he would stay quiet on Hong Kong as long as Washington and Beijing were making progress on trade talks, according to an American official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
In October, the Trump administration imposed some restrictions on Chinese companies and organizations for their roles in the mass repression of Muslims in mainland China, but Mr. Trump has held back from harsher actions for fear of upsetting the trade negotiations.
If a Hong Kong bill reaches Mr. Trump’s desk, analysts say, the president might see it as merely a tool to wring concessions from China and could forego support if a trade agreement were close.
“Strong American bipartisan support for the peaceful protesters is not enough to override President Trump’s transactional instincts,” Mr. Hass said. “He does not look at Hong Kong through a values-based lens. And as long as he remains president, this outlook will limit America’s responses to developments in Hong Kong.”
Administration officials argue that Mr. Trump’s approach gives the United States a stronger hand in constraining Beijing on Hong Kong — even if it appears that Mr. Trump just wants to use the Chinese territory to his advantage.
“America expects Beijing to honor its commitments,” Mr. Pence said, “and President Trump has repeatedly made it clear it would be much harder for us to make a trade deal if the authorities resort to the use of violence against protesters in Hong Kong.”
In the eyes of Beijing, there has been no shortage of provocations by American politicians. On Oct. 22, Ms. Pelosi posted on Twitter a photograph of herself on Capitol Hill with three pro-democracy figures — Mr. Lai, Martin Lee and Janet Pang.
“My full support and admiration goes to those who have taken to the streets week after week in nonviolent protest to fight for democracy and the rule of law in #HongKong,” she wrote.
On Wednesday, Ms Pelosi slammed the decision by Hong Kong officials to bar the activist Joshua Wong from running in local elections. She said it was “another blow against rule of law in Hong Kong and the principle of ‘one country, two systems,’” referring to the foundation for the policy of autonomy that Britain and China agreed would be used to govern the territory.
Ms. Pelosi met Mr. Wong in Washington in September.
A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, lashed out, saying, “It is precisely because of the naked cover-up and connivance of external forces such as Pelosi that the violent anti-law forces are even more fearless.”
“No matter how your eyes are blinded by prejudice, no matter how your heart is filled with evil, Hong Kong is China’s Hong Kong,” the spokeswoman added. “Any attempt to interfere in Hong Kong affairs will not succeed.”
Many demonstrators want American intervention and are focusing their attention on the legislation. The mere threat of American sanctions, they say, would give the movement greater voice with Beijing.
On Oct. 14, the night before a vote on the bill in the House of Representatives, protesters held a rally in the Central district to call for its passage. Tens of thousands attended, many of them carrying American flags.
“The power of Hong Kong people alone is limited, and we need other countries, such as the U.S., to help us counter China and keep ‘one country, two systems,’” said Eric Kwan, 32. “I doubt the act can be an ultimate game-changer, but I think it is enough to give pressure to China.”
Along with allowing for sanctions, the legislation requires the State Department to review each year whether Hong Kong is still autonomous enough to qualify for the benefits of the 1992 Hong Kong Policy Act, which grants the city a trade and economic status different from that of mainland China.
Some American officials say the bill could harm Hong Kong residents if the United States determines that the territory no longer qualifies as an autonomous entity. But the bill’s proponents defend its practical and symbolic value.
“Standing in support of Hong Kongers and preserving Hong Kong’s autonomy should be a priority of the United States and democracies worldwide,” said one of the bill’s sponsors, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida.
The bill passed the House by unanimous vote last month. Though the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has not scheduled a vote yet, the measure is expected to pass that chamber easily, with a veto-proof majority. Then Mr. Trump would have to decide whether to sign it into law.

The Hong Kong Protests Are About More Than an Extradition Law,"If we are to believe Carrie Lam, the chief executive of the Hong Kong government, the hundreds of thousands of people who marched through the city’s sweltering streets on Sunday just didn’t get it. They may have thought they were protesting a proposal to allow extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China, but, in Ms. Lam’s view, they failed to understand that the measure would ensure that the city did not become a haven for fugitives and that existing legal protections and human rights would remain in force.
And if we are to believe the press in mainland China, that vast throng was really “some Hong Kong residents” who had been “hoodwinked by the opposition camp and their foreign allies” into opposing the legislation, to cite the version in China Daily, an organ of the Chinese Communist Party.
No, Ms. Lam and editors of China Daily, the people of Hong Kong were not “hoodwinked,” nor did they misunderstand this legislation.
They understand very clearly that the measure making its way through the local legislature, where pro-Beijing deputies hold sway, has nothing to do with bringing murderers to justice, and everything to do with breaking down the firewall between Hong Kong’s rule of law and mainland China’s thoroughly politicized judicial system. They understand that the legislation represents a further encroachment by Beijing into the “high degree of autonomy” Hong Kong was promised when Britain returned the territory to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
Ms. Lam, at least, did not publicly question the motives of the protesters, who came out in the biggest numbers since at least the 1997 handover. “I believe most of the protesters yesterday loved Hong Kong and came out for the sake of the next generation,” she said. In pledging to protect human rights, she at least acknowledged the core concern of the residents of every age and calling who so jam-packed the downtown streets that other people couldn’t get out of subway stations.
Beijing, by contrast, showed its true colors by playing down the protests and spreading the shopworn canard that they were the work of “foreign forces.”
“We firmly oppose any outside interference in the legislative affairs” of the region, intoned the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, perhaps oblivious to the irony that the only interference was by his government.
Ms. Lam has not backed down on the extradition bill, and neither she nor the city legislature is likely to buck Beijing. Under Hong Kong’s limited democracy, the chief executive is approved by Beijing and only half the seats in the legislature are filled by popular vote, though Ms. Lam insisted on Monday that the extradition bill was not imported from the mainland.
The residents of Hong Kong demonstrated once again that they will not easily surrender the civil liberties they learned to regard as their self-evident due under British rule. Five years ago, protesters of the Umbrella Movement occupied central city streets for 79 days to demand more transparent elections. And in 2003, an effort to enact a package of laws prohibiting sedition, subversion and treason against the Chinese government was shelved after half a million residents poured into the streets in protest.
Hong Kong’s freedoms are a standing irritant to the Communist authorities in Beijing, who have not ceased chipping away at them. One example is a draft law to criminalize disrespect for the Chinese national anthem; another is the disappearance of people from Hong Kong into mainland custody.
The extradition measure was initially presented as needed to send a Hong Kong man to Taiwan, where he allegedly killed his girlfriend. But to the democracy-minded people of Hong Kong, this was only cover for a portion of the bill that would also allow extradition to mainland China, which would enable Chinese authorities to pry political foes from Hong Kong by leveling false accusations and demanding their extradition. That, in effect, would extend China’s reach into Hong Kong and strip its residents of the protection of the law.
Sunday’s protesters vowed to be back in the streets when the bill next comes before the legislature. If Ms. Lam really believes they are acting out of concern for “the next generation,” she would do well to heed them and shelve this cynical assault on Hong Kong’s rule of law.

The Making of a Chinese Patriot,"What happens when you mix rage, shame and pride with years of nationalist education?
Over the past few months, reports on Chinese mainlanders hurling curses at Hong Kong protesters have disturbed people around the world. These self-appointed guardians of Beijing’s authority have appeared in Australia, where they shouted profane insults in Mandarin about the mothers of a group of Hong Kong supporters. In Canada, mainland students driving their Ferraris and Aston Martins to “demonstrate force” derided Hong Kongers as poor and added an expletive for good measure.
As a mainlander who lives overseas, these accounts were shocking to me. The overseas Chinese students I’ve met, to be clear, are nothing like these protesters; I was both sad and horrified to see images of a young Chinese man holding a sign telling Hong Kong sympathizers in London to “kneel down” in front of their “master.” (He, too, used more profane language.)
But when I read these accounts, I thought about the last time I was back home in Shanghai over the summer. While I was there, I watched television in the evenings with my mother. From 7 p.m. to 10 p.m., there were only two options: shows focused on food, or TV dramas set during the Sino-Japanese war. We often opted for the latter, and so our nights were spent watching well-dressed Communist Party members outsmarting the Japanese invaders on every occasion. “If they had been as invincible as they were portrayed on the television,” my mother commented once, “why would the war have lasted eight years?”
I thought about the connection between what I’d watched and what I was now reading about — a generation shaped by shows like these, designed to convert the human cost we paid for today’s prosperity into nationalist zeal and to send the message that we should feel anger toward Japan and others, while believing firmly in China’s current path.
The first thing to note about Chinese patriotism is that it was born out of conflict. Unlike in a democratic country where the people vote to elect their leaders, the Chinese Communist Party first claimed the mantle of legitimacy after the Sino-Japanese War. That is, the party led the Chinese people to eventually overthrow “the rule of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism,” and “founded the People’s Republic of China,” as the preamble of our Constitution puts it. As a result, to love the state means to endorse the party. “Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China,” the famous “red” song goes.
And it was also born out of shame. Growing up, we learned that the Qing government was so weak that it signed many unfair treaties with the Western and Japanese colonizers over the course of the 19th century. We learned that even after the empire fell apart in 1911, the new government, dominated by warlords, was corrupt enough to let Japan occupy Shandong province after World War I. We learned that millions of our countrymen had been killed during the Sino-Japanese War. We internalized the trauma of the Nanjing Massacre in 1937-38.
We were steeped in this before we were even old enough to understand the messages we were supposed to be absorbing. Today, it is almost funny to recall that the first naked woman I saw on the big screen was from “Red Cherry,” one of the patriotic movies we watched as a mandatory part of our curriculum. In one scene, a Chinese teenager was forced to walk on the dinner table naked, showing a giant Nazi tattoo on her back to a group of German officers. Looking back, it’s a good antiwar movie, but I was only a primary school student. Sitting in the movie theater with my class, I had no idea what a Nazi was. What I remember was that it shocked me to see the girl’s bare body, and later to see a different girl trying to burn herself to remove a similar tattoo.
In other movies, we saw the famous 14-year-old Communist Party hero, Liu Hulan, walk courageously up to a fodder chopper, refusing to save her life by betraying the other party members in her village. We witnessed Chinese people being lynched, raped and buried alive by the Japanese, and watched as some of them still managed to chant patriotic slogans all the way to the end. When we returned to school from the movie theater, the teachers asked us to learn their spirit of “ningsibuqu”— to prefer to die than to surrender.
After years of schooling, every Chinese national is left with a wardrobe of collective enemies: the Western countries and Japan. No sensible adult would be foolish enough to adopt this completely black-and-white view. But a hostile mind-set can still get the better of us when nationalistic sentiments are involved.
To many mainlanders, for example, the recent protests in Hong Kong brought back humiliating memories of the Chinese Empire at its weakest. When I saw pictures of Hong Kong protesters hanging a British colonial flag in the legislative building, I could feel, even in my own blood, the fury slowly gathering. The next day, I happened to talk to a Chinese friend, who had been forwarding sympathetic posts about the protests only a few days before. “If they want to kiss up to the previous colonizer,” she said, “leave them alone.”
When more violent pictures of the Hong Kong protests filled Chinese social media, I was having dinner with an old friend in Shanghai, a consultant trained in both China and America. “How can the protests,” he asked me, “be so well-organized if they are not orchestrated by the United States in the first place?” The logic was flawed, I thought. The Hong Kong protests were a leaderless movement, organized through the internet. But I didn’t want to say so, because I didn’t want to quarrel.
Of course we should remember our history. But when I try to understand my friends in China, and those horrible overseas Chinese nationalists, I think about the way lessons about our colonized past have morphed into a crackdown on voices that differ from Beijing’s. We have been victims in the past, and so now Chinese people must share “one heart” and “one faith.” We must all want to see China grow into a strong nation, one that defies the best efforts of our collective enemies to thwart us — and anyone who criticizes government policy or doubts a government narrative is “un-Chinese,” a “running dog” of foreign forces.
We are trapped in this rhetoric. Nobody wants to seem unpatriotic, so in the increasingly tense political climate in China, moderate patriotism is silenced and extreme patriotism is becoming the loudest, if not the only, voice.
Most of us love our country. It’s almost an instinct, like the attachment we bear toward our kin. Perhaps the bigger question is how to make patriotism a matter of education, not indoctrination. There is a lesson here for every country, not just China. If patriotism is taught first and foremost to perpetuate power, to control people, to prepare them as soldiers for potential conflict and war, the result is the same: It is a young man, holding a sign, telling another person to kneel down in front of his master.

I’ve Been Waiting for a Song Like ‘Glory to Hong Kong’ My Whole Life,"I just didn’t realize it.
HONG KONG — First came the goose bumps. Then came the tears running down my face. Standing on the second floor balcony of one of Hong Kong’s biggest shopping malls last Thursday night, I turned away from the crowd, trying to hide the fact that I was weeping. But I soon realized I wasn’t alone: A sales lady who’d sneaked out from one of the designer shops also had tears in her eyes; a bespectacled young man nearby quickly removed his glasses and wiped away tears. “O daughters and sons, for justice, revolution of our  time ,” we sang together. Never had I felt so connected with strangers.
I was at a rally that night with hundreds of people, all of us belting out the words to “Glory to Hong Kong.” The song — a sweeping, stately march dedicated to the city’s pro-democracy protests — has become the city’s unofficial anthem within a matter of weeks. For this Hongkonger, who spent the first half of her life growing up under British colonial rule and then struggled to find her place after Hong Kong was handed over to China in 1997, the experience of hearing it has been transformative. Never had I imagined there could be a song, sung in my native tongue of Cantonese, rather than English (although there is an English version of the song) or Mandarin (the lingua franca of mainland China), that could evoke such a sense of pride and belonging.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
I have been waiting for a song like “Glory to Hong Kong” my whole life, even if I didn’t always realize it. Growing up in the 1980s under British rule, I’d basically never heard of “God Save the Queen.” (We were never required to sing it, even though a photo of Elizabeth II did hang in the principal’s office at my primary school.) It wasn’t until 1996, when the Hong Kong windsurfer Lee Lai-Shan stepped onto the podium after winning the city’s first and only gold medal at the Atlanta Olympics, that I realized this song was, technically, “our” national anthem. But I did not know it and had absolutely no feeling for it.
Perhaps our closest equivalent to an anthem before the 1980s was Roman Tam’s “Below the Lion Rock,” a ballad that served as the theme song for a TV show of the same name, which first aired in 1972. The show, which focused on the daily lives of ordinary Hongkongers struggling to make a living, struck a chord with many, and the lyrics of “Below the Lion Rock” evoked the hardships people faced while still trying to come together “to pen the everlasting Hong Kong story.” The show and song gave birth to the so-called “Lion Rock spirit” — but the ballad, while beautiful, is not easy to sing along to. And as Hong Kong has evolved into a first-world society, its lyrics no longer resonate in quite the same way, particularly with young people who dream of more than just a job that keeps food on the table.
We did, briefly, have the Cantonese song “For Freedom.” Written exactly 30 years ago when the pro-democracy movement in China seemed to be gaining momentum and Hong Kong’s entertainment business was at its peak and still at the forefront of the city’s political fights, the song was written and performed by the era’s brightest Canto-pop stars. “For Freedom” served as the theme of the Concert for Democracy in China, a 12-hour marathon concert attended by hundreds of thousands of people to raise money for students in Beijing on May 27, 1989. Structured like an eighties power ballad, with a distinctive rhythm, “For Freedom” is largely in Cantonese, though the key lines — “Love freedom, for freedom” — are in Mandarin.
At the time, 10-year-old me also attempted to play the song on the piano at home, despite my very limited skills. But China’s pro-democracy movement ended in bloodshed and in the decades since, “For Freedom” seems to have been largely forgotten. The celebrities who once led the people of Hong Kong in singing “for freedom, you and I, hand in hand, fight together” have either passed away or moved on. Some, like Alan Tam, Kenny Bee and Maria Cordero, who sang for students in Beijing 30 years ago, have become supporters of the police today, attending pro-police, pro-government rallies.
Then there was “Boundless Ocean, Vast Skies,” a song by the legendary Hong Kong rock band Beyond. The song evokes a yearning for freedom in spite of obstacles. Five years ago, it became the de facto anthem of the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement, eclipsing another song, “Raise the Umbrella,” which had been written to capture the spirit of the protests. But the song is relatively mellow; its appeal to the emotions is subtle. It does not have the swelling orchestral strains of “Glory to Hong Kong,” which seem to have channeled Hongkongers’ hopes, fears and despair in a unique way.
As “Glory to Hong Kong” spread like wildfire over the past week, echoing through the atriums of shopping malls across the city day after day, I felt both inspired and nervous. The song both symbolizes and accelerates the birth of a renewed Hong Kong identity — the last thing Beijing wants. It was only a few months ago that the Hong Kong government was planning to introduce a new national anthem law that proposed making intentional insults to “March of the Volunteers” — the national anthem of the People’s Republic of China — a criminal offense. That bill has been postponed amid the current crisis, but in the meantime “March of the Volunteers” is being deployed by pro-Beijing protesters, like those who sang it during lunch hour at a Central Hong Kong mall last Thursday, creating a cacophony of dueling anthems.
One of the moving things about “Glory to Hong Kong” is how the song came together. Its primary composer has opted to remain anonymous; he goes only by the name “Thomas.” Its lyrics were crowdsourced and refined on an online forum that has become a hub for protest organizers, where people also made recordings of themselves singing it, which were combined in the final track. As people continue to sing defiantly in the streets and in malls, what could be a better symbol of our leaderless movement? We don’t need a law to tell us what song to respect; we no longer even need Canto-pop stars to tell us what we should sing. Hongkongers have good ears, and good hearts. We know when the right piece of music comes along, one that genuinely represents who we are. May glory be to Hong Kong.

"Beijing’s Hong Kong Strategy: More Arrests, No Concessions","HONG KONG — The arrests on Friday of prominent democracy lawmakers and activists in Hong Kong reflect a tactical escalation by China’s leaders to curb the recent street violence, but which could prolong the protests for many months.
Officials in Beijing, along with the Hong Kong government that answers to them, have decided on a policy of stepped-up arrests of demonstrators, who would be publicly labeled the most radical of the activists, according to Hong Kong cabinet members and leaders of the local pro-Beijing establishment.
In interviews over the past two weeks, these local political figures stressed that China wants the Hong Kong police to carry out the arrests — not Chinese soldiers, whose intervention in the city’s affairs would be unprecedented.
[ Tens of thousands of demonstrators returned to the streets on Saturday, despite a police ban .]
Beijing has also ruled out making concessions to the demonstrators, they said. With protest leaders also vowing not to back down, the officials acknowledged that the price of the strategy could be months of acrimony, possibly stretching into 2020.
“I hope we can start the process of reconciliation before the end of the year,” Ronny Tong, a member of Hong Kong’s Executive Council, or cabinet, said in an interview last week.
Beijing and Hong Kong officials are betting that the protests will gradually die down as the police detain the most hard-line demonstrators, and that public opinion will turn more decisively against the use of violence, said Lau Siu-kai, a longtime adviser to the Chinese government on Hong Kong policy.
The Hong Kong police said on Friday that they had arrested more than 900 people this summer in connection with the protests. Some of the local political figures estimated that as many as 4,000 protesters were seen by the authorities as radicals, but that it was unclear how many would eventually face legal action.
The police, who have been accused by demonstrators and international rights groups of using excessive force, have “not used their capacity to suppress the protests” until very recently, said Mr. Lau, who ran the city’s policy planning agency for a decade until 2012.
With broad public backing from mainland China, “the mood of the police was lifted up and they became even more ferocious in putting down the protests,” said Mr. Lau, who is now vice chairman of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, a semiofficial advisory body set up by Beijing.
With China’s hard-line leader, Xi Jinping, dealing with a trade war with the United States, a strategy of attrition in Hong Kong could be seen as preferable to a rash approach that might risk spiraling into a major crisis.
But it is far from clear how much success the authorities will have with their strategy of arresting protesters, resisting concessions and delaying negotiations. The arrests have begun to draw criticism from around the world.
The handful of democracy activists and lawmakers who were arrested on Friday have relatively moderate reputations. They include Joshua Wong, who rose to global prominence with the so-called Umbrella Movement protests in 2014, and who has publicly called this summer for protesters not to use violence. Mr. Wong and another activist, Agnes Chow, were later released on bail.
Demonstrators have contended that at least some of the violence attributed to them may have been instigated by undercover police agents. The police have acknowledged infiltrating the protests with officers dressed to look like demonstrators.
Protesters also suspect the authorities of involvement in a spate of attacks on democracy activists by men armed with sticks, baseball bats and even meat cleavers. Similar incidents in Hong Kong over the years have been linked to organized crime groups, which have a history of ties to Beijing.
The mutual distrust has become so great that not only are the authorities and pro-democracy activists not holding talks, but the informal contacts that once existed between the government and the older generation of activists — who, themselves, are mistrusted by many of the younger protesters — have essentially come to a halt.
Each side has worried that any effort to quietly negotiate a deal would be torpedoed by leaks, embarrassing anyone who might try to strike a compromise. From the government’s point of view, those fears were realized when Carrie Lam, the chief executive, met with local young people this week, only for a recording to be leaked to Apple Daily, a pro-democracy media outlet.
Democracy advocates consider Mrs. Lam a puppet of China’s leaders, but they have also ruled out talks with the Liaison Office, which represents Beijing’s interests in Hong Kong.
“This is the situation we are in: absolutely no back channel and total distrust between the two sides,” said Alan Leong, the leader of the Civic Party, one of Hong Kong’s largest pro-democracy parties.
“How would I in my right mind walk into the Liaison Office — that would upset the whole unity” of the democracy movement, he added.
The democracy advocates have agreed not to criticize the violent tactics of some of the younger protesters — a turnaround for many of the older activists, who have shunned violence since Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997. Some pro-democracy lawmakers with decades-long track records of opposition to Beijing say they have been characterized as sellouts by hard-line protesters when they suggested compromising or refraining from violence.
“They will not listen to us, they think we are all outdated,” said Anson Chan, a longtime campaigner for democracy who was Hong Kong’s second-highest official in the years immediately before and after the 1997 handover.
On Tuesday, Mrs. Lam announced plans for a “platform for dialogue” to find a way out of the political quagmire. But she has sought to meet with neutral community leaders, not the opposition, and she has already ruled out accepting any of the protesters’ five demands, which include universal suffrage, amnesty for protesters and an investigation of the police’s conduct.
Given how polarized the city is now, it has been hard to find neutral figures with whom Mrs. Lam could meet, said Mr. Tong, the cabinet member, who is working on the matter for the chief executive.
Mr. Lau, the adviser to Beijing, said that democracy advocates were overestimating the extent to which Chinese leaders worried about being embarrassed internationally by the protests.
He said they paid more attention to how events in Hong Kong were seen within mainland China, adding that public perceptions there of disorder in Hong Kong had led to a nationalistic wave of support for Beijing.
The Chinese government has pushed those perceptions itself, through the state media’s misleading coverage of the protests.
The Chinese military’s police conducted large exercises just across the border from Hong Kong this month as a show of force. But those exercises were aimed at showing that China is prepared for any contingency, and were not a preamble to any plan for actual deployment in Hong Kong, Mr. Lau and others familiar with the exercises said.
The maneuvers followed plans, drafted years ago, for clearing hostile crowds who establish prolonged control of large urban areas — a tactic that Hong Kong protesters used for months in 2014, but have largely avoided this year.
Martin Lee, a veteran pro-democracy campaigner and founder of the Hong Kong Democratic Party, said that Beijing did not want anything to mar its Oct. 1 celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. Beijing “won’t allow bloodshed to happen in Hong Kong before then — after Oct. 1, beginning on the 2nd, I don’t know,” Mr. Lee said.

"With Hymns and Prayers, Christians Help Drive Hong Kong’s Protests","HONG KONG — Armed with a Bible, a guitar and a drawing of Jesus walking on water, Andrea Wong sat outside the offices of Hong Kong’s central government and booed.
Ms. Wong, 18, usually stays out of politics. But in recent weeks, as Hong Kong was swept by mass protests against closer ties with mainland China, she asked herself what a good Christian would do.
“I am very certain that Jesus would not have stayed home enjoying the air-conditioning,” Ms. Wong said. “He would have been out here helping people and marching.”
Christians have been a visible part of the protests this month — among the largest in Hong Kong’s history — providing food and shelter at demonstrations and condemning efforts by the police to break them up. Many protesters, even those who are not religious, have embraced the teachings and messages of Christianity to denounce a proposed law to allow extraditions to mainland China.
Protesters have spoken of “loving thy neighbor” and winning a battle of “good versus evil.” Youth groups have held prayer circles to call for peace and redemption for the police. A hymn called “Sing Hallelujah to the Lord” has become an unofficial anthem of the demonstrations, echoing from bridges and makeshift shelters.
Hong Kong’s Christians have long played an important role in the politics of the semiautonomous Chinese territory, on issues like religious freedom, democracy and human rights. And though Catholics and Protestants make up only about one in nine people in this city of 7.5 million, the influence of Christianity in the protests has been striking, providing a source of inspiration and solace.
“We believe in upholding justice,” said David Cheung, a pastor who has taken part in the protests. “Our faith gives us our courage, confidence and hope against this evil government power.”
Christians’ influence is all the more noticeable as Chinese officials have tightened controls over religious life in the mainland. Last year, Beijing reached an agreement with the Vatican recognizing the legitimacy of government-appointed bishops, a deal that was criticized by Catholic leaders in Hong Kong.
Many Christians said they saw the extradition measure as opening a door for China’s severe restrictions on religious freedom to make their way into Hong Kong.
“The law is unjust,” said Carita Ng, 52. “It is very dangerous to citizens like us because it deprives us of free speech. As Christians, we need it more than anyone.”
The extradition bill was indefinitely suspended on Saturday after large numbers of people had taken to the streets twice in four days. The measure would allow criminal suspects to be transferred for trial in jurisdictions including mainland China, where the courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party.
On Sunday, a day after the bill was suspended, protesters turned out in even bigger numbers, with crowds that organizers estimated at close to two million people demanding that the measure be fully withdrawn.
The demonstrators have focused much of their ire on Hong Kong’s top leader, Carrie Lam, who is a devout Catholic. On Tuesday, Mrs. Lam apologized for her handling of the bill and promised to better listen to the concerns of the public. Many protesters, who have called on her to resign, were unsatisfied with her apology.
For Christians, Mrs. Lam’s actions have a religious dimension. Many say they believe she has sinned and should step down. At the same time, they say they pray for her and hope she has a chance at redemption.
“She has gone astray,” said Ms. Wong, who has spent up to 10 hours a day singing, praying and marching during the protests. “I hope she will have the wisdom to do the right thing.”
On Monday, Mrs. Lam met with religious leaders and apologized. She told them she was lucky to be able to turn to her faith in a difficult time, according to the Rev. Canon Peter Douglas Koon, who attended the meeting. Mrs. Lam asked the leaders to pray for her and for Hong Kong, Father Koon said.
Among the first to speak out against the proposed extradition law was Cardinal Joseph Zen, the retired archbishop of Hong Kong.
Beyond worries that the law could be used by mainland officials to punish churches in Hong Kong, Cardinal Zen said Christians were united with other protesters by a fear that the law would leave Hong Kong residents vulnerable to the whims of mainland courts.
“Our clergy is rather conservative; not many usually come out,” he said. “But I think this is a moment when we should stand with the people. Otherwise, we are against the people, and there is no middle way.”
The prominence of Christianity in the protests has lent legitimacy and protection to the protesters, helping them go up against government officials like Mrs. Lam who initially dismissed their demands and compared them to spoiled children.
Some protesters who gathered outside the local legislature were advised to sing hymns because religious assemblies are more difficult for the police to break up.
On Wednesday, Cardinal John Tong of the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong and the Rev. Eric So, chairman of the Hong Kong Christian Council, called on Mrs. Lam to withdraw the extradition bill and begin an independent inquiry into the police response to the protests.
A judicial challenge has also been brought against the police alleging that an officer made a discriminatory remark when he told a group of clerics at a protest, “Ask your Jesus to come down and see us.”
Hong Kong, which was a hub for Christian missionaries under British rule, is now home to about 850,000 Christians and more than 1,500 churches. Many members of the middle and upper classes are Christians or studied at Catholic schools.
Chan Shun-hing, a professor of religion and philosophy at Hong Kong Baptist University, said the involvement of churches conferred on the protesters an image of nonviolence and morality.
“Christians still enjoy a very good reputation in society,” he said. “Whenever they talk, people will side with their positions.”
Alan Leong, the chairman of the pro-democracy Civic Party, said his religion had given him hope in taking on adversaries that seemed much bigger, like the Chinese Communist Party.
“On the face of it, it seems that you are no match for this ruthless power,” he said.
While pro-democracy protesters have in the past sometimes mocked Christian activists as zealots, many people of differing beliefs have rallied behind church leaders in the recent protests.
Alex Auyeung, a 27-year-old counselor, is not religious. But after participating in the march this past Sunday, he visited a small church.
Mr. Auyeung arrived with difficult questions. Was it possible to overcome intense dislike for the police and to see them as human? Was a mob mentality among protesters prevailing online? What does forgiveness mean?
“We are at a very fragile moment,” he said. “We need to bring calmness and wisdom to people.”
He read from Corinthians, clasped his hands and bowed down to pray.

The Battle for Hong Kong Is Being Fought in Sydney and Vancouver,"How Beijing is weaponizing social media in its fight to crush the Hong Kong protests.
MELBOURNE, Australia — As the police deploy tear gas against protesters on the streets of Hong Kong, another battle is raging less visibly: the one for narrative control. After weeks of asserting that the unrest had been orchestrated by foreign “black hands,” Chinese officials on Monday accused protesters of showing the first signs of “terrorism.” Such messaging is key to Beijing’s public opinion operation, which has been turned up to full volume.
The weapons of this information war include a flood of social media posts from state-run media, some carrying misinformation. When a woman dispensing first aid was shot in the eye by the Hong Kong police, the state-run CCTV reported on its official social media account that she had been shot by protesters. It also accused her of handing out money to demonstrators. Chinese readers are unlikely to question the veracity of such an authoritative source, and CCTV’s Weibo post, which says the movement is slandering the Hong Kong police by blaming them for the injury, has been liked more than 700,000 times.
Ten weeks ago, when Hong Kongers first took to the streets to protest disputed extradition legislation, Beijing censored all reports of this civil unrest. But in recent days, it has reveled in posting video of protesters purportedly using air guns, slingshots and petrol bombs against the police. The state-run Global Times has described protesters as “nothing more than street thugs who want Hong Kong to ‘go to hell,’” or as people who had “voluntarily stripped themselves of their national identity.” Such descriptions are aimed at delegitimizing the protesters’ cause, especially among educated mainlanders who might otherwise be sympathetic.
Chinese people living or studying overseas are another important audience for Beijing’s messaging. Their primary news diet is largely delivered via WeChat, a Chinese chat app where messages are subject to censorship, so they often still fall within Beijing’s propaganda orbit. Recent pictures of an American diplomat meeting two activists, Joshua Wong and Nathan Law, were used to bolster Beijing’s claims of hostile foreign forces backing the protests. On Tuesday, scenes of a Chinese state media worker being tied up at the airport and beaten by young protesters flooded Chinese social media, bolstering calls for Beijing to intervene militarily in Hong Kong.
Such messaging helps to mobilize Chinese communities, especially newly arrived migrants in Australia, Canada, the United States and elsewhere, to support the official line from Beijing. One website for a planned protest this weekend in Sydney asks Chinese to stand together against “rioting” in Hong Kong, which it said was causing discrimination against Chinese in Australia.
The battle over Hong Kong is, in effect, being exported, pitting overseas Chinese communities against each other. Over the past few weeks, “Lennon Walls,” covered in colorful Post-it notes expressing support for Hong Kong, have been torn down by supporters of Beijing from Auckland, New Zealand, to Vancouver, British Columbia, and from Hobart, Australia, to Harvard Square. After a violent tussle between pro-China and pro-Hong Kong students in late July at the University of Queensland in Australia, the Chinese consul-general in Brisbane, Xu Jie, issued a statement praising the “spontaneous patriotic behavior of Chinese students.”
One reason this conflict is playing out on social media is that almost all of Hong Kong’s big media companies are owned by mainland business executives or groups with extensive business interests in China, so they have instinctively taken a pro-Beijing stance. This has left digital news outlets and the overseas media as the front line in the battle for public opinion. People trying to livestream the protests and foreign media are apparently already being targeted by the police. In recent weeks, a BBC journalist was saved from injury only by his face mask, which shattered when the police shot directly at his head. Another reporter wearing a bright yellow press vest was crushed against a wall by three police officers. Two journalists were attacked by a gang of street thugs, and a well-known British livestreamer scratching his belly was publicly accused by a pro-Beijing politician of being a “foreign commander” sending hand signals to protesters. Such an accusation would be laughable had it not been so widely shared.
To counter what they say are lies and malicious distortions, the protesters have started to hold regular news conferences, with their representatives addressing the media wearing face masks and yellow helmets. The movement’s social media strategy has been to use colorful memes and videos tailored for different audiences, including large-print messages with floral backgrounds for elderly readers.
In recent days, the state-run Chinese media has begun sharing videos showing large-scale exercises featuring the People’s Armed Police, a paramilitary group, in the city of Shenzhen, over the border from Hong Kong. The same group, instead of the People’s Liberation Army, was used to crack down on protests in Chengdu in 1989. Hong Kongers may dismiss these provocations as bluffing, but it is a clear sign that the information war, like the battle for Hong Kong itself, is set to escalate further.

Hong Kong’s Protests Could Be Another Social Media Revolution That Ends in Failure,"Building a movement was easier than finding a way to negotiate a compromise without leaders.
HONG KONG — Pay attention to Hong Kong. The three months of protests here speak volumes about the state of democracy today — how the human quest for freedom can’t be snuffed out, even by the most powerful autocratic systems, and how hard it is to turn that quest into lasting change in the age of Twitter when everyone is a leader, a follower, a broadcaster and a critic, and compromise becomes nearly impossible.
Yes, Hong Kong reminds us that people — God bless them — have both bodies and souls. And the great mistake that autocrats regularly make is thinking that they can thrive indefinitely by feeding just the first and not the second.
While the Hong Kong protests have been fed by many grievances, including income gaps and shortages of affordable housing, the hot molten lava of this volcano is that many Hong Kongers self-identify as free men and women and they viscerally reject the ruling bargain the Communist Party has imposed on mainland China and would like to impose on Hong Kong: To get rich is glorious, but to speak your mind is dangerous.
Why do Hong Kongers feel compelled to assert their identity as a free people now? It’s because anyone who visited China over the last 30 years knows that it is so much more open today than it was three decades ago — and it is so much more closed today than it was five years ago.
The anticipated and hoped-for trend toward more openness in mainland China has been aborted and reversed since Xi Jinping came to power in 2013, when he cracked down on both corruption and even mild dissent, and then, in 2018, made himself president for life.
That unmistakable cold breeze from Beijing, where people now don’t even whisper dissent, with cameras and microphones everywhere, has wafted down to Hong Kong. And the youth here in particular are pushing back with a don’t-think-for-a-second-that-you-can-bring-that-muzzle-here ferocity. That’s not who we are!
One protest banner said it all: “Sorry for the inconvenience. We are fighting for the future of our home.”
Bonnie Leung, a Hong Kong district counselor and an activist in this protest movement that proudly proclaims that it has no leader, put it to me like this: When Hong Kong was directly ruled by Britain, a democracy, “we knew their political system and that they were just not sharing it with us. With China, we know their system and we want protection from it. We can’t live in a society where people like Liu Xiaobo” — the Chinese Nobel Peace Prize winner and democracy activist — “could be arrested and die in jail.”
After a decade of democracy being snuffed out around the world, Hong Kong is part of a fragile but unmistakable counter-trend seen in places like Russia and Turkey, where people are using any sliver of freedom of expression or vote to push back on the humiliation of being silenced or bought off by dictators. Just when you think people’s souls have been crushed, they’ll still surprise you.
But working against that is another global trend apparent here: the contradictory effects of social networks on political movements. Facebook and Twitter make it much easier to get lots of people into the streets fast. But when everyone has a digital megaphone, it is much harder for any leader to aggregate enough authority not just to build a coherent set of demands but, more important, to make compromises on them, at the right time, to transform street energy into new laws.
So, the Hong Kong protesters proudly proclaim they have “no leader” and insist on their five crowdsourced demands — and “not one less.” Those demands include universal suffrage to elect the city’s administrators, an investigation of police brutality and amnesty for arrested protesters.
But no movement will get 100 percent of what it wants, especially in Hong Kong, which is actually one country, three systems. There’s Beijing, the sovereign power. There’s the conservative pro-Beijing Hong Kongers, who dominate the local administration and accept the limited democracy rules inherited from Britain. And there’s the more urbanized, full-democracy-aspiring, internet-savvy youth in the streets.
The only possible outcome is a compromise. But as the South China Morning Post columnist Alex Lo argued in a Sept. 11 article, Hong Kong protesters are being hobbled by the same social networks that got them their large crowds: Because there is no leadership, there is no ability to cut a deal, and anyone who tries to compromise will get torched online. These modern movements are crowdsourced but also crowd-enforced, and that’s intimidating for anyone who wants to make a deal.
“Worldwide trends usually take a few years to reach Hong Kong,” wrote Lo, and “our social media-driven revolution that has fueled the current unrest is no exception. … But from Gezi Park in Istanbul to Tahrir Square in Cairo, revolutions and rebellions driven by social media have all ended in failure.”
Because Hong Kong’s protests “encompass and amplify practically every major grievance people have about their government, society and China,” Lo added, “it’s impossible to bridge disagreements and present a viable political program. The only common denominator, the lowest, is that everyone hates China.”
My view: Social networks and cybertools are making inefficient authoritarian regimes more frail, because the people now have more tools to communicate and take on the state. See: Egypt, Jordan, Turkey and Russia. But they’re making efficient authoritarians even more efficient. See: China. And they are making democracies ungovernable, because they not only facilitate the “end of truth” but also “the end of compromise.” See: America, Brexit and Hong Kong.
To compromise means, at a maximum, to forge new common ground, to find areas of overlap, where opposing sides can stand together and, at a minimum, each side takes a little less of what it wants in order to just coexist. But both are becoming harder under the intense pressure of online-enabled extremists.
As my Times colleague Keith Bradsher has noted, the last time major street protests in Hong Kong broke out was in September 2014 — ironically after an Aug. 31, 2014, decision, approved by Beijing, to give the people of Hong Kong more say in how they chose their leaders.
At that time (and still today), a 1,200-member electoral committee, stacked with Beijing loyalists and more conservative farmers, businessmen and fishermen, chose the city’s chief executive. Beijing proposed on Aug. 31, 2014, to shrink that committee’s power to only choosing the candidates who could run — so no one overtly hostile to Beijing could take office — but then allowing all Hong Kongers to vote on the candidates.
It was not an awful compromise because even if Beijing controlled what names would be on the ballot, whoever would win the voting would likely be candidates who promised Hong Kongers the most democracy. In the current system, the winner of the most votes among the chosen 1,200 electors is often whoever makes the most promises to Beijing to twist the arms of Beijing’s friends in Hong Kong.
The compromise was rejected by the street in 2014 and it set off a two-month occupation of several Hong Kong neighborhoods, known as the “Umbrella Movement.” It demanded a “one man, one vote” system, with no obstacles on who could run — the only way to truly protect Hong Kong’s unique democratic identity.
I have huge admiration for the courage of Hong Kongers to defend their city’s unique character. But my head says that “perfect” is rarely on the menu and that better is good when facing an overwhelming power like Beijing. Imagine that the Aug. 31, 2014, compromise had been accepted. Mainland Chinese would be watching Hong Kongers vote directly for their leaders — albeit from a limited list — compared with mainlanders who can’t do even that.
“By insisting on all or nothing, the pan-democrats squandered a good opportunity to bring Hong Kong closer to the ‘true democracy’ to which they rightfully aspire,” observed the Hong Kong investor and writer Weijian Shan, the author of “Out of the Gobi, My Story of China and America.”
Had Hong Kongers accepted the Aug. 31, 2014, offer of limited universal suffrage they’d be in a much stronger position today to demand the full deal. Now it’s unclear if Beijing or its Hong Kong allies will offer even this limited universal suffrage — or if this democracy movement could compromise on it.
So, when the tear gas smoke clears, two huge questions will still linger. Is “better” — the 2014 compromise — still on the table? And, if it is, is there a protest leadership that can say yes to it and make it stick?

Hong Kong’s Retreat Chips Away at Xi Jinping’s Iron Image,"BEIJING — China’s leader, Xi Jinping, was in Tajikistan on Saturday, celebrating his 66th birthday with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, when the political crisis in Hong Kong took a dramatic turn with an unexpected retreat in the face of mass protests.
Mr. Xi’s trip fortuitously gave him some distance from the events in Hong Kong, where the leadership on Saturday suspended its push for legislation to allow extraditions to mainland China. But the measure had been backed by Beijing, and there was no mistaking that the reversal was a stinging setback for him.
The move, the biggest concession to public pressure during Mr. Xi’s nearly seven years as China’s paramount leader, suggests that there are still limits to his power, especially involving events outside the mainland, even as he has governed with an increasingly authoritarian grip.
“This is a defeat for Xi, even if Beijing frames this as a tactical retreat,” said Jude Blanchette, a consultant and the author of a new book on the revival of revolutionary ideology in the country, “China’s New Red Guards.”
On Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people marched again in Hong Kong despite the government’s concession a day before, insisting that the legislation be withdrawn while making new demands, including for an investigation into the use of excessive force by the police in clashes with protesters. The large turnout was a surprise, and it means the crisis is not over for Mr. Xi. Given how he has consolidated power in China, he may find it increasingly difficult to avoid blame.
The risk for Mr. Xi is not limited to Hong Kong. Though he has no visible rivals, he may face criticism in the leadership. And the mainland government’s censors, at least, are clearly concerned that the extraordinary events might inspire Mr. Xi’s beleaguered critics in mainland China, and they have been working vigorously to block the news from spreading.
[Protesters in Hong Kong once again  took to the streets  on Sunday.]
“This further chips away at the image of Xi as an all-powerful, omnicompetent and visionary leader,” Mr. Blanchette added.
The demonstrations also made clear that after 22 years, Beijing has had minimal success in weaving Hong Kong into the country’s central political, economic and security systems, all dominated by the Communist Party. But if Mr. Xi and his cadres want to proceed more forcefully to bind Hong Kong to the mainland, they must also see how that could invite new waves of protest.
“This is an important time to see whether Xi is a rigid ideologue like Mao or the pragmatist that previous Chinese leaders like Deng, Jiang and Hu were,” said Susan L. Shirk, the chairwoman of the 21st Century China Program at the University of California, San Diego, referring to Mr. Xi’s predecessors.
As evidence of a pragmatic tinge, she cited recent adjustments that Mr. Xi made — at least cosmetically — to his signature “One Belt, One Road” international infrastructure initiative following criticism that it was ensnaring countries in indebtedness to Beijing.
“Pragmatic leaders adjust their policies when they become too costly,” she said.
Still, the controversy over the legislation has hardened views around the world toward Mr. Xi’s China, particularly regarding the lack of judicial independence or basic rights for defendants plunged into the Chinese judicial system.
The idea of a law that would allow transfers of criminal suspects into the Communist Party-controlled system provoked fear among Hong Kong’s seven million residents, including business executives, consultants and investors who have made the city a global hub of finance, trade and transportation.
“The proposed law, the protests and the Hong Kong government’s response has heightened international awareness of the repressive policies of the Xi era,” said Anne-Marie Brady, a professor at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, adding that China was not living up to its pledge to honor Hong Kong’s autonomy for 50 years after the 1997 takeover.
During Mr. Xi’s four-day trip for previously scheduled summit meetings in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, the events in Hong Kong were portrayed in China’s state media not as a retreat but as a well-considered move receiving Beijing’s full support.
“Sometimes we have to be on duty on our birthday,” Mr. Putin told Mr. Xi in a carefully choreographed exchange at a hotel in the Tajik capital, Dushanbe, even as Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, prepared to announce the suspension of the legislation.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Mr. Putin presented the man he has taken to calling a dear friend with a decorative vase, a cake and an entire box of ice cream that Mr. Xi had previously pronounced as the most delicious in the world.
Mr. Putin’s party for Mr. Xi was broadcast on China’s state television network, which had not even mentioned the protests in Hong Kong — some of the largest since Britain handed over the territory in 1997 — until Friday night. It described them as riots sponsored by foreign actors.
Both men are of similar age and temperament, sharing an abiding fear of foreign efforts to undermine their rule. Both have experienced the simmering fury of constituents nonetheless, suggesting that popular sentiment still plays a role in the era of strongman leaders. Mr. Putin, too, had to bow to public pressure last week following protests over a false arrest of a prominent investigative journalist, Ivan Golunov.
In the end, Beijing and Hong Kong decided that they already faced enough challenges with the economic headwinds and trade tensions with the United States heading into the Group of 20 summit meeting in Japan this month, according to a person in Hong Kong with a detailed knowledge of local policymaking, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivities inflamed by the protests.
President Trump and Mr. Xi are expected to meet in less than two weeks at the summit, in Osaka, although formal trade talks between them have not yet been confirmed.
Mr. Xi has never publicly commented on the Hong Kong matter, but two of the seven members of the governing Politburo Standing Committee that he presides over — Wang Yang and Han Zheng — expressed their support for the legislation.
On Friday, a vice foreign minister in Beijing summoned the deputy chief of mission at the American Embassy to complain about a congressional bill, drawn up in support of the protesters, that called for a broad review of Washington’s relationship with Hong Kong.
The suspension of the legislation — which stopped short of dropping it altogether — has fueled concerns that Mrs. Lam’s retreat was a tactical one, probably endorsed at least tacitly by Beijing. She met with senior Chinese officials on Friday before announcing her decision the following day, a person with knowledge of the government’s policymaking said. She declined to comment on Saturday on any private meetings she might have had.
Mr. Xi is not prone to concession or compromise, especially when under threat, as Mr. Trump has learned during his public efforts to negotiate an end to the trade war. This latest setback, analysts said, could be merely temporary.
“Postponement is not withdrawal,” Ryan Hass, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who served as the director for China at the National Security Council during the Obama administration, wrote in an email. “Beijing likely will be willing to let Lam take heat for mismanaging the process of securing passage of the bill, bide its time, and wait for the next opportunity to advance the legislation.”

Hong Kong’s Hard-Core Protesters Take Justice Into Their Own Hands,"HONG KONG — When protesters in Hong Kong this weekend came upon an older, shirtless man who was threatening a crowd, they pounded him to the ground with a stick. When a taxi swerved into a group of protesters nearby, some dragged the driver out and beat him until he was covered in blood.
And a few blocks away, protesters punched a Hong Kong actress who has publicly supported the police — apparently because she had been taking photos of protesters who were vandalizing a bank.
“Go back to the mainland!” the protesters yelled as she left the scene.
A confrontational core of Hong Kong’s antigovernment protesters have acted with greater ferocity in recent weeks, attacking individuals and smashing and torching storefronts, banks, cafes and subway entrances. In a strikingly personal affront, one group even delivered a severed pig’s head to a police officer’s wedding banquet.
For months, the protests, which began out of anger toward a proposed extradition law but broadened to encompass a variety of demands, have been largely peaceful, but violence now regularly overshadows events.
[ Here’s a timeline of how Hong Kong’s protests have progressed and evolved .]
The hard-line protesters see themselves as being forced to mete out justice in a system that lacks accountability and in the face of a government they deem unresponsive. Much of the violence has been fueled by anger over police conduct, made worse after an officer shot a teenage protester in the chest with a live round during clashes on Oct. 1, the politically sensitive anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.
But to their critics, these protesters are crossing the line by playing the role of vigilantes to punish those they consider their foes. The intensity of the unrest could alienate moderate supporters and members of the public, and play to Beijing’s depictions of the movement as the work of riotous mobs.
“Some people began to take matters into their own hands,” said Ma Ngok, an associate professor of government at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. He pointed in part to the protesters’ frustration that the police have in large part failed to arrest and prosecute pro-government thugs who attacked demonstrators.
Yet, he added, in recent days, the movement has been debating whether such retributive violence is morally justifiable.
The protesters describe vigilante attacks as “settling matters privately,” or “si liu” in Cantonese. On internet forums where rallies and gatherings are organized, some posts calling on the protesters to return punches have gained traction on the ground.
In their effort to retaliate against perceived injustices, hard-line protesters see few actions that are off limits.
A group of them showed up last month at a hall where an off-duty police officer was holding a wedding banquet and delivered a severed pig’s head. They also set off an ear-piercing fire alarm and tossed fake money at guests, turning a Chinese funeral custom into a deep insult.
One of the protesters who was there, Edward Hui, 20, said in an interview that the harassment is justified because the police are getting away with what the protesters see as excessive brutality.
“This sends a message to the police that, even if they are not held accountable by the system, they will be punished in their daily lives, and their loved ones too,” he said.
The decision by Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, on Friday to invoke emergency powers to ban the use of face masks at protests has only further angered the protesters, who see it as the latest example of eroding freedoms in the semiautonomous territory. Many who attended rallies on Sunday wore masks in defiance of the ban.
In the Mong Kok neighborhood on Sunday night, two men in masks who looked to be in their 20s or 30s punched a shirtless, older man who was standing in the street and arguing with a crowd.
The man tried to walk away after being hit at least three times — in the face, neck and jaw. But another masked attacker struck him on the back of the head with a stick, knocking him to the ground, and hit the man again.
In another confrontation, video footage circulating online showed a group of protesters pulling a taxi driver out of his car and beating him bloody after his vehicle had accelerated with a sharp swerve into a crowd.
Some protesters formed a circle around the driver in an apparent effort to protect him, but by then he was already bleeding profusely from his head. At least one protester was reportedly injured by the swerving car.
“Rioters blatantly launched brutal attacks on ordinary citizens yesterday,” the police said in a statement on Monday, referring to the beating of the taxi driver and other confrontations that day. “Such acts of violence by far overstep the moral boundaries of any civilized society.”
The protesters have also begun setting more and more street blazes, which send plumes of black smoke swirling through Hong Kong’s urban canyons. Bonfires at the entrances to subway stations have been set to show anger at the transportation network’s perceived support for the government. The fires have added a sharp edge to a slogan from the “Hunger Games” movies — “If we burn, you burn with us” — that the movement appropriated months ago as a challenge to the city’s political elite.
Many protesters and organizers have avoided overtly criticizing violence on the part of the demonstrators, asserting that any fracture in their unified position weakens their influence. But there were signs that more demonstrators were concerned that the escalation in violent tactics, even if justified to many, would undermine the movement.
On Sunday, a post on the Reddit-like forum LIHKG, used by protesters, urged demonstrators to resist the incitement to violence. The post, which was upvoted over 1,800 times, asserted a theory that internet commentators paid by the Chinese government could be pushing protesters to adopt extreme tactics to try to sow divisions within the movement and erode public support for it.
Another popular post in the early hours of Monday suggested that the protesters should dial down the use of violent tactics and stop their acts of vandalism. That post was also heavily endorsed.
But there are signs the public might be growing more tolerant of violence.
The Chinese University of Hong Kong conducted a survey of more than 600 people that found that the proportion of people who believe that protesters should uphold the principle of nonviolence had fallen to 70 percent in early September from 83 percent the month before. More than half of the respondents said that they could understand the use of extreme tactics by protesters when the government was seen as having failed to respond to public demands.
Wong Siu-fan, a 25-year-old logistics worker who has participated in several peaceful protests, said he believed the hard-line protesters were usually justified in turning to violence, but he was worried about its escalating frequency.
“It could make a lot of people feel that the protesters’ goal is no longer to resist the government, but to vent,” he said. “I’m not optimistic because the government is pushing protesters to extremes, and then afterwards using their actions to stigmatize them.”

"With Troop Buildup, China Sends a Stark Warning to Hong Kong","SHENZHEN, China — The Shenzhen Bay Sports Center rises along the shore with the green hills of Hong Kong visible across the water. It normally bustles with a variety of youth sports programs and dance, art and language academies, including one that advertises a “Hong Kong Style Education.”
In recent days, however, it has become a staging ground for olive-green military transports and armored personnel carriers that arrived on Aug. 11 and disgorged hundreds of security officers from the People’s Armed Police, a Chinese paramilitary force, who are loudly running through daily exercises and drills.
By massing the troops within view of Hong Kong, the semiautonomous territory convulsed by protests, China’s Communist Party is delivering a strong warning that the use of force remains an option for Beijing. It is also a stark reminder that military power remains a bedrock of the party’s legitimacy.
“It’s a credible threat,” Minxin Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna College in California, said. “The Chinese government does not want to leave any doubt that, if necessary, it will act.”
China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has governed with an increasingly iron fist, including over the military. The deployment does not appear to be the prelude to a military intervention in Hong Kong, but few analysts expressed doubt that China would act if Mr. Xi believed the country’s sovereignty over the territory was jeopardized.
“How can he regard the Hong Kong movement as a pure democratic movement?” Tian Feilong, executive director of a research institute on Hong Kong policy in Beijing, said in an interview. Mr. Xi is likely to perceive the protests not just as a call for democracy in Hong Kong, but also as an effort to topple the Communist Party itself, he said. “He is very politically alert.”
Mr. Xi’s government, he said, has most likely completed preparations for an intervention but is holding off as long as the local authorities manage to keep the protests contained. That calculus could change, he and other analysts said, if the protests succeed in crippling the government or other institutions, like the courts, which will soon begin hearing the first cases of those arrested in the demonstrations. In what some observers see as a worrying sign, officials in Beijing have called the protesters’ actions “close to terrorism.”
The use of force, however, would be fraught with risks for Mr. Xi, who is already juggling economic headwinds and deteriorating relations with the United States under President Trump.
The country and the party are still haunted by the use of the People’s Liberation Army to crush the Tiananmen Square protest movement 30 years ago this summer, which resulted in international isolation and sanctions. A military crackdown could spell the end of Hong Kong’s role as an international financial center and the unique political formula under which Beijing grants the territory freedoms unseen on the mainland.
“The military solution would have many urgent and disruptive effects,” said Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing. “It would be political suicide for the Communist Party of China and the ‘one country, two systems’ arrangement of Hong Kong.”
More nationalistic voices have brushed aside such fretting, noting that China is a much stronger and diplomatically confident nation than the one that endured international opprobrium after the Tiananmen crackdown.
“The Hong Kong matter will not be a repeat of the political disturbance of 1989,” Global Times, a Communist Party newspaper, wrote Friday in an editorial, referring to the year that military troops in Beijing crushed the Tiananmen protests. It said Beijing had not decided to use force to intervene in Hong Kong, but had the legal right to do so if needed.
“Washington will not be able to intimidate China by using the turmoil 30 years ago. China is much stronger and more mature, and its ability to manage complex situations has been greatly enhanced,” the editorial said.
The deployment in Shenzhen was clearly meant to focus attention in Hong Kong and beyond. A white bridge that connects Shenzhen to Hong Kong is only two miles down the road.
The message was amplified by no less than Mr. Trump, who disclosed on Twitter that American intelligence agencies had spotted the Chinese troops massing at the border. “Everyone should be calm and safe!”
It remains to be seen how effective Beijing’s posturing will be. The authorities have from the start misjudged the depth of the anger driving people into the streets. While the deployment and increasingly blunt warnings from officials have rattled nerves, they seem to have had little impact on those who view the struggle as one crucial for preserving Hong Kong’s freedoms.
The growing threats of military action came as violent clashes have escalated. Public anger on the mainland spiked last week when protesters at Hong Kong International Airport tied up and beat two men from China.
Three days after protesters defaced the central government’s liaison office in Hong Kong with paint and graffiti on July 21, the chief spokesman of the Ministry of National Defense curtly noted that the People’s Liberation Army had the authority to intervene in the territory, if requested, to keep order.
The law that details relations between Hong Kong and the army limits its role to external defense, but allows it to intervene, when sought by Hong Kong’s leaders, to maintain public order or assist in cases of natural disasters.
The Hong Kong garrison of the People’s Liberation Army is based in what was formerly the British military headquarters. The garrison includes 19 sites around the territory, but many of its soldiers — estimates of the total vary from 6,000 to 10,000 — live and train in bases across the border in Shenzhen.
“Those who want to stir up unrest should know that Hong Kong has a P.L.A. garrison,” Han Dayuan, a law professor at Renmin University in Beijing, said during a government-organized news conference. “They should consider that for a moment when there is turmoil, there is also a need to resolve it quickly.”
The deployment of the People’s Armed Police, though, shows Beijing has options other than the army. The armed police force has a mission of maintaining internal security on the mainland, including responding to terrorist attacks, riots and rebellions.
It was founded in 1982 and has 1.5 million members, making it bigger than most militaries in the world. It has in recent years been deployed extensively in Xinjiang, where the government has harshly cracked down on what it views as the threat of Islamist extremism among Uighur Muslims.
As part of Mr. Xi’s efforts to streamline the military command structure, a core part of his consolidation of power since 2012, the People’s Armed Police was put last year under the leadership of civilian party authorities and the Central Military Commission, which he controls as its chairman.
Video of its deployment in Shenzhen appeared in China’s state media within hours of the arrival of the vehicles at the stadium on Aug. 11. The reports said the troops there were taking part in a drill across all of Guangdong Province.
The troops at the stadium appear to have settled in on its grounds. Backpacks and other personal equipment could be seen neatly arrayed in the stadium’s causeways, while officers milled about during breaks from drills, which could easily be heard, if not seen, from the streets around the stadium.
One officer, when asked, said the deployment was a summer training exercise.
There appeared to be little effort to disguise the activity. The People’s Daily posted a video late Saturday showing the force in Shenzhen standing in formation and conducting mock clashes with protesters wielding sticks. One officer with a megaphone warned in Cantonese, the dialect spoken in Hong Kong: “Stop the violence, repent and be saved.”
The exercises do not seem to have resonated in Hong Kong, suggesting that Beijing’s messaging could be falling short.
For now, analysts said, officials in Beijing appear willing to watch and wait, continuing to offer support for Hong Kong’s beleaguered leaders, to dangle carrots and sticks at business and cultural leaders, and to try to undermine public support for the protests. Giving in to the protesters’ demands would be an unacceptable sign of weakness for them.
Mr. Wu, the analyst in Beijing, said the government’s overriding goal now was “to prevent Hong Kong’s movement from spreading to the Chinese mainland.”
That effort at least appears to be succeeding here in Shenzhen, a factory town that kicked off China’s remarkable economic transition 40 years ago and that now has aspirations of being a global high-tech hub.
Two rivers and Shenzhen Bay separate the city from Hong Kong. So does a heavily fortified border with passport and customs checks at six crossing points. There is also a cultural and political gulf that has barely narrowed since Hong Kong was returned to Chinese control in 1997.
Shenzhen does not feel like a city mobilized for military action. Several people, when asked, said they had heard little of the protests, or declined to discuss them.
Others expressed support for Hong Kong’s police. Cathy Huang, who is 23 and works for an insurance company, said mainlanders attached “more importance to the police” than people in Hong Kong did.
“It is not that it cannot be solved by force,” she said in a shopping center a short drive from one of the border crossings. Her view starkly contrasted with that of many of Hong Kong’s protesters about excessive use of force, which has now become one of the complaints driving more protests.
“It depends on the attitude,” she said. “To a certain extent, we would even support the police adopting slightly harsher measures.”

"Cathay Pacific, Icon of Hong Kong’s Rise, Now Reflects China’s Grip","The airline agreed to bar employees who support or join protests from working on flights to mainland China, though it didn’t say how they would be identified.
HONG KONG — Two months of boiling antigovernment protests have divided Hong Kong’s people. Now, the unrest has pitted one of the territory’s best-known international brands against some of its own employees.
The Chinese government has forced Cathay Pacific Airways, a longtime emblem of Hong Kong’s proud status as a global capital, to bar staffers who support or participate in the territory’s protests from doing any work involving flights to mainland China. As part of the same demands, issued on Friday, it ordered that the airline begin submitting information about all crew members flying to — or above — the mainland to the Chinese authorities for prior approval.
Cathay said separately on Saturday that it had removed from flying duties a pilot who was charged with rioting in Hong Kong, and that it had fired two airport ground staff for misconduct. Earlier in the week, the airline said it would investigate accusations that its employees had leaked travel information for a Hong Kong police soccer team.
[ More than 150 flights at Hong Kong’s airport were canceled  on Monday as protesters flooded the main terminal.]
The orders from mainland air safety officials represent an escalation into Hong Kong’s business affairs, illustrating the power Beijing wields over international companies that build their fortunes on access to China. Some in the semiautonomous territory fear that China’s political encroachment also represents an economic threat, not only to Cathay, but also to all multinational companies in Hong Kong.
“If you’re a boss, you’re thinking, ‘Oh my God!’” said Carol Ng of the Hong Kong Cabin Crew Federation, a union that represents airline workers. “‘I just want to do business here. Now they’re screening my staff.’”
This kind of fear could do real damage to Hong Kong’s economy, Ms. Ng said, “much more than the protests or rallies themselves.”
Cathay representatives did not respond on Sunday when asked how exactly the company planned to enforce the new orders from Beijing. China’s aviation regulator was not available for comment.
The airline’s largest shareholder is Swire Pacific, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate with British roots. Its second largest owner is Air China, the state-run carrier. Cathay Pacific’s shares were trading about 4 percent lower early Monday in Hong Kong.
Cathay’s predicament underlines the economic pressures coming to bear on Hong Kong. Forecasters predict that the long-running protests on top of the trade war between the United States and China will weigh on the territory’s growth. Tourist visits have declined, and the Hong Kong stock market has been falling for the past several weeks.
Several Cathay employees interviewed by The New York Times over the weekend said that the company had not asked workers about their involvement in or attitudes toward the demonstrations, something that it would presumably need to do to stop them from working on flights to mainland China.
Still, the employees described an atmosphere of rising fear and anger in response to China’s demands, and of unease about how Cathay would carry them out.
“We are all so furious now,” said Sally Chu, a 28-year-old Cathay flight attendant. “We wonder how they can check on our activities and ban us, too.”
The airline, one of Asia’s largest international carriers, has already blamed Hong Kong’s recent turmoil for a drop in bookings. The controversy now threatens to test the company’s commitments to its employees against its own bottom line, which depends significantly on its ability to fly through mainland Chinese airspace.
The pilot whom Cathay removed from service, Liu Chung-yin, was released on bail after his arrest late last month. But the Chinese state news media noted that he had been allowed to continue flying, and warned that Cathay would “pay a painful price” for “tacitly encouraging antigovernment strikes.” Mr. Liu could not be reached for comment.
Other Cathay employees’ political activities attracted attention in mainland China after large numbers of the airline’s workers called in sick to take part in a recent general strike, which led to scores of flight cancellations.
Announcing the pilot’s suspension on Saturday, Cathay went out of its way to say that “we express no view whatsoever on the subject matter of any proceedings to which he may be subject.”
In a message to employees that day, Cathay’s chief executive, Rupert Hogg, said the airline planned to comply with the Chinese regulator’s new requirements. “Our primary focus must remain on delivering a safe, comfortable customer experience for everyone who chooses to fly with us,” Mr. Hogg wrote.
Just days earlier, the airline’s leaders had said employees’ political views were not their concern.
“We certainly wouldn’t dream of telling them what they have to think about something,” Cathay’s chairman, John Slosar, said at a news conference. “They’re all adults. They’re all service professionals. We respect them greatly.”
It is also unclear whether meeting the Chinese authorities’ demands will be enough to spare Cathay the wrath of Beijing’s propaganda machine. In a social media commentary on Sunday evening, the People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s mouthpiece, said that the airline’s actions had hardly resolved its “crisis.”
“Ground the flights that must be grounded, punish those who must be punished, rectify what must be rectified,” the commentary said. “In the face of such warnings, how can you joke around!”
Some Cathay workers said it might be for the best if they did not fly to the mainland after all, lest they risk being arrested or having their phones and other personal belongings searched.
“The airline must speak up and ensure the rights and personal safety of employees,” said another Cathay flight attendant, Karrie Chan, 24. “Otherwise I would feel unsafe even when at work.”
Cathay rose to pre-eminence by connecting Asia’s emerging economies to London, Los Angeles, New York and other centers of wealth in the developed world. Hong Kong prospered by connecting China to the global companies that wanted to do business there.
Today, though, more of those companies operate in mainland China directly, with less need for Hong Kong as a bridge.
And Cathay is now just one of many carriers linking East and West. China’s state-backed airlines can fly international passengers directly to and from the mainland’s megacities. The flag carriers of the Persian Gulf nations offer their own convenient routes to Asia for travelers from Europe and North America.
Cathay Pacific’s history is tied up with its home city’s emergence as a global hub in ways that date back to the company’s founding, in 1946.
The airline’s founders, Roy Farrell and Sydney de Kantzow, were pilots who had flown missions across the Himalayas to supply Nationalist forces in China during World War II.
After the war ended, Mr. Farrell, a Texan, bought a surplus transport plane with the dream of flying goods to China from Australia, according to “Beyond Lion Rock,” a history of Cathay by the journalist Gavin Young.
The Roy Farrell Export-Import Company’s inaugural voyage from Sydney carried “three and a half tons of clothes — for the tattered of China,” The Sydney Morning Herald reported.
Hong Kong at the time was in near ruin. Its harbor was cluttered with the wrecks of warships from the Japanese occupation, and air services were almost nonexistent. But as the British colony grew rich over the following decades, so did Cathay, transforming from a swashbuckling shoestring operation into a carrier of regional, then international, renown.
That the airline was British-controlled and flown largely by British and Australian pilots did not prevent it from becoming a source of pride for many people in Hong Kong — a respected global name associated with punctuality and good service.
The industry’s changing landscape began taking a toll on Cathay’s finances several years ago, and in 2017 the airline laid off hundreds of workers. It has since returned to profitability, although its image took another hit last year when it acknowledged that the personal data and travel histories of as many as 9.4 million people had been compromised in a computer breach.
Recently, Cathay bought Hong Kong Express, a low-cost airline, to help it better compete against budget upstarts in the region.
Cathay employees said over the weekend that they still trusted the company to treat its crew members fairly, and that concerns for their own jobs and safety were still outweighed by their desire to voice their convictions.
“The heavy-handed tactics of mainland China only make me feel that I must speak out so that they know how much we value freedom and democracy,” said Ms. Chu, the flight attendant. “Otherwise, they will only get worse.”

What Chinese Students Abroad Really Think About Hong Kong’s Protests,"While the battle lines seem clearly drawn, views are often less absolute and loyalties not so predictable. On Australian campuses, this uncertainty is producing a deepening anxiety.
SYDNEY, Australia — As tensions have swelled on Australian university campuses over the democracy movement in Hong Kong, the battle lines seem to have been neatly drawn: Chinese students on the side of China, and Chinese-Australian students on the side of Hong Kong.
But inside the halls, the reality is more complicated. Views are often less absolute, and loyalties not so predictably traced. Some students from mainland China shout their allegiance to their homeland; others privately voice sympathy for the Hong Kong protesters. Some conservative Chinese-Australians oppose greater autonomy for Hong Kong; others fear being lumped in with mainlanders they disagree with. Most feel a new glare of public scrutiny.
Australia has a particularly complicated economic and geopolitical relationship with China, a dynamic that shapes its views toward Hong Kong. As these issues now come to the fore on Australian campuses where international students are a large presence and a financial lifeline, students of Chinese descent say they are feeling a deepening sense of anxiety, leaving them unsure whom to believe and whom to trust.
Although clashes like the violent confrontation between Chinese nationalists and pro-Hong Kong protesters in July at the University of Queensland have received the most attention, what quietly pervades daily life, Chinese students say, are feelings of vulnerability to mistreatment and fear about voicing their true opinions.
“A lot of Chinese students here, they want to speak up,” said a law student at the University of Sydney and a supporter of the Hong Kong protests who requested anonymity because his family had received a warning from Chinese security officials. “But they don’t feel they’re safe to do that.” He added, “We don’t know who we can trust.”
Australia has been grappling for years with worries about its deepening financial reliance on China, and about meddling by Beijing in its government and other institutions. Both of these concerns have touched the nation’s universities, and last month the government announced the creation of a task force that will examine foreign interference on campuses.
There are about 150,000 students from China at Australia’s universities, as well as tens of thousands of Chinese-Australians. It’s a sizable block of tuition-paying students that, when combined with large donations from Chinese businesses and organizations, has redrawn campus life — from new buildings named for Chinese donors to conflicts over language, student politics and academic freedom.
In a country that barred Asian migration for decades, and where the power structure is still predominantly white, the flare-ups over Hong Kong have only added to the suspicion cast on Chinese students by some Australians.
“Most of them have adopted this view that Chinese international students are agents of influence,” said Alan Zheng, an Australian student of Chinese descent who believes that the narrative is going in directions that risk alienating Chinese students. “It’s bordering on racism.”
Jacky He, an engineering student at the University of Sydney who immigrated from China as a child and is the current president of the student representative council, said that singling out one ethnicity on campus was unfair. He pointed to the benefits for Chinese students of studying in Australia: Watching democracy in action on campus, he said, is like “opening a door.”
But when asked about the tensions over Hong Kong, he paused. “It will be very uneasy for people to talk about it,” he said. “No one really wants to get into a debate about whether your idea is right or whether your idea is wrong.”
The backdrop to Mr. He’s comments was a meeting of the student council where shouting broke out over a proposed symbolic motion supporting peaceful protests in Hong Kong and condemning police violence.
Clement Sun, a Chinese student, moved to open it up for debate. But before that could begin, another student, Yuxuan Yang, stood up and shouted an expletive at him in Mandarin. “If you do this, there will be consequences,” he said. “You are Chinese; you don’t even love your own country.”
As other representatives looked on in confusion, Mr. Sun responded: “I am Chinese. I do love my country.” Another Chinese student left the lecture room, briefly suspending the meeting.
Mr. Yang later said that he had made the comment to express his thinking on the matter, and that everyone was entitled to do so. “Hong Kong and China should not separate. That is my view,” Mr. Yang said.
Crystal Xu, the student who left, said that “it’s not that I walked out of the room because I didn’t want to hear the discussion.” She said she was worried that it would get physical. “I don’t want those kinds of similar things happening on our campus,” she said.
In interviews with more than two dozen Chinese students, several said that what they most wanted was a calm, reasoned debate on campus about the issues raised by the Hong Kong protests — a contrast with fiery portrayals in the news media.
But they acknowledged the difficulty of that, given the passions aroused by subjects like democracy, nationalism and sovereignty. They said that fear of retribution prevented them from voicing their opinions, and that universities needed to do more to protect them.
Many Chinese students sympathetic to the Hong Kong protesters said they were worried that they would face abuse from their peers, and that their opinions would be reported to the Chinese government. Some who support the Chinese government said they were afraid of being exposed to xenophobia in Australia. Others, confused by contradictory accounts in the Western and the Chinese news media, are discussing the subject among only the closest of peers.
“The simple narrative that Chinese students love China and Chinese-Australians love Hong Kong is simply wrong. There’s a much more complex mix of attitudes,” said Salvatore Babones, an associate professor and sociologist at the University of Sydney who works closely with Chinese students on campus.
The University of Sydney has long been a feeder for the nation’s top political posts; its alumni include seven prime ministers. As the Chinese student population has grown, many of the newest generation of leaders are Chinese students hoping to represent a contingent of overseas students that has traditionally been missing from student politics.
For Chinese students with more complicated opinions on their country, the discussion about Hong Kong comes with particular unease. One Chinese student pondering the potential of a democratic China stopped midsentence when another Chinese student sat within earshot. A student official said he had seen posts on WeChat threatening to report students dissenting from the pro-China stance.
“We don’t really differentiate the country, the culture, the people, the government. If you criticize one, you criticize all four,” said the mainland Chinese student whose family had been visited by Chinese security officials.
“Many people in China can vaguely sense the absurdity of their life,” the student said. “But it takes guts to face the reality of dictatorship. That is hard and frightening.”
Pui Cheung, an organizer of pro-Hong Kong protests at the University of Sydney who moved to Australia from Hong Kong as a child, said of Chinese students: “We should be trying to give them access to the truth. Let them make up their own minds.”
Universities, she added, should be protecting the ability of people to have “difficult conversations.”
In an open letter to students, Michael Spence, the vice chancellor at the University of Sydney, said that universities must be places where students can have “hard but respectful conversations — where misunderstandings are corrected, and assumptions challenged.”
But Max Choi, 23, a student from Hong Kong at Monash University who has helped organize protests in Melbourne, said that while universities “will keep us safe,” they will not say anything about what’s happening in Hong Kong “because they have a lot of Chinese customers.”
Carrie Wen, an editor at a student newspaper at the University of Sydney, said that several fellow Chinese students had asked her to amend a report on Chinese students’ removal of a board of sticky notes expressing opinions about the Hong Kong protests, known as a Lennon wall. The students said the article should include more of their views.
But many of her friends who attend pro-Beijing protests, she said, are not thinking a lot about politics. “They’re just thinking about self-identity,” she said. “They don’t mean to harm.”

"China’s Political Correctness: One Country, No Arguments","The Communist Party has spent decades preparing the people to defend a united homeland. Hong Kong’s protests show it has paid off.
Hong Kong’s protests have disrupted Yang Yang’s family life. Though the 29-year-old lives in mainland China, he was inspired by the demonstrations to write a song about freedom and upload it to the internet. When censors deleted it, he complained to his family.
They weren’t sympathetic. “How can you support Hong Kong separatists?” they asked. “How can you be anti-China?” His mother threatened to disown him. Before Mr. Yang left on a trip to Japan in August, his father said he hoped his son would die there.
Hong Kong’s protests have inflamed tensions in the semiautonomous Chinese city, but passions in the mainland have been just as heated — and, seemingly, almost exclusively against the demonstrators.
A pro-protest tweet by a Houston Rockets executive, Daryl Morey, ignited a firestorm of anger against the N.B.A., demonstrating the depth of feeling. Joe Tsai, the only N.B.A. owner of Chinese descent, said all of China — yes, more than one billion people — felt the same way.
“The one thing that is terribly misunderstood, and often ignored, by the western press and those critical of China is that 1.4 billion Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country’s sovereignty over her homeland,” he wrote. “This issue is non-negotiable.”
For Westerners, this is strange language. You don’t hear about the common feelings of 300 million Americans or 60 million Brits, especially in the era of Donald Trump and Brexit.
Yet, in China, there is some truth to it. Of course, it’s a vast country brimming with opinions. But the Communist Party has spent decades preparing the Chinese people for a moment like this. The stir over Hong Kong shows, in dramatic fashion, how successful it has been, and how the world could be shaped by it.
“As soon as the Communist Party pushes the patriotism button, Chinese will rise up like zombies to unite against the foreign forces, be it Japan or N.B.A.,” said Mr. Yang, the singer-songwriter. “They don’t always know why they’re against those things. In fact, many Chinese like Japan and the N.B.A.”
Until Thursday, when China’s internet minders dialed down the passions, the Chinese online world was filled with denunciations of the protests. Some Chinese people have even scaled the Great Firewall, China’s highly effective online censorship system, to post anti-protest messages on services like Facebook and Instagram that their own government doesn’t want them to see.
Their comments reflect a narrative that China’s top-down education system delivers from a young age. A united China, a country with a common purpose, can stand strong against outsiders, according to this narrative. A divided China could slip backward, losing decades of progress and plunging the country back into chaos.
Any Chinese person who has gone to elementary school or watched television news can explain the tale of China's 100 years of humiliation. Starting with the Opium Wars in the 19th century, foreign powers bullied a weak and backward China into turning Hong Kong and Macau into European colonies. Students must memorize the unequal treaties the Qing dynasty signed during that period.
There’s even a name for it: “national humiliation education.”
This narrative glosses over a lot of history, including the cruelty of Mao’s revolution, the starving of millions during Mao’s Great Leap Forward and the madness of his decade-long Cultural Revolution. When it does include the 1989 crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square, the protest and its aftermath is mentioned in one sentence and portrayed vaguely as a political incident.
These lessons and propaganda sound crude, but they work. For years, I regarded Chris Patten, the last Hong Kong governor under the British rule, as “a sinner condemned by history.” That’s what state media called him, especially after he approved spending heavily to build Hong Kong’s new airport, leading to accusations of waste. Today, I regularly use that airport, a marvel of modern transportation, as do millions of others.
Of course, my friends and I watched with great pride Hong Kong’s handover ceremony from Britain to China in 1997. Territorial integrity achieved!
At the graduate school of journalism at Columbia University in 2002, one American student told me about his trip to Tibet. I was so incensed by his remarks that I blurted out, “Tibet is part of China!”
For Westerners, perhaps one way to understand would be to read “Educated,” a memoir by Tara Westover about escaping her survivalist Mormon family in the mountains of Idaho. It has nothing to do with China. But her struggle to unlearn what her parents taught her felt familiar to me after I left China and began to learn its history on my own.
The rise of the internet and China’s opening were supposed to widen views there. Instead, the party is narrowing them more. Education officials over the past two years have been increasingly enforcing a widely ignored 2004 effort to make education even more Chinese focused.
In some middle school history books, the Cultural Revolution is described as “a detour in the Communist Party’s expedition,” rather than as a mistake. Some universities have replaced textbooks by Western academics such as Milton Friedman and N. Gregory Mankiw with books written under a program called “Marxist theory research and building project.”
Textbook publishers have cut back on essays by Lu Xun, a writer known for his acerbic criticism of the nationalist government in the 1920s and 1930s. They were once a mainstay of school texts, but some Chinese people have used his articles to criticize current events. One, about how Chinese people should welcome criticism from foreigners, was posted on the social media platform Weibo this past week after the N.B.A. debacle, then was pulled down.
Already, China has become more effective at delivering its message to its people. Slogans that I learned without much conviction more than 30 years ago — like “Without the Communist Party, there would be no China” — are making a comeback.
These lessons might seem removed from the situation in Hong Kong, where the protesters are mainly Chinese, not foreigners. But state media has portrayed the protests as foreign driven, sometimes identifying Western bystanders and journalists — including one working for The New York Times — as American instigators.
State media also portrays the protests as a push for Hong Kong independence from China, a direct effort to tap into those feelings of territorial integrity. That thought has echoed. Mr. Tsai, the N.B.A. owner, called the protests “a separatist movement.”
But only a fringe group of protesters support full independence from the mainland. The five core demands of the protesters don’t include it. It’s an important distinction, one that Mr. Tsai’s newspaper — The South China Morning Post, owned by Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant where Mr. Tsai is executive vice chairman — is careful to make.
For China, the big danger is that it will become even more intolerant of criticism and different opinions.
A Chinese blogger wrote this week that a renovation project at a top Beijing middle school was causing widespread health issues, giving students bloody noses several times a day. The reaction was strong, and strongly against him. Many students told him there was nothing wrong with their school and even if there was, it was none of his business. “He should have shut his mouth just like N.B.A.’s Morey,” wrote one commenter.
Mr. Yang, the singer-songwriter, said “all hell broke loose” after his family and members of his band learned that he supported the Hong Kong protests. His younger brother told him he was sick in his mind. Former classmates castigated him online.
“The Hong Kong protests have definitely made them a lot more patriotic,” he said.
Over the years, he had tried to show people around him the videos of the Tiananmen Square crackdown and other events. His family told him that he should look at the brighter side of the history. The party has since provided education, jobs and pensions, they said.
“I feel as alone as an island,” he said. “I’m surrounded by very familiar strangers.”

"Hong Kong Police, Once Called ‘Asia’s Finest,’ Are Now a Focus of Anger","HONG KONG — The 30,000-member Hong Kong police force was long known as “Asia’s finest.” Then with the world watching, they tear-gassed and beat largely peaceful demonstrators and fired rubber bullets at them. Some officers appeared to hide their badges to avoid identification.
Now the force is struggling to salvage a reputation blighted by its behavior in the June 12 protests over a proposed extradition law that convulsed Hong Kong, the semiautonomous Chinese territory.
Faced with public fury over their crowd-control tactics, the police retreated and watched as thousands of young demonstrators besieged their headquarters for 15 hours last week, barricading the exits, throwing eggs and spraying graffiti on the walls.
Officers ducked their heads as protesters aimed laser pointers at them, and a police spokeswoman who urged the demonstrators to leave was drowned out by jeering.
“Dirty cops are becoming like dogs,” read a large banner that protesters unfurled in front of the Police Headquarters on Friday. “They’re learning to be the People’s Liberation Army,” it continued, referring to the military that serves China’s governing Communist Party.
Senior government and police officials have defended the department’s performance, saying that it is apolitical and merely upholding the rule of law.
But pro-democracy opposition leaders have increasingly targeted the police force, accusing it of defending a government that in their view is subverting the same rule of law it claims to uphold. They are seeking to turn the police into a potent symbol of how the Hong Kong authorities are accountable not to the public, but Beijing.
At first, the protesters focused their ire on the contentious bill that would allow extraditions to mainland China — and their huge demonstrations forced the city’s leader to suspend the legislation indefinitely. But many protesters, particularly students and people in their 20s, have in recent days directed their anger at the police’s conduct during clashes on June 12.
That day, the police were responsible for maintaining order and securing access to government buildings during a huge rally. But when some protesters hurled bricks and tried to storm the grounds of the legislature, officers fired tear gas on crowds that had few places to flee to and used rubber bullets for the first time in decades. Dozens were injured.
Videos circulating online of the clashes prompted many members of the public and human rights groups to criticize the police response as excessive and the arrests as capricious. They also noted that some riot police officers did not wear badges during the episode, perhaps to evade prosecution.
Now, front-line officers routinely face verbal abuse and profanity at protests, an unusual phenomenon for members of a body that had long been highly respected. Critics of the police’s conduct have created open-source databases in which users share officers’ phone numbers and the names of their spouses and high schools on social media, with some lists referring to the police as dogs.
Lam Chi-wai, the chairman of the Junior Police Officers’ Association, a police union, said the personal data of more than 400 officers and their families had been posted online, including his own.
“This is immoral,” he said in an interview. “There are people saying that bloodshed is needed to repay bloodshed, a tooth for a tooth. I’m shocked and saddened by this.”
Public anger against the police’s tactics swelled after the police commissioner, Stephen Lo, and the city’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, described the June 12 demonstration as a riot, which suggested serious potential legal ramifications for participants.
When nearly two million Hong Kong residents, by the organizers’ count, marched on June 16 against the extradition bill, many also demanded that the authorities rescind the riot label.
That rally prompted Mr. Lo to backtrack on calling the protest a riot, saying that anyone who demonstrated peacefully then should not worry about prosecution on rioting charges.
But that was not enough to quell anger against the police force, and protests continued. The police have since kept the riot gear aside and tried to negotiate with protesters, even when they swarmed the Police Headquarters on Friday, posing what Commissioner Lo described in an internal memo this weekend as a “major challenge.”
Some experts say the rift is inevitable in the former British colony where the police force has substantial paramilitary training. Britain built up the Hong Kong police in the 1960s to help control pro-Communist riots, experts said.
The police force was plagued by corruption in the 1960s and ’70s, but an anticorruption drive helped improve the force’s image by the 1980s. After Britain handed the territory over to China in 1997, Hong Kong was relatively peaceful for the first decade; and even a mass protest against Beijing-backed national security legislation in 2003 went smoothly.
But cracks began to show during pro-democracy protests in the territory in 2014 known as the Umbrella Movement, analysts and police officers said in interviews. At the time, the use of force against protesters, including pepper spray and tear gas in the early days of the standoff, set off larger demonstrations.
“Umbrella was a watershed,” said Gary Fong, a criminal justice expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The public “never thought the police would use tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters or students.”
Seven police officers were convicted of assault for beating a protester during the 2014 demonstrations. Some observers say this month’s heavy-handed police response to protests was motivated in part by lingering grievances within the force over those convictions.
In interviews, police officers and their supporters expressed frustration that Hong Kong officials and the local news media, as they see it, underplayed the violence on the part of the protesters.
“Even when the entire society is dissatisfied with the government, the police has no choice” but to maintain order, said Mr. Lam, the police union chairman. “For this we are often seen as an key part of the government, and so we are attacked.”
They also said that by appearing to backtrack on calling the incident a riot, Mr. Lo, the police chief, essentially shifted the blame from the force as a whole to individual officers.
“What the front-line officers did was to arrest people who participated in a riot — and now you say not everyone is a rioter?” a police officer said in an interview, referring to Mr. Lo, and speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisal. “People start to blame the officers, and it hurts their morale.”
Lawrence Ho, an expert on policing and criminal justice at the Education University of Hong Kong, said he was sympathetic toward the officers who had not acted with excessive force. “They actually are scapegoats of political arguments,” he said.
Andrea Tam, an accountant who supported the police in a rally downtown on Saturday, said the riot officers had done the right thing during the clashes with protesters.
“This is a civilized society,” Ms. Tam said. “We don’t tolerate uncivilized behavior.”
Last week, the police and a watchdog that monitors complaints against them, and whose members are appointed by the chief executive, both said they would investigate the tactics used against the protesters. But many protesters and pro-democratic lawmakers have called for a fully independent inquiry.
James To, a pro-democracy lawmaker and the vice chairman of the legislature’s security panel, predicted that any prosecutions of police officers would not come for at least nine months.
For many angry protesters, he said, “that will be too late.”

Can Hong Kong’s Courts Save the City?,"Don’t count on it.
HONG KONG — It both comforts and depresses me, as a lawyer who has practiced for four decades, that every day over the past few months I have been besieged on Facebook by anxious Hong Kongers urging me to take legal action to help protesters.
I have been asked to demand investigations into mysterious deaths, allegations that people have been raped while in police custody and claims that police officers have been impersonating protesters. Some people seek redress for police brutality. Others want to pre-empt the routine use of tear gas in crowded public transportation, old people’s homes, shopping malls, universities or the central business district.
That people come to me is comforting: It suggests that even though the government and the Legislative Council have failed us, Hong Kongers still believe in our judges. It is depressing because I fear that they will be disappointed.
Initiating litigation against the government, particularly in very political cases, is an uncertain and very expensive endeavor at any time. The government has unlimited money — the taxpayers’ money — to hire a large legal team, and so even if it loses a case in the first instance, it can appeal it all the way to the final court. You, the citizen, might have found lawyers to represent you for free, but should you lose, you may have to foot the government’s legal bill — in some cases, risking bankruptcy.
The odds are also stacked against you. Judges are conservative by nature and trained to give the establishment a wide margin of appreciation. They are not the ones fighting protesters on the streets; they are not the ones making the tough political decisions. They should be slow to criticize those in the hot seat for getting something wrong.
More ominous, in 2014, the Chinese State Council issued a white paper about governance in Hong Kong, which required, among other things, the city’s judges to be “patriots.” Way back in the summer of 2008, Xi Jinping — then China’s vice-president, now its president — called on the three branches of government in Hong Kong to “cooperate.”
For China’s leaders, law is a political weapon; they routinely refer to governing the nation “in accordance with the law.” This may sound like the same thing as “the rule of law,” but it is nothing like that: It merely justifies the rule of those in power and ensures that they are above the law.
If judges in Hong Kong issue a decision with political consequences that the Chinese authorities deem unwelcome, it can always be overruled by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, which is vested with the ultimate authority to interpret Hong Kong’s Basic Law, or mini-constitution. Let us not underestimate the tremendous pressure many of our judges have faced dealing with the highly sensitive and politically charged cases that have come to them in recent years.
Earlier this week, the police and anti-riot squads attacked the campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, firing hundreds of cans of tear gas and rubber bullets, and spraying parts of the campus with a toxic blue liquid. By Tuesday night, the university gym had been turned into a makeshift hospital, as though on a wartime battlefield. Joseph Sung Jao-yiu, a former vice chancellor of CUHK and a gastroenterologist, came with a team of doctors to help treat the injured — more than 110 people.
The police did have reason to take action that day: The CUHK campus is connected to a public footbridge that hangs over a major highway, and the footbridge was occupied by protesters who were throwing bricks and petrol bombs, blocking traffic and endangering the public.
Whatever the protesters were doing did not justify the authorities’ disproportionate response, however. Even CUHK’s current vice chancellor, Prof. Rocky Tuan, wasn’t spared being tear-gassed: He tried to defuse the situation with the police, but was told that he could not control his students and now was no time to negotiate. The clashes lasted for hours. Black mushroom clouds hung high above the campus and could be seen from a great distance.
Late Tuesday night, at the height of the confrontation, I was approached by Jacky So Tsun-fung, the president of the CUHK student union. He wanted to apply for an urgent injunction to stop the police from breaching the campus without a warrant and bar the use of crowd-control weapons without the assent of university authorities. Some students had become very emotional; word was circulating that one of them (and perhaps more) was considering suicide. But the judge declined to hear the application that night and wanted the police to be notified.
I met Mr. So the next morning. He has a shy, boyish face, delicate features and a mat of hair like a K-pop idol. The first thing I did was give him a big hug. His shoulders felt too small for the large burden he was carrying. I don’t mean just the burden of litigation; I mean the burden of being young in Hong Kong these days and daring to stand up or speak out. Young people are targeted, stalked and at risk of physical attack. Even secondary-school students in uniform have been stopped on their way to school, searched and harassed by the police.
There is no denying that violence has been committed by the protesters, too. But during our hearing on Wednesday, while the police’s lawyers wouldn’t tell the court how many tear-gas canisters officers had used at CUHK, they were quick to say how many petrol bombs had been thrown at them.
Never mind, apparently, my argument that at times as difficult as these, there is all the more reason to hold authorities accountable for any abuse of power. And that we, the public, are looking to the courts as our last safeguards. The judge dismissed our application.
And yet the Hong Kong courts have readily granted the police sweeping injunctions. There was one last month, cast in broad and vague terms, that barred anyone from “unlawfully and willfully” disclosing the personal information of police officers or their relatives. Naturally, no one was there to argue against the measure: Why did the court find it necessary to enjoin putative and nameless defendants from breaking the law?
Also last month, the government issued a regulation banning face masks at gatherings. Even as it insisted that Hong Kong was not in a state of emergency, the administration of Chief Executive Carrie Lam ordered the mask ban by invoking outdated, colonial-era emergency legislation — paving the way for more draconian measures in the future. Several legislators have challenged the regulation in court. A ruling is expected Monday.
Whatever the outcome of that case, it would be naïve at this stage to think that a few lawyers and judges can defend the rule of law in Hong Kong. Once the city’s pride, the rule of law cannot survive under the pressure of a government that does not respect fair play, freedom or democracy.

A Provocateur of the Hong Kong Protests Gains Growing Stature,"HONG KONG — From afar, the red brick sidewalk along King’s Road in Hong Kong appears to be covered with a mottled white carpet that stretches for dozens of yards. Closer up, the white reveals itself to be a mosaic made up of sheets of paper glued to the pavement, each featuring a bespectacled man with a self-confident smile.
The faces belong to Junius Ho, a local legislator, and this is not an election campaign gambit. It is a very public gesture of disdain.
In recent weeks, Mr. Ho’s image has been plastered on sidewalks and footbridges across the city, and its purpose is immediately apparent: to force pedestrians to walk on his face.
“He’s human trash,” said Stella Wong, 57, a school administrator as she gleefully tromped on Mr. Ho’s nose one recent afternoon. A teenage boy, dancing on his brow, spit out an expletive.
In a city roiled by months of protest and increasingly riven by political animus, Mr. Ho, 57, has emerged as one of its most polarizing public figures. A pro-China lawmaker whose rural constituency leans right, Mr. Ho gleefully antagonizes democracy advocates while emboldening those who favor a more hard-line government approach to the ongoing unrest.
His growing stature as a provocateur coincides with a new and potentially perilous chapter in Hong Kong’s increasingly fraught political drama. The leadership invoked emergency powers for the first time on Friday by imposing a ban on face masks, standard gear for the protesters. After another round of violent clashes overnight, the city settled into an eerie quiet on Saturday, belying the undercurrent of anger over the government’s decision.
Though Mr. Ho’s extreme positions are not shared by most pro-Beijing leaders in the city, he has become the standard-bearer of an incendiary brand of politics that has been gaining traction as the protests grow ever more violent. Such views could help reinforce the thinking of Chinese leaders who have largely misread the source of protesters’ anger, repeatedly underestimating the yearning for genuine democracy and the broader public’s support for the movement.
Mr. Ho, who spent the politically important National Day last week celebrating with top leaders in the Chinese capital, has demonized the protesters as “thugs,” generously praised the city’s embattled police force and openly advocates closer relations between Beijing and this semiautonomous city-state, which enjoys liberties unknown in mainland China.
He was also one of the earliest advocates of criminalizing the wearing of face masks during protests.
“Why have so many young people forgotten their roots and ancestry and disavowed their Chinese identity?” he asked during a recent interview with Global Times, a nationalistic, government-backed newspaper on the mainland. “I hope people from both sides stop now and behave the way Chinese people should behave.”
Mr. Ho certainly knows how to shock. He has called for advocates of Hong Kong independence to be “killed without mercy,” merrily welcomed intervention by Chinese troops to quell the unrest and uttered profanities against his political opponents in the Legislative Council.
Public rage against him mounted in late July, after a mob of men swinging wooden poles rampaged through a train station in Mr. Ho’s district, indiscriminately beating protesters, passengers and journalists, and leaving 45 injured. As the city was processing the spasm of violence, a video emerged of Mr. Ho glad-handing with the thugs and calling them “heroes.”
Mr. Ho said he was simply greeting his constituents, but he also suggested the perpetrators were trying only to protect their community from the maelstrom of political protest.
“Guarding your homeland is a very basic thing,” he said at a news conference he organized the next day, during which he pushed back against those who accused him of having a hand in the attack.
The demonstrations, prompted by a now-abandoned bill that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to the mainland, have morphed into a cri de coeur against Beijing and its efforts to chip away at Hong Kong’s hallowed freedoms. The leadership’s decision to invoke emergency powers for its mask ban only heightened fears about the erosion of civil liberties, prompting more violent protests and clashes with the police on Friday night.
Though Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has refused to concede to demands of free elections and amnesty for detained protesters, she and other pro-Beijing moderates have nonetheless tried to soothe tensions by avoiding strident rhetoric and appealing for dialogue.
Mr. Ho does not seem to be interested in kumbayas.
“The mainstream parties in the pro-Beijing camp still value civilized behavior, but Junius Ho doesn’t care if he alienates people in the middle,” said Ivan Choy, a political scientist at Chinese University of Hong Kong.
His political opponents are more blunt.
“This is how Mao started the Cultural Revolution,” said Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker. “Junius Ho is fanning the fires, which is unconscionable, but he seems to be seriously enjoying himself.”
Eddie Chu, a liberal legislator, echoed the sentiments of those who view Mr. Ho as a local proxy for China’s Communist Party, which regularly lionizes him in the state media as a defender of social harmony and Chinese dignity.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if we see more militant figures like Junius Ho in the next legislative council elections,” he said.
Mr. Chu has had a firsthand taste of that militancy. Two days after the train station attack, he and Mr. Ho sat side by side on a television news program to discuss the incident. It did not go well.
The two men shouted over one another and Mr. Ho became especially enraged by Mr. Chu’s refusal to support a ban on future protests. The show ended abruptly after Mr. Ho pounded the table, ripped off his microphone and stormed away while calling his legislative colleague a profanity. Later that day, Mr. Ho issued what sounded to many like a death threat on Facebook.
Mr. Ho did not respond to interview requests by phone, email and text message. But since his election in 2016, he has avidly courted media attention, often by staking out contrarian positions on social issues like gay marriage (opposed) or by organizing rallies to support the adoption of patriotic “loyalty” tests for Hong Kong judges.
Mr. Ho has his defenders, especially among those of an older generation who tend to be more conservative. And he can reliably count on voters in so-called indigenous villages whose residents trace their roots back generations. Robert Chow, a former journalist who leads the group Silent Majority, said Mr. Ho gave voice to those too afraid to openly express their love for China.
“Junius is a patriot who gives people hope,” he said.
The son of a police officer who became wealthy off land deals, Mr. Ho grew up in the New Territories, a large, lush expanse adjacent to the mainland that has faced issues with organized crime. After earning a law degree in the United Kingdom, he returned home to join his brother’s law firm. He says he is a Christian, and the part owner of an Australian-bred racehorse named Hong Kong Bet.
Mr. Ho is wildly popular across the border, with nearly 800,000 followers on Sina Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter. His followers on Twitter, which is blocked in China, number fewer than 300.
Mr. Ho’s ascension to the Hong Kong legislature was not without intrigue; he won his seat three years ago after a rival candidate dropped out at the last minute, claiming he had received death threats from men he described as mainlanders.
Among those Mr. Ho thanked after his victory was the central liaison office, the Chinese government headquarters in Hong Kong.
During a recent visit to Tai Wan Tsuen, an indigenous village adjacent to the station where the July attacks took place, many people were uninterested in talking about politics or Mr. Ho. Several claimed they were out of town or sick in bed the night of the bloodshed, though a few defended the attackers. One man, stepping out of his house for a cigarette, quietly praised Mr. Ho.
“He represents those who stay silent,” he said.
Mr. Ho’s antagonists have been anything but silent. In the days after the train station violence, attackers ransacked his district office and vandalized his parents’ graves. A few days later, the city’s Lands Department said the tombs violated zoning rules and suggested that Mr. Ho could be forced to excavate his parents’ remains and reinter them in a smaller plot.
Two weeks ago, the Hong Kong Jockey Club canceled Wednesday night races after word spread that Mr. Ho’s horse was set to run and protesters threatened to besiege the iconic racetrack. Mr. Ho’s response, perhaps tongue in cheek, framed the cancellation as a violation of his horse’s right to gallop. “Animals have their basic rights too,” he told reporters.
Still, the recent blowbacks appear to have left him undaunted. Late last month, Mr. Ho organized volunteers to “clean up” some of the city’s so-called Lennon Walls, the agglomeration of Post-it notes and posters that are a hallmark of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement.
And earlier this week, amid public outrage over the police shooting of an 18-year-old protester, Mr. Ho made it clear that he not sympathetic. “We don’t know whether those madmen are students or just thugs,” he said of the young protesters during a Facebook live video he broadcast from Beijing, “but all of them have been seriously brainwashed.”

"China Is a Minefield, and Foreign Firms Keep Hitting New Tripwires","The N.B.A. and others are finding it difficult to stay neutral in an increasingly politicized, and punitive, China.
BEIJING — For international companies looking to do business in China, the rules were once simple. Don’t talk about the 3 T’s: Tibet, Taiwan and the Tiananmen Square crackdown.
No longer. Fast-changing geopolitical tensions, growing nationalism and the rise of social media in China have made it increasingly difficult for multinationals to navigate commerce in the Communist country. As the National Basketball Association has discovered with a tweet about the Hong Kong protests, tripwires abound. Take the “wrong” stance on one of any number of issues — Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, for instance — and you risk upsetting a country of 1.4 billion consumers and losing access to a hugely profitable market.
Now, multinational companies are increasingly struggling with one question: how to be apolitical in an increasingly politicized and punitive China.
“You used to know what would get everyone fired up,” said James McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide. “And now you don’t know. You just wake up and discover something new.”
Until recently, the issues that made China angry were fairly predictable. The German company Leica Camera created a stir this year with a promotional video featuring the “Tank Man,” the unknown person who boldly confronted a convoy of tanks during the bloody 1989 crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement. (Leica says it did not commission the film.)
Around the same time, eagle-eyed Chinese internet users began calling out companies for not clearly indicating on websites, customer surveys and products that certain territories claimed by China, like Tibet and the self-governing island of Taiwan, were part of the country. Gap, Marriott, United Airlines and others were forced to make internal adjustments and, in some cases, apologize.
This summer, when antigovernment protests in Hong Kong began to heat up, such sensitivities reached new heights. And China lashed out more aggressively, in part because it was playing defense against growing global support for the demonstrators.
The N.B.A. has been in damage-control mode over the issue for days. On Friday, Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets, posted a message on Twitter that said: “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.” Not long after, Mr. Morey’s tweet was deleted and the league quickly began damage control.
But anger still simmered. Social media platforms like WeChat and Sina Weibo were flooded with messages declaring a boycott against the N.B.A., which has a huge fan base in China. On Tuesday afternoon, CCTV, the state broadcaster, canceled plans to broadcast preseason N.B.A. games. Previously, Tencent Sports, a popular sports broadcaster, had announced that it would stop all live streaming and coverage of the Houston Rockets.
“The N.B.A. has been in cooperation with China for many years,” Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a regular news briefing on Tuesday. “It knows clearly in its heart what to say and what to do.”
The league has also been getting flak in the United States for appearing to kowtow to China, prompting a longer, more reflective statement on Tuesday. While the N.B.A. commissioner, Adam Silver, continued to express the league’s “affinity” for China, he also said that it couldn’t regulate its employees’ speech.
For businesses, China’s national ire has tended to focus on a single issue, despite the changing targets: the country’s sovereignty.
This summer, Givenchy, Coach and Versace each apologized to China for producing T-shirts that seemed to identify Hong Kong, along with other places claimed by Beijing, as an independent country. They all stopped selling the clothes.
Navigating the potential for backlash in China’s commercial landscape now involves managing not just products, but employees and anyone else affiliated with a company.
As the pro-democracy movement took hold in Hong Kong this summer, Cathay Pacific Airways, the city’s flagship airline, came under immense pressure from Beijing to discipline employees who were sympathetic to the protesters. In a matter of days, Cathay’s chief executive was replaced and several employees, including a pilot, were fired.
On Tuesday, the American video game company Blizzard suspended a Hong Kong player and rescinded his prize money after he donned goggles and a respirator — items that have come to symbolize the protests — and called for the liberation of the city in a post-match interview. Blizzard is a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard, which is partly owned by the Chinese company Tencent.
In a statement on Tuesday, Blizzard said the player had violated a competition rule barring any act that “brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.”
“While we stand by one’s right to express individual thoughts and opinions, players and other participants that elect to participate in our e-sports competitions must abide by the official competition rules,” the company said.
The political land mines aren’t always easy to see.
The upscale jeweler Tiffany found itself at the center of a social media firestorm on Monday after posting an image of a model covering her eye with her right hand. To many Chinese internet users, the gesture evoked another symbol of the Hong Kong protests: a woman shot in the eye with what protesters say was a police beanbag round, whose image later appeared in countless posters and memes.
The photo posted by Tiffany had been taken in May, before the protests started. But it was a no-win situation for the company, which had already warned investors that it would be hurt by the drop in tourism amid the protests in Hong Kong, its fourth-largest market by sales. Mainland China is a much larger market, and the company has been rapidly expanding its presence there.
The photo “was in no way intended to be a political statement of any kind,” a spokesman for Tiffany said in an emailed statement, after the offending tweet was deleted. “We regret that it may be perceived as such, and in turn have removed the image from our digital and social media channels and will discontinue its use effective immediately.”
The backlash can go both ways.
In an effort not to run afoul of the mainland, Vans recently removed several entries from its annual sneaker design contest that alluded to the protests in Hong Kong. After that, several streetwear stores in Hong Kong pulled all Vans products from their shelves.
“Creativity is one of the keys to solving our social problems,” said Second Kill, a streetwear store in the Mong Kok district, in an Instagram post announcing its decision to stop selling Vans products. “Neither creativity nor public opinion can be erased.”
The N.B.A. on Tuesday appeared to temper its earlier apology over Mr. Morey’s tweet, seemingly to respond to criticism in both China and the United States.
For those “who question our motivation, this is about more than growing our business,” Mr. Silver, the league’s commissioner, said in a statement. He said basketball could be “an important form of people-to-people exchange that deepens ties” but noted that the two countries had different political systems.
“It is inevitable that people around the world — including from America and China — will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the N.B.A. to adjudicate those issues,” Mr. Silver said in the statement.
“However,” he added, “the N.B.A. will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on those issues.”

"For Hong Kong Celebrities, Supporting Protests Comes With a Cost","HONG KONG — As Hong Kong’s protests evolve into a struggle against the grip of authoritarian China, one of the city’s biggest pop stars has emerged as an icon of defiance. She has spoken at rallies, handed out voter registration forms at marches and stood on the front lines with demonstrators, urging the riot police not to charge.
Denise Ho, a Cantopop singer, is just one of many high-profile figures in the decentralized protest movement, but among Hong Kong’s celebrities, she is a rare breed. Ms. Ho threw her stardom behind the city’s pro-democracy movement five years ago and has since been paying the price — being barred in the lucrative mainland Chinese market.
Ms. Ho defended the recent protests after Monday’s destructive turn when a core group of younger protesters stormed the city’s legislative offices. That day, Ms. Ho left a peaceful march to join a crowd outside the complex that was cheering on the students, and was still there after midnight when hundreds of riot police officers moved in to disperse them, with some firing tear gas.
In 2014, Ms. Ho’s career had been taking off in China, and she had played more than 100 concerts there. Then she took part in a protest movement in Hong Kong that called for freer elections in the semiautonomous territory.
The Chinese government barred her from performing and scrubbed her music from the playlists of streaming websites. The blacklisting cut hundreds of thousands of dollars from her annual income, Ms. Ho said.
The ban only emboldened Ms. Ho, reminding her of the need to protect the freedom of speech and other civil liberties that set Hong Kong apart from the rest of China.
“For me, it is always about the people, for the people to be empowered and for them to believe that we can control our destiny,” she said in a recent interview.
But for other celebrities, whose careers have come to depend on the mainland Chinese market, Ms. Ho’s punishment served as the latest warning from the governing Communist Party that it has a low tolerance for political dissent. Most stars stay out of politics. Others have chosen to support Beijing, and have been rewarded.
“Most of these people have stayed silent,” said Ms. Ho, who has livestreamed her appearances at demonstrations, including one in which she appeared to be shoved by a police officer. “It gets really frustrating and of course lonely for the people, especially for the younger people.”
[Here’s what to know about Hong Kong’s evolving protest movement.]
From her privileged perch, Ms. Ho has given voice to Hong Kongers’ grievances across the world, speaking at the Oslo Freedom Forum, writing op-ed pieces and giving interviews. She is scheduled to speak to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva on Monday.
Yet few among Hong Kong’s performers have made public appearances at the huge protests of recent weeks against a bill that would allow extraditions to China.
It is a stark contrast to 1989, when Hong Kong was still a British colony in the midst of a golden era of entertainment and there was little in the way of a mainland Chinese market. That year, a star-studded list of Hong Kong entertainers turned out for a concert to support the pro-democracy student protesters in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. Jackie Chan performed, and the actors Andy Lau and Chow Yun-Fat called in to express their support.
In recent years, as nationalist sentiment in the mainland has grown and the economy has rapidly expanded, the authorities, companies and fans have frequently shunned performers who take stances that are seen to be critical of Beijing.
Aside from Ms. Ho, others blacklisted after the 2014 protests, known as the Umbrella Movement, reportedly also included Mr. Chow and Tony Leung Chiu-wai. Some stars found themselves shut out by fans and companies in the mainland. Job opportunities suddenly evaporated.
During the recent protests, several industry organizations, including the Hong Kong Film Directors’ Guild, issued statements demanding the total withdrawal of the extradition bill.
However, other than Ms. Ho, only a handful of individual entertainers, including the actor Anthony Wong Chau-sang and the Cantopop singer Anthony Wong Yiu-ming, have spoken out.
Some entertainers who only hinted at their support for the demonstrations have come under pressure to clarify their positions.
Miriam Yeung Chin-wah, a Hong Kong actress and singer, posted an image of the term “R.I.P.” on her Instagram, which many fans saw as a tribute to a protester who fell to his death last month. Ms. Yeung later deleted the post without explanation, prompting a wave of criticism from fans who accused her of bowing to mainland pressure.
Charmaine Sheh, a Hong Kong actress popular in mainland China, was subjected to a barrage of online attacks after she “liked” a post showing the anti-extradition protests on Instagram, which is blocked in China.
Ms. Sheh apologized soon after. “I was shocked when I later realized what was in the post,” she wrote on a Chinese social media site. “I, Sheh Sze-man, love the country and love Hong Kong!”
A few stars such as the actor Tony Leung Ka-fai and the singer Kenny Chung have publicly supported the police, whom protesters condemned for using excessive force when dispersing crowds.
“It’s a bit dangerous for us to come out today as public figures,” Mr. Chung said at a pro-police rally on Sunday. “But we are not speaking about politics — we are talking about justice.”
Others have pleaded ignorance.
Jackie Chan, the Hong Kong-born actor of “Rush Hour” fame, was in Taiwan to promote a new album last month, days after hundreds of thousands of people held a protest in Hong Kong to oppose the bill. When reporters asked about his views on the demonstrations, Mr. Chan said he had only just learned about them.
“I don’t know anything about it,” he said.
Anthony Wong Yiu-ming, 57, the Cantopop singer, is one of the few established artists who spoke out against the extradition bill along with Ms. Ho. He came out as gay in 2012 and said the experience encouraged him to break the industrywide silence about politics.
“I am a civilian first,” Mr. Wong said in a telephone interview, “then a musician and also a social activist.”
But speaking in support of the Umbrella Movement, which Beijing criticized as a national security threat, came at a high cost. Mr. Wong said he had lost more than half of his annual income that came from China, as well as partnerships with international brands.
“I’ve been singing for 30 years and I can afford to pay this price,” he said. “A lot of people would then become too scared to speak up or express themselves. This is the most chilling part of it.”
Ms. Ho said that choosing to speak out had been liberating. “I am feeling quite free,” she said.
On Friday night, the singer spoke to a rally of several thousand protesters and urged them to persevere despite the arrest of several demonstrators.
“We have to learn how to turn a short-term protest into a long-term resistance,” she said. “And we have to learn how to integrate our resistance into our daily lives.”

"‘Retake Hong Kong’: A Movement, a Slogan and an Identity Crisis","HONG KONG — He has been locked up for more than a year in a secluded island jail, but the bespectacled 28-year-old inmate, Edward Leung, is the closest thing Hong Kong’s tumultuous and leaderless protest movement has to a guiding light.
He coined the protesters’ most widely chanted and, for China, most subversive slogan; he helped pioneer some of the movement’s rougher tactics; and he gave voice to the idea at the heart of Hong Kong’s struggle, now in its 10th week, to avoid becoming just another Communist Party-run Chinese city.
The protests were ignited in June by anger at plans by the Hong Kong government to allow extradition from the former British colony to mainland China. And they have been freighted since with a host of other complaints about prohibitively expensive housing, unfair elections and alleged police brutality.
But at the movement’s root is a dramatic shift in identity since Britain pulled out in 1997. The increasing influence of the Chinese government on the territory in recent years — what the protesters see as encroachment — has galvanized a large majority of Mr. Leung’s generation to reject ties to mainland China and fiercely assert what a growing number see as a distinct and entirely separate identity.
“I’m a Hong Konger, not Chinese,” said Kapo Chen, a 20-year-old student who joined protests at the city’s airport, “Of course, my blood is Chinese, but I can’t control that.”
Pinned to her back was a piece of paper printed with the jailed Mr. Leung’s biggest contribution to the protest movement, a slogan now daubed on walls across Hong Kong, screamed by black-clad protesters who plunged the airport into chaos on Tuesday and chanted at orderly gatherings around the city.
Mr. Leung penned the slogan, “Retake Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times,” in 2016, shortly before he was arrested over his role in a street brawl with the police, while running for election to Hong Kong’s legislature.
But starkly different interpretations of what Mr. Leung’s words mean — an incendiary call to break up China or simply an appeal to defend Hong Kong’s core values — have highlighted a gulf between the two sides. The city’s Beijing-backed government is struggling against its foes not only for control of the streets but over what Hong Kong means as a place, a culture and a political entity.
Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, and Beijing officials have repeatedly denounced Mr. Leung’s slogan as a treasonous call for the city to split from China and overturn the formula of “one country, two systems” under which Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule.
But young protesters and their supporters note that the word they are using for “retake,” in Chinese, literally means “return to the light.” They insist that it is an appeal for Hong Kong to recover the freedoms and impartial system of justice that they believe have been steadily eroded.
Chu Hoi-dick, an elected member of the city’s legislative assembly and a protest activist who has visited Mr. Leung in prison several times, said the activist was never as recklessly militant as portrayed by China’s propaganda machine and has moderated some of his more radical views while in jail.
All the same, he described Mr. Leung as “the Che Guevara of Hong Kong’s revolution.” He added: “He has this aura about him and is an icon for the young.”
Mr. Chu, also known as Eddie Chu, 41, is also an early champion of Hong Kong’s “localist” movement, a cause focused on preserving the city’s sense of identity. He never agreed with Mr. Leung’s tactics, which sometimes veered into violence, but shares his view that Hong Kong must preserve its different identity rooted in the rule of law, generous freedoms and local traditions. For his part, Mr. Leung has called from prison for protesters to keep their heads and avoid stoking hatred.
The view that Hong Kong residents are not Chinese has dismayed not only the Communist Party but also some of its critics, who gather each year in Hong Kong for a candlelit vigil to commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen massacre in Beijing.
Many student groups have voted in recent years to stay away from the event “because they want absolutely nothing to do with mainland China” and are “focused on their own identity politics,” said Bao Pu, a Hong Kong publisher who is the son of a senior, liberal-minded Beijing official purged in 1989.
After a brief surge of patriotic feeling during the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, affection for and even interest in the mainland has fallen sharply, particularly after Xi Jinping became China’s paramount leader in 2012.
China’s harsh crackdown on Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in the nominally autonomous western region of Xinjiang has added to a grim sense of foreboding among many young people in Hong Kong.
“It is clear that since Xi got in power, China has been moving further and further away from all ideas of liberal democracy,” said Alan Tse, an anthropologist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who has studied the “localist” movement. “People in Hong Kong know that. They know that genuine democracy is very unlikely to come, so there is a wide sense of despair among young people.”
President Trump weighed in Wednesday night, writing on Twitter that he held out hope that Mr. Xi could resolve the situation peacefully.
“I know President Xi of China very well,” Mr. Trump tweeted. “He is a great leader who very much has the respect of his people. He is also a good man in a “tough business.” I have ZERO doubt that if President Xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem, he can do it. Personal meeting?”
A June survey by the Hong Kong University Public Opinion Program found that 75 percent of people from 18 to 29 years old identified themselves as a “Hong Konger” rather than “Chinese,” “Hongkonger in China” or “Chinese in Hong Kong.” That is a big rise from the 23 percent of this group who chose Hong Kong as their identity during the 2008 Olympics, and the 45 percent in 1997.
Older residents, many of whom were born on the mainland or have parents who were, identify slightly more with China. But of those 30 or older, 49 percent still identified themselves as Hong Kongers.
Chinese officials have long recognized they have a problem and have demanded that schools in Hong Kong introduce “patriotic education” classes to instill pride in China and sweep away what they see as a legacy of colonialism.
Before that, the British colonial authorities, worried about Hong Kong becoming embroiled in Chinese political battles, particularly the long feud between Mao Zedong’s Communists and Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist Party, tried to promote a sense of loyalty to the city rather than China.
These efforts increased after Communist-orchestrated riots and bombings in Hong Kong in 1967, when the colonial government began a campaign built around the slogan: “Hong Kong is my homeland.”
The post-colonial government has tried various ways to make Hong Kongers identify more with China, including a 2012 attempt, strongly backed by Beijing, to introduce “national education” in schools. But it backed off after street protests.
Until Beijing dug in its heels against concessions to the protesters, however, Mr. Leung’s call to “retake Hong Kong” was “the slogan of an irrelevant and infinitesimal minority,” according to Geremie Barmé, the editor of China Heritage, a journal focused on Chinese culture. The “obduracy of Hong Kong and Beijing hard-liners,” Mr. Barmé added, “turned it into the rallying cry of a generation.”
While Beijing and its allies in Hong Kong have revived a stiff lexicon last deployed during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, denouncing protesters as a “tiny handful of ruffians” who must be “resolutely stopped,” young activists have followed the advice of Bruce Lee, the Hong Kong martial arts legend, to “be water, my friend,” constantly shifting their tactics and message.
In tandem with pleas since 1997 to accept their new masters in Beijing, Hong Kong authorities have tied the city ever more closely to mainland China through infrastructure projects. But the increased flow of goods and people across the border has, if anything, only driven people on each side further apart.
Mr. Chu, the legislator and “localist” activist, led a series of doomed campaigns to block projects aimed at integrating Hong Kong physically more tightly with China, including a high-speed rail link that opened last year to the Chinese city of Guangzhou.
With new transport links came huge crowds of mainland visitors — 51 million last year — many of them speaking Mandarin instead of Cantonese, Hong Kong’s principal language. They irritated many locals by buying up supplies of baby formula and other products because they did not trust the quality of goods sold on the mainland.
A group called Hong Kong Indigenous, in which Mr. Leung was a leading activist, began harassing mainland shoppers in what it called “retake” actions. Hong Kong’s colonial-era flag became a banner of resistance in what at times became an ugly xenophobic campaign against mainlanders, with some Hong Kongers dehumanizing them as “locusts.” (Some pro-China activists have responded in kind, with one group this week spraying insect repellent on protest leaflets near Hong Kong’s Star Ferry pier.)
Support for declaring Hong Kong an independent country has remained a tiny, fringe cause. It exists largely as a trope in Communist propaganda, which has used it to tar protesters as traitors and curb any sympathies people in mainland China might have for the protests.
“Many think independence would be desirable, but 99 percent of Hong Kong people do not think it is feasible,” said Lam Cheuk-ting, a legislator for the Democratic Party who was injured during the July attack by gangsters.
“We are all Chinese here, but our culture, traditions and system are totally different from on the mainland,” he said. Young protesters “just don’t trust the central government and its puppets in Hong Kong.”
“They are very angry,” he said.
The standard-bearer for this anger, he added, is Mr. Leung.
Resembling an earnest young accountant more than a fiery revolutionary, Mr. Leung cemented his stature as a youth icon during his trial last year. He won widespread sympathy when the court handed down what many saw as an unfairly harsh six-year jail sentence for his role in what became known as the “fishball revolution.”
It began as a scuffle between street hawkers and officials trying to enforce a tough new policy cracking down on unlicensed traders and escalated into a violent melee.
Instead of denying any involvement, Mr. Leung admitted to throwing things at the police and apologized, saying he had only wanted to help the hawkers but “could not suppress his anger.” His admission struck many young residents as brave and honest.
His organization, Hong Kong Indigenous, never gained much traction beyond a fringe of disenchanted radical youth. But its warnings that Hong Kong was losing its special identity and must fight back have now found a new and far wider resonance as the authorities’ often tin-eared response to the unrest inflames the public mood.
“This movement is not about independence. It is about returning Hong Kong to a free place,” said Emma Chan, a 20-year-old protester at the airport. Mr. Leung, she added, “is not a hero but he inspired a lot of us to be interested in politics.”
“Many thought that politics do not matter,” she said. “They do.”

Can Hong Kong Avoid Becoming Tiananmen?,"This is not 1989 and Hong Kong is not Beijing, yet unarmed students are again in danger of repression by the Chinese military.
Thirty years ago, on May 19, 1989, Zhao Ziyang, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, stood in Tiananmen Square. It was 5 in the morning and Zhao, exhausted, holding a loudspeaker, addressed student demonstrators, thousands of whom were on Day 7 of a hunger strike. “Students, we came too late,” he said. “I am sorry. Sorry. Whatever you say and criticize about us is deserved.”
Zhao knew that Deng Xiaoping, the nation’s supreme leader, had planned to order the army to enter Tiananmen Square. Hoping to avert disaster, he begged students to give up their hunger strike. “All the vigor that you have as young people,” he said, “we understand as we, too, were young once. We, too, protested and we, too, laid our bodies on the railway tracks without considering the consequences. Finally, I ask again sincerely that you calmly think about what happens from now on. A lot of things can be resolved.”
The next day, martial law was declared and Zhao was placed under house arrest. Fifteen days later, the People’s Liberation Army entered Tiananmen Square, leaving carnage in its wake. Zhao died in 2005. His distinguished career has been erased inside China, his name deleted from public records and his face wiped from photographs.
At its most powerful moments, the 1989 demonstration brought together people from every stratum, bridging factory workers, state media, Beijing police, university and high school students, grandparents, professors and artists. Rock concerts filled the nights. A Democracy University offering free lectures was set up beside the newly raised Goddess of Democracy. Beijingers brought food and water to the demonstrators, and student marshals kept the peace, organized logistics, maintenance and cleaning of the public space. Professors and intellectuals, able to provide historical context, came to Tiananmen Square to advise on strategy, safety and vision.
The 1989 demonstrations were, in essence, an experiment in self-government because students understood that the way they protested would come to represent the demands themselves.
On the night of June 3, 1989, Liu Xiaobo and three other intellectuals, rushed back and forth between the protesters and the army, desperately negotiating safe passage for thousands of university students holding out in Tiananmen Square. Without their heroic interventions, those protesters faced certain annihilation. Liu never forgot those days and nights in the Square. His Charter 08 asked the government to uphold its own constitution. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 and died in 2017 while serving a lengthy prison sentence.
In the absence of a representative system of government, the Chinese Communist Party derives its moral legitimacy from acting in the best interests of the nation, with the approval of the people. Then and now, the greatest threats to the party are mass demonstrations that cut across class and political lines.
This is not 1989 and Hong Kong is not Beijing, yet young, unarmed students are once again in danger of repression by Chinese military power. Pro-Beijing politicians have irresponsibly compared demonstrators to terrorists. Young people, desperately concerned for an economic future inseparable from their constitutional rights, are putting their lives at risk.
Hong Kong’s protesters must be persuasive, flexible and unified, knowing they can never win by force. They need the greatest number of residents to support a specific and obtainable goal. Theirs is a delicate position, requiring a tactician’s genius. The region is a zone of transition between China proper and the Chinese sphere of influence, and its people reflect the complexity, ruptures and transformative changes of the Chinese world. A politically free Hong Kong can benefit all sides, if only those with influence in Beijing can articulate this role and its cascading benefits.
The international community has a separate duty. It is counterproductive to call for an independent Hong Kong or to further inflame the rhetoric. But we should be supporting — urgently and in our own streets — their right to freedom of assembly, association and expression, and to have an independent judiciary. These rights should never have been left at risk by the handover agreement signed in 1997, when the region was returned to China. Hong Kong was given and received as a colony, with all the disrespect to its residents that this implies. Without these rights, residents, simply by attempting to debate and create an equitable, stable future, will pay a terrible price.
China’s strict censorship and control of the media has allowed mainland news sites to propagate the false narrative that Hong Kong residents are under siege from a foreign-controlled cell of hooligans and fifth elements. It is a dangerous and cynical lie, used time and again by military powers to justify violent intervention.
Chinese language, poetics and philosophy are part of Hong Kong’s soul. The questions confronting it have no easy answers: how will Hong Kong maintain itself, neither jeopardizing the Chinese state nor being jeopardized by it? How can Hong Kong — and the separate political and legal system it was promised by Britain and China — survive in this rapidly changing global order?
This question concerns all of us. Illegitimate power relies exclusively on force. China is a sophisticated and influential state, yet satellite images show it has amassed what appear to be over 100 armored personnel vehicles several miles from Hong Kong, as if force is the only politics it knows.
In the years since the handover, China’s rise had been dramatic. The economic infrastructure connecting Hong Kong and China is profound. In the next few decades, when China’s Greater Bay Area project is expected to be finalized, Hong Kong will be part of a megalopolis that will include Macau, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and seven other Chinese cities, comprising 70 million people and producing 37 percent of China’s exports. The Greater Bay Area does not seem compatible with the “one country, two systems” principle. The future demands ingenuity and, most of all, respect for Hong Kong’s uniquely nuanced identity. Over 150 years of history have shown that economic security and constitutional rights are possible in Hong Kong without posing a threat to the Chinese system.
In 1989, Beijing protesters carried a banner that read, “A new path is opening up, the path we long ago failed to take.” It is a warning to us from the past, a plea not to fail again. For 30 years, China has rigorously censored all mention of the 1989 Tiananmen demonstrations and massacre. The government continues to arrest and detain the elderly parents of those who died. Even now, aged and frail, these mothers and fathers continue to remember their lost children and protest.
Zhao Ziyang remained under house arrest for nearly 16 years without being charged with a crime. In his private journals, he came to believe in the necessity of safeguarding a free press and independent judiciary among other reforms. He advocated not just love of country — China’s culture and influence, its strength and agility — but love for its most extraordinary asset, its people.
When Zhao died in 2005, his death was censored in China; but in Hong Kong, 15,000 people paid tribute to him in a candlelight vigil. Hong Kong faithfully remembered what China could not allow itself to mourn. It still does.

Is a Crackdown Coming in Hong Kong?,"Beijing doesn’t want to intervene. But its own propaganda efforts may force Xi Jinping’s hand.
With the Hong Kong government paralyzed by mass protests, the chances of armed intervention from Beijing, once unthinkable, are rising by the day.
Far from hiding its intent, Beijing has been parading it in full view over the past week. The protesters, initially reviled as mobs, have been rebranded by Chinese officials as criminals and terrorists. The state media has broadcast ominous footage of its anti-riot police, who fall under the command of the People’s Liberation Army, marshaled on the Hong Kong border in Shenzhen.
To be sure, the threats against the protesters are designed to ensure that Beijing never has to carry them through. By displaying their fury and firepower, Chinese leaders are hoping the protesters will retreat.
But Beijing’s long-term management of Hong Kong and the internal logic of its own politics mean that President Xi Jinping and the ruling Communist Party have few offramps to dial down the conflict, even if they might well wish to.
Beijing doesn’t have to be reminded about the disastrous road it is heading down. The fallout from its use of military force in 1989 to clear demonstrators out of central Beijing and other cities has reverberated for decades in elite politics and the military in China, as well as overseas, where the crackdown lives on as a symbol of repressive Communist Party rule.
China has learned a lot since then about how to better manage protests within its own borders. A highly trained paramilitary force, the People’s Armed Police, now takes the lead in dealing with local disturbances. With the P.A.P.’s help, the authorities’ priority is to unwind any demonstrations with minimal violence and disperse protesters before unrest spreads.
Most important, propaganda department directives tightly manage the reporting of protests in the domestic Chinese media, to ensure that grievances aired in one locality don’t spread nationally and gain a momentum of their own.
There is no containing the protests in Hong Kong, however. The former British colony has a vigorous media, in both Chinese and English, scores of international journalists, a boisterous civil society, an unimpeded internet — for the moment at least — and tens of thousands of citizen journalists recording events on their mobile phones.
Hong Kong’s insurrection won’t be quelled with the imprisonment of a few students. One way or another, it will go on and on. As effective as the party’s well-honed protest management techniques are on the mainland, they won’t work in Hong Kong.
The party initially ordered the Chinese media not to cover the protests at all. Over the past week, however, it has discarded that approach and begun to push a narrative for its own citizens, of how anti-China activists in Hong Kong have joined forces with malevolent foreigners like the C.I.A.
State media have also ominously compared the protests to a “color revolution,” the collective term for the protests that took place in the early years of the century and toppled many governments in parts of the former Soviet Union and the Balkans and, a decade later, in the Middle East.
Communist Party officials are forced to study the history of these upheavals and how they were manipulated by foreign governments, especially the United States government, to bring down unfriendly regimes. “Color revolutions,” in other words, are synonymous with regime change in the eyes of the party and must be snuffed out before the disease spreads, in this case, to mainland China itself.
In portraying the protests as a “color revolution” that is trampling on Chinese sovereignty, the party-state may have set the wheels in motion to act in a way that any cool assessment would advise against.
In shifting to a hard-line stance on trade against the United States in recent months, Mr. Xi cleverly anticipated a coming nationalistic backlash in the Politburo against what many had come to see as the Trump administration’s overreach. In China, no leader can afford to vacate the commanding heights of nationalism nor stumble in standing firm against the predations of foreigners.
The same rule applies here, where Beijing, according to its own propaganda, is battling not just Hong Kong’s young hotheads but also the foreigners manipulating them.
Mr. Xi still has the power and the status to set his own course on Hong Kong. But the risk is that the same nationalist dynamic that took root in the trade dispute may now force his hand here as well. The deep disdain that many mainlanders have for Hong Kong, which many regard as a pampered enclave, only reinforces this sentiment.
At some point, the need to punish the protesters for their desecration of Beijing and the affront they represent to the Communist Party will begin to outweigh in internal political calculations the downside of intervention.
It is hard to say where that point lies. The protesters’ takeover of Hong Kong Airport this week seemed for a moment to have bought the crisis to a head. But the secrecy surrounding top-level Chinese politics makes the leaders’ next move hard to predict. China can’t send in the tanks, as it did in 1989. Hong Kong’s hilly topography makes that impossible even if it wanted to. But Beijing could send in anti-riot police to work along their Hong Kong counterparts.
Only Mr. Xi can authorize the offering of an olive branch to the protesters. Even a small concession, however, will be portrayed as giving in.
For someone seen as an all-powerful leader — the “chairman of everything,” as he is called — that might be a bridge too far. Without seduction in his arsenal, Mr. Xi may have to resort to force.

Is Xi Mishandling Hong Kong Crisis? Hints of Unease in China’s Leadership,"BEIJING — China’s leader, Xi Jinping, warned a gathering of senior Communist Party officials in January that the country faced a raft of urgent economic and political risks, and told them to be on guard especially for “indolence, incompetence and becoming divorced from the public.”
Now, after months of political tumult in Hong Kong, the warning seems prescient. Only it is Mr. Xi himself and his government facing criticism that they are mishandling China’s biggest political crisis in years, one that he did not mention in his catalog of looming risks at the start of the year.
And although few in Beijing would dare blame Mr. Xi openly for the government’s handling of the turmoil, there is quiet grumbling that his imperious style and authoritarian concentration of power contributed to the government’s misreading of the scope of discontent in Hong Kong, which is only growing.
On Friday and Saturday the protests and clashes with the police continued in Hong Kong, even after the region’s embattled chief executive, Carrie Lam, made a major concession days earlier by withdrawing a bill that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to the mainland, legislation that first incited the protests three months ago.
The Communist Party’s leadership — and very likely Mr. Xi himself — has been surprised by or oblivious to the depth of the animosity, which has driven hundreds of thousands into the streets of Hong Kong for the past three months. While it was the extradition bill that set off the protests, they are now sustained by broader grievances against the Chinese government and its efforts to impose greater control over the semiautonomous territory.
Beijing has been slow to adapt to events, allowing Mrs. Lam to suspend the bill in June, for example, but refusing at the time to let her withdraw it completely. It was a partial concession that reflected the party’s hard-line instincts under Mr. Xi and fueled even larger protests.
As public anger in Hong Kong has climbed, the Chinese government’s response has grown bombastic and now seems at times erratic.
In July, at a meeting that has not been publicly disclosed, Mr. Xi met with other senior officials to discuss the protests. The range of options discussed is unclear, but the leaders agreed that the central government should not intervene forcefully, at least for now, several people familiar with the issue said in interviews in Hong Kong and Beijing.
At that meeting, the officials concluded that the Hong Kong authorities and the local police could eventually restore order on their own, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
There are hints of divisions in the Chinese leadership and stirrings of discontent about Mr. Xi’s policies.
Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University and an expert on Chinese politics, said it appeared that there was debate during the annual informal leaders’ retreat in Beidaihe, a seaside resort not far from Beijing.
Some party leaders called for concessions, while others urged action to bring Hong Kong more directly under the mainland’s control, he said. Mr. Cabestan said he believed that “the Chinese leadership is divided on Hong Kong and how to solve the crisis.”
Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing, said Mr. Xi’s government had in effect adopted a strategy to procrastinate in the absence of any better ideas for resolving the crisis. “It is not willing to intervene directly or to propose a solution,” he said. “The idea is to wait things out until there is a change.”
The upshot is that instead of defusing or containing the crisis, Mr. Xi’s government has helped to widen the political chasm between the central government and many of the seven million residents in a city that is an important hub of international trade and finance, critics say.
Another sign of the disarray within the government was the reaction to Mrs. Lam’s withdrawal of the bill. On Tuesday, officials in Beijing declared there could be no concessions to the protesters’ demands. A day later, when Mrs. Lam pulled the bill back, she claimed to have Beijing’s blessing to do so. The same officials were silent.
On Friday, China’s premier, Li Keqiang, said during a news conference with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who was visiting China, that the government supported Hong Kong in “halting the violence and disorder in accordance with the law.”
Mr. Xi, who is 66 and in his seventh year of his now unlimited tenure as the country’s paramount leader, has cast himself as an essential commander for a challenging time. He has been lionized in the state news media as no other Chinese leader has been since Mao.
This has made political solutions to the Hong Kong situation harder to find, because even senior officials are reluctant to make the case for compromise or concessions for fear of contradicting or angering Mr. Xi, according to numerous officials and analysts in Hong Kong and Beijing.
“Beijing has overreached, overestimating its capacity to control events and underestimating the complexity of Hong Kong,” said Brian Fong Chi-hang, an associate professor at the Academy of Hong Kong Studies at the Education University of Hong Kong.
The tumult in Hong Kong could pose a risk to Mr. Xi, especially if it exacerbates discontent and discord within the Chinese leadership over other issues.
“I think the danger is not that his standing will collapse, but that there is a whole series of slowly unfolding trends that will gradually corrode his position,” said Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney and author of “Xi Jinping: The Backlash.”
“Hong Kong is one, as the protests look set to carry on despite the concessions,” Mr. McGregor said. “The trade war is adding to the pain,” he added, referring to the current standoff with the United States.
Mr. Xi returned on Tuesday to the same venue as his speech in January — the Communist Party’s Central Party School — and reprised the warnings he raised in January without suggesting they were in fact worsening.
“Faced with the grim conditions and tasks of struggle looming down on us, we must be tough-boned, daring to go on the attack and daring to battle for victory,” he said.
While he warned of “a whole range” of internal and external threats — economic, military and environmental — he mentioned Hong Kong only once, and then only in passing.
“By painting a dark picture of hostile foreign forces or even unrelenting internal challenges the Communist Party faces in retaining power, it helps justify his continuing strong hand,” said Christopher K. Johnson, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
Some analysts see a parallel between Mr. Xi’s handling of Hong Kong and the trade war with the United States, which, like the economy more broadly, seems to be the greatest worry for his government at the moment.
In Hong Kong, Mr. Xi’s government unwaveringly supported the extradition bill. And it stuck by that position, refusing to allow Mrs. Lam to withdraw it formally, even as the protesters’ demands grew broader. Her pledge to withdraw it now has been dismissed as too little, too late.
In the trade talks, China also balked at accepting President Trump’s initial demands for concessions. When the two sides came close to an agreement in the spring, outlined in a 150-page document, Mr. Xi appeared to balk, scuttling the process.
Now Mr. Xi faces an even bigger trade war, with much higher tariffs and greater tensions. The government appears to be hewing to a strategy of waiting out Mr. Trump, possibly through his 2020 re-election campaign, even as the dispute has become a drag on the economy.
It remains unclear how Mr. Xi’s government conveyed its approval for Mrs. Lam’s decision — or whether it did. Mrs. Lam’s sudden shift evolved in a matter of days after last weekend’s clashes between protesters and the police, several officials said.
Mrs. Lam said the decision to withdraw the extradition bill was hers, but she also asserted that she had Beijing’s full support for doing so, suggesting more coordination than either side has publicly acknowledged.
The silence from officials and in the state news media about Mrs. Lam’s concession suggested that if Mr. Xi’s government did approve of the sudden shift, it wanted to stifle public discussion of it in the mainland.
Mrs. Lam herself described the tightrope she must walk during recent remarks to a group of business leaders that were leaked and published by Reuters.
“The political room for the chief executive who, unfortunately, has to serve two masters by constitution, that is, the central people’s government and the people of Hong Kong, that political room for maneuvering is very, very, very limited,” she said.
She also offered a candid assessment of Beijing’s views, even if one she did not intend to make public. She said Beijing had no plan to send in the People’s Liberation Army to restore order because “they’re just quite scared now.”
“Because they know that the price would be too huge to pay,” she went on. “Maybe they don’t care about Hong Kong, but they care about ‘one country, two systems.’ They care about the country’s international profile. It has taken China a long time to build up to that sort of international profile.”
Hong Kong’s unique status, with its own laws and freedoms, has long created a political dilemma for China’s leaders, especially for Mr. Xi, who has made China’s rising economic and political might a central pillar of his public appeals.
China’s recovery of sovereignty over the former British colony is a matter of national pride that reversed a century and a half of colonial humiliation. But the mainland maintains what amounts to an international border with Hong Kong.
The government’s deepest fear now appears to be that the demands for greater political accountability and even universal suffrage heard on the streets in Hong Kong could spread like a contagion through the mainland. So far, there have been few signs of that.
As the crisis has grown, the government has sent thousands of troops from the People’s Armed Police to Shenzhen, the mainland city adjacent to Hong Kong, but the exercise was hastily organized and used an outdated plan drawn up after the protests in 2014, according to one official in Hong Kong.
Beijing also stepped up its propaganda, launching an information — and disinformation — campaign against the protesters and opposition leaders in Hong Kong.
Mr. Xi continues to barely mention Hong Kong. He has said nothing about the protests, even in his passing reference on Tuesday. He has not visited since 2017, when he marked the 20th anniversary of the handover from Britain.
After the traditional August holiday break, Mr. Xi’s public calendar of events has since betrayed no hint of political upheaval or threats to his standing. The media’s portrayal of him, already verging on hagiography, has become even more fawning. State television and the party’s newspapers now refer to him as “the People’s Leader,” an honorific once bestowed only on Mao.
“The People’s Leader loves the people,” The People’s Daily wrote after Mr. Xi toured Gansu, a province in western China.
Mr. Xi’s calculation might be simply to remain patient, as he has been in the case of Mr. Trump’s erratic shifts in the trade war. In his remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Xi also gave a possible hint of the government’s pragmatism.
“On matters of principle, not an inch will be yielded,” he said, “but on matters of tactics there can be flexibility.”

"In Hong Kong’s Crackdown on Protests, Face Mask Ban May Be the Start","HONG KONG — When Hong Kong’s leader invoked emergency powers to ban face masks during protests, she went to great lengths to explain that the city wasn’t in a state of emergency. Rather, she declared, after months of unrest, the city was in a “very critical state of public danger.”
The message, and the ban itself, were highly calculated. They were designed to show that the government was taking action to protect public safety while trying not to provoke more violence from protesters.
The pro-Beijing camp of government leaders and lawmakers, from moderates like Chief Executive Carrie Lam to the hard-liners, was also determined to deal with the unrest, and not give the Chinese leadership any reason to intervene.
“We want to resolve it ourselves,” said Regina Ip, a hard-line member of Mrs. Lam’s cabinet who leads a political party that is popular with police officers.
Trying to restore public order without spurring more protests will be hard to achieve, however, and the city’s leadership is already considering imposing other measures to crack down. Starkly different views on just the face-mask ban underscore how irreconcilable the differences between the government and the protesters have become.
To Hong Kong’s top leaders, the ban, punishable by up to a year in prison, was a measured approach. It avoided for now the more extreme options proposed by some pro-Beijing hard-liners, like far harsher sentences, running courthouses 24 hours a day or imposing a curfew.
To the protesters, the prohibition — targeting standard gear at demonstrations — is a manifestation of their worst fears, an erosion of the civil liberties that have differentiated the semiautonomous territory from the rest of China. In their thinking, simply asserting the emergency powers is a worrisome sign that Beijing will exert ever more influence over the city.
After an eerie quiet pervaded the city on Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters returned on Sunday to march in the rain, defying the ban by wearing masks. While the marches started peacefully, protesters on the edges set up barricades, lit fires and vandalized shops whose owners they perceived to be supporters of Beijing.
The police fired many rounds of tear gas in an effort to disperse the crowds, and urged residents to stay home.
“The most disastrous thing is that you invoke an archaic, draconian, colonial piece of legislation made at a time, 1922, when Hong Kong did not have a mini-constitution,” said Alan Leong, chairman of the pro-democracy Civic Party. “It is no longer rule of law; it is now rule by one woman.”
For nearly two months, Mrs. Lam and her top advisers vigorously debated how to tamp down the increasing violence. They consulted extensively with civil liberties and human rights lawyers within the government, as well as constitutional experts and security specialists.
The discussions continued this past week in the hallways and restaurants of the opulent Grand Hyatt hotel in Beijing, where Mrs. Lam’s 240-member delegation stayed before attending China’s National Day parade on Tuesday. Mrs. Lam, at a news conference on Friday announcing the ban, made a point of emphasizing that she did not discuss the issue during that visit with any Beijing officials.
To avoid potential protesters at Hong Kong’s airport, Mrs. Lam caught a flight on Tuesday afternoon to Shenzhen on the mainland border, then crossed over into the city. Just as Mrs. Lam was arriving home, a police officer shot a protester in the chest at point-blank range.
The bullet barely missed the protester’s heart, spine and major arteries. “On the first of October, we were three centimeters away from disaster,” said Ronny Tong, another member of Mrs. Lam’s cabinet, the Executive Council.
With the shooting, Mrs. Lam and her team believed that they had no choice but to invoke the colonial-era Emergency Regulations Ordinance. The law, which hadn’t been used since deadly riots in the late 1960s, gives the chief executive extraordinary power to enact rules without going through the legislature.
Other options, beyond the mask ban, are still under consideration if the chaos intensifies, according to advisers to Mrs. Lam, several of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the issue. But the policy options all have their own limitations and the potential to further incite protesters.
A curfew is on the list, possibly targeted just at teenagers, whom the authorities have blamed for much of the recent violence. The British used a curfew in Hong Kong to restore order during rioting by pro-Communist activists in 1967.
But imposing one now isn’t entirely practical. Protesters have shown a talent for moving quickly around the city, so the authorities would need a curfew for all neighborhoods. And the police, already stretched, don’t necessarily have the resources to enforce it.
A second option, according to Mrs. Lam’s advisers, is to give the police more time to hold suspects before they must be charged by prosecutors with a criminal offense or released. Currently, they have only 48 hours, which the Hong Kong police say isn’t enough time to investigate.
The British in 1967 took a far more drastic measure by suspending such limits. Back then, the authorities detained dozens of Maoist activists for half a year without charges at a special prison.
Human rights lawyers inside and outside the government have warned that any move toward longer detentions now may be struck down by Hong Kong’s courts. More legal protections are available to residents under the Basic Law, the mini-constitution issued in 1997, when Hong Kong was returned to the Chinese.
But the most likely policy option now being considered, several of Mrs. Lam’s advisers said, is to greatly extend the operating hours at Hong Kong courthouses so that they can put numerous violent protesters behind bars quickly.
To that end, the Hong Kong leadership is closely studying the British government’s response to lethal riots in 2011 in London’s Tottenham neighborhood and elsewhere around the country, said Albert H. Y. Chen, a prominent law professor at Hong Kong University who advises Beijing on legal issues in the territory. During the unrest, Britain temporarily operated courts for 24 hours a day to quickly process a large number of people detained on accusations of arson, assaulting police officers and other offenses.
It could be relatively easy to operate Hong Kong courts around the clock, since the city still has almost identical judicial rules to Britain, a legacy of more than 150 years of colonial rule. The main obstacle is Hong Kong’s shortage of judges.
Attracting the city’s top legal minds to become judges has been hard because they can earn more in the private sector, while the process for appointing new judges is long and contentious. Mrs. Lam could bypass the process with her emergency powers and name a lot of young, pro-Beijing judges, but that would undermine Hong Kong’s international reputation for judicial independence.
So far, the government is unwilling to go to the extreme of calling for intervention by Beijing.
An obscure provision under the Basic Law, Article 18, allows the mainland to extend its stringent national security laws to Hong Kong if the Standing Committee of China’s rubber-stamp legislature “decides that the region is in a state of emergency.” Mrs. Lam seemed to fend off this possibility when she emphasized on Friday that Hong Kong wasn’t in such a dire position.
Still, Lau Siu-kai, a former top city official who is a leading adviser to Beijing on Hong Kong policy, said that unrest had reached the point where Article 18 might become an option at some point.
Mr. Lau cautioned, however, that he wasn’t calling for it. Beijing, he said, did not want to intervene and become responsible for fixing Hong Kong’s problems.
“That is the last thing Beijing wants to do,” Mr. Lau said. “Right now, Beijing is ready for a long, drawn-out war, because what is happening in Hong Kong is hurting Hong Kong more than the mainland.”

"In Hong Kong, Unity Between Peaceful and Radical Protesters. For Now.","Five years ago, protesters were critical of even breaking windows. Now, some are throwing firebombs.
One slogan in the Hong Kong protests has taken on new significance: “Don’t distance yourself; don’t snitch.”
The slogan is a call for the protesters to remain united, even as different factions emerge and their tactics diverge.
During the more than 100 days of the anti-government protests, the various camps — from the most peaceful to the most confrontational — have generally avoided publicly criticizing each others’ actions. The approach has persisted despite the steady flare-ups of violence including this past weekend, when protesters threw bricks and gasoline bombs.
Carrie Lam, the Hong Kong chief executive, complained about the solidarity when she announced this month that she would withdraw the extradition legislation, which originally incited the movement.
She called on peaceful protesters to distance themselves from “the really violent protesters who have been attacking our public infrastructure, blocking the roads, storming into buildings and disrupting the normal operations of the airport and the rail,” she said.
While the unity is continuously tested, many protesters consider it important for their success. The Umbrella Movement, the 79 days of sit-ins that began five years ago on Saturday, ended when some groups of protesters denounced others’ more aggressive actions and legal injunctions whittled away the protest sites.
Here is a look at the various camps, their roots, and how they’re coexisting.
The city’s protest tradition
Hong Kong has had a long tradition of peaceful marches attended by hundreds of thousands of people. It dates back at least to 1989, when Hong Kongers turned out en masse to support the Tiananmen protests in Beijing and to mourn those killed in the crackdown. On May 21, 1989, organizers said one million people marched in the city.
Vigils held on the anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown have continued ever since. Szeto Wah, a pro-democracy lawmaker and union leader, who helped organize the events, insisted they be peaceful, rational and nonviolent, or woh-leih-fei in the Cantonese shorthand.
“This phrase is so popular because Hong Kong people have been quite allergic to any sort of violence or any physical clashes,” said Bonnie Leung of the Civil Human Rights Front, an umbrella group that organized the large, peaceful marches during the current protests. “For a very long time, pan-democratic people and the general public think of woh-leih-fei as the general principle of how we protest in Hong Kong.”
When half a million people marched on July 1, 2003, to protest against proposed national security laws, the government quickly backed down, a big victory for the strategy of woh-leih-fei.
The rise of the militants
But the government has been unmoved by peaceful protests in recent years. And a growing number of activists have criticized the approach as too conciliatory.
“Woh-leih-fei, the gist of it is to give pressure to the government sheerly through the number of protesters,” said Samson Yuen, an assistant professor of political science at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. “But since 2010 the government has been increasingly unresponsive to the turnouts, even if there are high numbers.”
The past decade has seen the rise of a new group of more confrontational protesters known as the yuhng mouh, or “the valiant” in Cantonese. Unlike the peaceful group, they are willing to clash with the police, though they argue the authorities use more force.
Sometimes they damage private property. But they tend to focus their aggression on symbols of the state, such as government buildings, police vehicles and recently the subway system, which has begun to close stations in neighborhoods where protests are taking place.
The targeted nature of such destruction means it generally escapes widespread condemnation from the peaceful camp, but that could change if the damage were to become more haphazard.
“We had to upgrade our protests,” said Peter Mok, a 26-year-old clerk, who was wearing a face mask and a rain jacket as he joined demonstrators repelled from the government headquarters by tear gas on August 31. “Peaceful protests weren’t working. The government said they don’t care.”
‘If we burn, you burn with us”
The ongoing protests have also seen the popularization of a scorched earth philosophy. It is sometimes identified by the phrase “laahm chau” in Cantonese, a combination of words meaning “to embrace” and “to fry.”
Its adherents argue that Hong Kong has created a deeply unfair system, and needs a complete overhaul.
“It exists in different degrees because people don’t see themselves as benefiting, not just economically but also having a stake in the system,” said Mr. Yuen.
A quotation from the “Hunger Games” series of books has been widely used to explain the idea: “If we burn, you burn with us.”
The slogan has been expressly singled out by central government officials, who criticize it as a suicide pact to bring down Hong Kong’s economy.
An anonymous Telegram account, “I want laahm chau,” published a widely circulated essay challenging the argument that the idea offered an apocalyptic vision for Hong Kong. It argued that the protesters’ creativity showed the city’s prospects if it was not dominated by powerful special interest groups.
“The end point of laahm chau is not a tragedy, rather it is filled with hope,” it said.
The account helped organize a protest in August that called for the United States Congress to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, legislation that would impose sanctions against officials who undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy. The protesters also called on Britain, the former colonial ruler of Hong Kong, to declare that China had violated the terms of the territory’s handover.
Legacy of the Umbrella Movement
During the final weeks of 2014’s Umbrella Movement, dozens of protesters charged out of their camp near the government’s headquarters, grabbed metal barricades and began smashing the reinforced glass walls of the legislature.
The police soon arrived and arrested at least six people. Student groups and pro-democracy lawmakers condemned the destruction.
This year, however, is different. When dozens of protesters grabbed metal bars on July 1 and again began smashing the entry to the legislature, the voices of restraint were quickly drowned out.
The protesters kept smashing, and eventually broke through. Dozens charged inside, damaging symbols of China’s central government, smashing photos of pro-Beijing politicians and marring the walls with graffiti.
“It was you who taught us that peaceful protest don’t work,” read one message.
There was no barrage of criticism from the standard-bearers of nonviolence. And they have largely held back even as violence has escalated and clashes with police officers and civilians have become continued.
“The yuhng mouh and the peaceful, they fought with each other,” Mr. Mok said of the Umbrella Movement. “Each thought they were right. But now we think both sides are important and we have to help each other.”
The symbiotic relationship
Each camps’ importance became apparent early on in the movement. The government pushed ahead with the contentious legislation even after the June 9 march, which organizers said had drawn more than one million people.
On June 12, protesters took a more assertive approach. They surrounded the legislature, clashing with the police and blocking pro-establishment lawmakers from entering the building.
“Without them risking their lives, the bill would have been passed,” said Bonnie Leung of the Civil Human Rights Front. “This was a significant moment, a point for us to understand each other. The radical approach can be useful.”
At the same time, peaceful protests have continued to show the breadth of opposition to the government, she added. On June 16, nearly two million people marched, according to organizers’ estimates.
“This number is the spine of the whole movement and attracts the attention of the whole world,” she said.
Brian Leung, the only protester to take off his mask and reveal his identity during the July 1 break-in of the legislature, said the escalation that night was the result of sustained support between the two sides.
“The key to that is the mutual trust and the recognition that the other part is also striving for what they’re striving, that there is a common goal,” he said. “Of course it has to be bounded by some kind of moral concern, that your escalation has to be justified.”
Testing the Unity
At times, violent measures have tested the solidarity between protesters. Last month, after days of protest at the airport, demonstrators assaulted two men from mainland China. But protesters’ decision to apologize helped convince people in the nonviolent camp to remain aligned, said Ms. Leung.
“Because of their willingness to reflect and improve and willingness to apologize, I was convinced that in our movement, the radical protesters and the peaceful protesters, we are still heading in the right direction,” she said.
That solidarity likely worries the central government more than the actual violence itself, said Mr. Yuen.
“They’re not worried about individuals throwing rocks, because that’s very easy to handle,” he said. “But they are worried when everybody retreats at the same time. Or everybody appears at a place at the same time. If I am the ruler, I would be scared, because I cannot divide the group.”

Hong Kong’s Leader Bends to Protests. But It May Not Break the Movement.,"The demonstrators want a say in how they’re governed and the withdrawal of an extradition bill may not satisfy them.
Hong Kong’s hot summer of street protests has entered its 13th week, the demonstrations’ intensity only increasing with hundreds of arrests, clouds of tear gas and volleys of rubber bullets. With every passing week, what began as a popular protest against a proposed extradition law has hardened into a struggle for the soul of Hong Kong, dimming the potential for a negotiated resolution.
Hong Kong authorities had hoped that the start of the school year would take some of the energy out of the protests, but memories of the Umbrella Movement of 2014, which petered out after 79 days without any political concessions from the government, have apparently helped keep the protesters in the streets. On Wednesday, Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s embattled chief executive, said she was withdrawing the extradition bill, but it was not clear if this would appease the demonstrators, who have several grievances with the government.
Ms. Lam confided in private that she’d quit if she could, but that her superiors in Beijing won’t let her go, most likely for fear of being seen to cave to the protesters’ demands. And even if she could negotiate with protesters, their movement is leaderless, making it unclear whom she’d talk to. Even less likely is the possibility that China will entertain one of their central demands, universal suffrage, which to the Communist rulers is tantamount to being asked to surrender Hong Kong to the West.
China massed troops along Hong Kong’s border and issued angry broadsides, insinuating a devious American plot behind the “terrorism” of the protesters, but clearly preferred to leave the dirty work to Hong Kong authorities and the local police. The big question hanging over the city, a semiautonomous enclave, is how much protest Beijing will stomach before taking direct action, or backing down.
Inevitably, that raises the memory of Tiananmen. But that was 30 years ago, before China grew into an economic powerhouse with global reach, capable of sustaining a trade war with the United States and of dismissing criticism from Britain, Hong Kong’s former colonial master, with a disdainful shrug: “We urge Britain to know its place.” Many China watchers believe that the new China has worked too hard shaping its image as a tough but responsible power to lose it by bringing Hong Kong forcefully to heel.
Of course, China’s hard-line leader, Xi Jinping, must be seething. One of the central government’s most ardently held tenets is “One China,” which stipulates that territories ceded in weaker times remain sovereign Chinese lands that will eventually revert to full Chinese control. Hong Kong was first; the far greater prize is Taiwan. Whatever hopes Beijing may harbor of bringing Taiwan, a democracy, into its fold would become even more remote if Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” formula disintegrated in a Tiananmen-style crackdown.
Focused ideologically on “One China,” mainland China seems incapable of understanding what the Hong Kong protesters really want. Though as a police state China no doubt has reams of information from officials, spies and informers, the rulers probably hear what they want to hear, that most Hong Kongers are content with their relative prosperity and freedom and will eventually reject rabble-rousers. So the protests must be the work of outside agitators seeking a “color revolution” like those that swept through Ukraine and Georgia.
But the Hong Kong protesters are not waging a color revolution. Their goal is not some abstract ideal of democracy, but the memory of a way of life they have no intention of letting Beijing take away. They are fired not by foreign agents but by China’s attempts to deny them full participation in their government, which they were promised through 2047 in the agreement under which Britain ceded control over Hong Kong.
That’s a just cause, even if the protesters have at times resorted to violence. In the past, the United States would be expected to intercede as the world’s greatest champion of human rights. Alas, President Trump has so far treated the Hong Kong protests largely as a diversion from his trade war with China, at one point telling Mr. Xi that the United States would not interfere in what China did in Hong Kong. Mr. Trump has since issued a variety of conflicting tweets and remarks, of which the most supportive of the pro-democracy demonstrators was a demand that Mr. Xi “work humanely with Hong Kong.”
The better response, from Mr. Trump and all others who care for democracy, is to stand with the people of Hong Kong who want nothing more than a say in how they are governed.

China Pressures Business Over Hong Kong. Workers Get Caught in the Middle.,"Beijing wants global companies to back its power over the city, even as their workers join protests calling for greater say in the fate of their home.
As Hong Kong seethes with protests against China’s rule, Beijing is increasingly pressuring the business world to take its side. Businesses, both global and local, are falling in line — and their employees are caught in the crossfire.
The most dramatic example came on Friday, when Rupert Hogg, the chief executive of Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways, resigned in the face of Chinese pressure after some of the airline’s workers participated in the demonstrations.
Now, global accounting firms are coming under the same pressure.
The Big Four firms — PwC, Deloitte, KPMG and Ernst & Young, now known as EY — put out statements distancing themselves from a full-page ad supporting the demonstrations that appeared in Hong Kong’s Apple Daily newspaper on Friday. The ad was signed and paid for by a group of anonymous employees of the firms.
“We will never fear or compromise with injustice and unfairness,” the text of the ad read. In response, PwC declared that the ad “does not represent the firm’s position,” adding, “We firmly oppose any action and statement that challenge national sovereignty.”
It is not clear whether the companies’ statements will be enough. The Global Times, a tabloid controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, has urged the firms to “fire employees found to have the wrong stance on the Hong Kong situation.” Mainland Chinese internet users have warned them against “becoming the next Cathay Pacific.”
David Webb, the publisher of the financial and corporate governance website Webb-site in Hong Kong, said Mr. Hogg’s resignation was “shocking and shameful,” adding that “it’s an illustration of the influence that can be brought to bear by the mainland government on Hong Kong businesses.”
“I think it would have all the C.E.O.s of the major companies looking over their shoulder and wondering whether they will be next to be held accountable for the actions of their employees,” he said.
[Hundreds of thousands of protesters seeking  a greater say in Hong Kong’s government  took to the city’s streets on Sunday.]
For Hong Kong’s workers and businesses, that means growing tensions in the workplace, a perhaps familiar feeling in places like Google and Amazon where workers have used social media and other platforms to take a more activist stance.
Joseph Lai, a 46-year-old employee of a Chinese manufacturer who marched in Hong Kong’s mass demonstration on Sunday, said he no longer tries to make his mainland colleagues understand why people in Hong Kong are unhappy. But he said he was not worried about what might happen if his bosses found out that he was taking to the streets.
“In that case, I’ll look for another job,” he said. “If we don’t come, how can we say we’re Hong Kong people?”
China’s biggest threat is also its greatest promise: a vast market of 1.4 billion people and an economy that, while slowing, is still growing at a pace that most countries would envy. For global companies like Cathay, lack of access could be devastating.
Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities forbade Cathay employees who participated in protests from doing any work involving flights to mainland China and demanded to see lists of workers who fly in or over its territory. The mainland accounts for nearly a quarter of Cathay’s destinations. Still more of its flights go over Chinese airspace, which would mean expensive rerouting if it did not comply.
Its main shareholder, Swire Pacific, is one of Asia’s largest conglomerates, with extensive interests in China including property, beverages and trading. Air China, a state-run airline, also holds a significant Cathay stake.
On Monday in Hong Kong, Cathay’s shares rose initially then fell more than 1 percent by midmorning.
China wields tremendous economic power over Hong Kong. It accounts for half of the territory’s trade, according to government statistics, as Chinese exporters take advantage of its traditionally low barriers to other countries. China provides about a quarter of all foreign investment in Hong Kong directly, and probably much more when money that flows through tax havens like the British Virgin Islands is counted. The mainland supplies more than a quarter of Hong Kong’s electricity and most of its drinking water. More than three quarters of its tourists come from the mainland.
On the other hand, Hong Kong’s importance to China has dwindled, but Beijing still needs it as a financial hub. Most foreign investment into China flows through the territory. Mainland Chinese companies also raise money through Hong Kong, where global investors have put $2.6 trillion in Chinese company stocks.
Beijing has warned that the protests threaten Hong Kong’s future prosperity. On Sunday, it said it approved a plan to further open up the economy of Shenzhen, a booming city just across the border from Hong Kong, suggesting that it wants to increase competition between the two cities.
For years, businesses in Hong Kong have been able to prosper by staying out of politics. But under China’s current leader, Xi Jinping, the Communist Party has amassed more power and intruded into more parts of Chinese life, including business. It has also taken an increased interest in Hong Kong affairs since protests in 2014, known as Occupy Central, that also challenged China’s policies toward the territory.
Mainland Chinese consumers and businesses, often egged on by state media that criticizes any foreign business that does not appear to show the country proper respect, have also emerged as forces in their own right. The result has been a near-daily campaign to prod companies like Versace, Coach and Givenchy to apologize to China for implying in their products and websites that Hong Kong was a separate country.
On Weibo, the Chinese social media platform, mainland Chinese internet users started a #BoycottCathayPacific hashtag, which was viewed half a million times. Analysts at the state-owned Industrial and Commercial Bank of China put a “strong sell” rating on the stock because of what it called “poor crisis management.”
On the other hand, companies risk going too far in placating China. When the actress Liu Yifei last week publicly supported the Hong Kong police, protesters called for a boycott of “Mulan,” the live-action Disney film set to be released next year in which she will play the title character.
While Cathay has been the most visible example of pressure on Hong Kong business, it was by no means the first.
In early July, the maker of Pocari Sweat, a Japanese sports drink popular in Hong Kong, pulled its advertising from TVB, Hong Kong’s dominant broadcaster, which has been accused by protesters of having a pro-Beijing bias. But it said in two subsequent statements that it upheld the “one country, two systems” principle.
Last week, the property tycoon Peter Woo, the former chairman of the real estate company Wheelock and its subsidiary Wharf Holdings, criticized protests that had turned violent. His comments came after Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of the Global Times, attacked one of Mr. Woo’s shopping malls for “kowtowing” to the protesters by allowing them to remove the Chinese flag from a flagpole and throw it into the sea. Mr. Hu also criticized the mall for barring the police to avoid the sort of clashes that have taken place at other shopping centers.
The pressure on the Big Four accounting firms illustrates how global companies can become targets, too.
The employees’ ad that ran in the Apple Daily newspaper on Friday resulted from a crowdfunding effort that raised $9,873 from 264 people, according to the crowdfunding website GoGetFunding. It inflamed many mainland Chinese nationalists online who were already angry at PwC for what they saw as an initial weak response to the protests. An article on Aug. 5 in the Global Times quoted the company as saying it respects the “people’s right to freedom of speech.” The newspaper called it “fence sitting.”
This was not the first time that the employees of the Big Four accounting firms have broken ranks with their bosses. In 2014, during the Occupy Central protests, the companies published an ad saying the protests would harm Hong Kong’s status as a financial center. The employees responded with another ad in the Apple Daily that said, “Hey boss, your statement doesn’t represent us.”
For any company, restraining employees from speaking out can be tough. But in Hong Kong, it could become a necessity.
“For any of these organizations, it is necessary for them, within the framework of the law, to constrain or to require their employees not to touch the bottom line of the law,” said Wang Jun, chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank, a commercial bank based in central China. “I think that is very important.”

Hong Kong Protests Put N.B.A. on Edge in China,"A tweet from the Houston Rockets general manager prompted a backlash in China, making things uncomfortable for a league used to its players and representatives speaking out on politics.
HONG KONG — The N.B.A. superstar LeBron James has routinely insulted President Trump. Two of the league’s most successful coaches, Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich, have repeatedly slammed American lawmakers for inaction on gun legislation. And other basketball stars regularly speak out on social and political issues — police shootings, elections and racism — without fear of retribution from the league.
But this weekend, a Houston Rockets executive unwittingly exposed an issue that may have been too much for the National Basketball Association: support for protesters in Hong Kong, which infuriated China.
“Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong,” read an image posted on Twitter by Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Rockets. It was quickly deleted.
But the damage was done, and the N.B.A. quickly moved to smooth things over in a lucrative market that generates millions of dollars in revenue. The league said it was “regrettable” that many Chinese fans were offended by the comment.
On Tuesday, CCTV, China’s state broadcaster, said it would suspend broadcasts of the league’s preseason games played in China. Some initial Chinese reports of the broadcaster’s statement, which left room for uncertainty, indicated that the ban covered all preseason games.
Sponsors in China paused their deals with the Rockets, and the country’s main broadcaster said it would remove the team’s games from its schedule. Two exhibition games scheduled for a low-level team affiliated with the Rockets were also canceled.
The issue is familiar to Hollywood studios, major companies and individual athletes chasing business in a country with 1.4 billion people, and the N.B.A.’s reaction reflects a corporate sensitivity toward China’s low tolerance for criticism of its political system.
The league’s statement, in turn, inflamed supporters of the Hong Kong protests and many fans in the United States, where the protesters are generally seen as battling a repressive government. Democratic and Republican politicians found agreement in calling the league gutless, accusing it of prioritizing money over human rights.
Morey’s original tweet, which he later apologized for in a two-part post, was defended by Senator Ted Cruz, who disagreed with the league’s decision to back away from the comments.
Speaking ahead of a scheduled preseason game between the Rockets and Toronto Raptors in Japan, the N.B.A.’s commissioner, Adam Silver, acknowledged the fallout but said the league supported Morey’s right to free expression.
“There is no doubt, the economic impact is already clear,” Silver told Kyodo News. “There have already been fairly dramatic consequences from that tweet, and I have read some of the media suggesting that we are not supporting Daryl Morey, but in fact we have.”
On Tuesday, Silver tried again to limit the impact, saying that the league’s initial statement had left people “angered, confused or unclear on who we are or what the N.B.A. stands for.”
“It is inevitable that people around the world — including from America and China — will have different viewpoints over different issues,” he said in a new statement. “It is not the role of the N.B.A. to adjudicate those differences.”
He continued: “However, the N.B.A. will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way.”
James and the Los Angeles Lakers play two games in China this week against the Brooklyn Nets, a team owned by Joseph Tsai, the billionaire co-founder of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.
Tsai said in a statement late Sunday that Hong Kong was a “third-rail issue” in China, calling the efforts by protesters a “separatist movement.” (Most protesters deny they are interested in independence, but the Chinese state media has at times depicted them that way.)
Tilman Fertitta, the owner of the Rockets and Morey’s boss, publicly rebuked Morey but said later that the general manager’s job was not in danger.
The N.B.A. is far from the first company to find itself forced to choose sides on geopolitical issues it never intended to be involved in, and to ultimately bow to China’s economic might.
China is an attractive — and necessary — lure for nearly all global institutions, with an economy that while slowing, continues to grow at a pace that is the envy of many countries. Any threat to an ability to do business in China would have dire financial consequences for many multinational corporations.
As a result, many companies have apologized or made concessions after angering China. In many cases, the companies found themselves scrambling to respond to comments or Twitter posts made by executives or other employees that generate unwanted attention on social networks.
“Obviously corporations and others perceive that their business interests are at risk, so they are apologizing,” said Shanthi Kalathil, the senior director of the International Forum for Democratic Studies at the National Endowment for Democracy. “But where I would perceive the risks is at the level of reputation. These are well-respected global brands and there is reputational cost to simply going along with the party line.”
In an effort to avoid losing access to Chinese airspace, Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong’s flagship airline, fired employees who wrote posts on social media in support of the protests. In August, Rupert Hogg, the airline’s chief executive, resigned.
Nike, which endorses James, pulled some shoes after a fashion designer’s support for the Hong Kong protests sparked a social media backlash against the brand.
The stakes are particularly high for the N.B.A. in China.
Tencent Holdings, a Chinese tech conglomerate, reported that 490 million people watched N.B.A. programming on its platforms last year, including 21 million fans who watched Game 6 of the 2019 N.B.A. finals. By comparison, Nielsen measured 18.3 million viewers for the game on the American network ABC.
The league recently announced a five-year extension of its partnership with Tencent to stream its games in China for a reported $1.5 billion.
“This is a massive indicator for the perceived value and enormous potential of the China market,” Mailman, a sports digital marketing agency, wrote in a recent report.
The N.B.A. has been similarly successful on Chinese social media. The league has 41.8 million followers on Weibo, a popular Chinese social network, compared with 38.6 million followers on Facebook and 28.4 million on Twitter.
The involvement of the Rockets is particularly troublesome for the N.B.A., given the franchise’s longtime status as among the most popular team in China. Yao Ming, considered the crown jewel of Chinese basketball, played for the Rockets from 2002 to 2011.
Yao is now the president of the Chinese Basketball Association, which suspended its relationship with the Rockets. It also canceled two NBA G League games scheduled for this month between affiliates of the Rockets and the Dallas Mavericks, said a person with knowledge of the decision who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.
Houston was the second-most-popular team in China behind the Golden State Warriors last year, according to Mailman. The team had 7.3 million followers on Weibo, compared with 2.9 million followers on Twitter.
James Harden, a Rockets guard and one of the N.B.A.’s biggest stars, directly apologized to Chinese fans on Monday.
“We apologize. We love China, we love playing there,” he told reporters in Tokyo, where the Rockets were preparing for their preseason game.
“We go there once or twice a year. They show us the most support and love. We appreciate them as a fan base, and we love everything they’re about, and we appreciate the support that they give us,” said Harden, who three years ago spoke out about the shootings of two black men by police.
Echoing China’s worldview, especially as it relates to its sovereignty over disputed territories, is considered a cost of doing business there, for both entertainers and companies.
Gap was forced to apologize in 2017 after selling a shirt that featured a map of China that did not include Taiwan, a self-governing island off its southern coast. The Marriott International hotel chain apologized in January 2018 for listing Tibet, a region of western China, and Taiwan as countries in a customer survey.
In February 2018, the German automaker Daimler apologized for using a quotation from the Dalai Lama, who is widely viewed as a Tibetan separatist in China, in a social media post from its Mercedes-Benz brand.
In March 2018, China demanded that international airlines refer to Taiwan as part of China in their online booking systems, a request mocked by the White House as “Orwellian nonsense” but eventually obeyed by all major carriers.
Movie studios frequently find themselves at odds with state censors in a country where notions of free expression do not apply but billions of dollars ride on international success.
Disney, which has been more successful at navigating these waters than any other American entertainment company, is now in the position of promoting the live-action adaptation of “Mulan” after Crystal Yifei Liu, its Chinese-American star, prompted dueling backlash in the United States and China by supporting a crackdown on protesters by Hong Kong police.
Disney, which had no comment, has inched forward in its positioning in China for decades, leading to the opening of Shanghai Disneyland in 2016 and spectacular results for films like the recent “Avengers: Endgame,” which took in $858 million in the United States and $614 million in China earlier this year. Last year, Chinese moviegoers bought an estimated $8.87 billion in movie tickets, up 9 percent from a year earlier, according to box office analysts.
For its part, the N.B.A. has weathered outrage in China before. Last year, J.J. Redick, then of the Philadelphia 76ers, recorded a video for the Chinese New Year in which he appeared to use a racial slur for Chinese people, which he later said was an unintentional verbal slip. He apologized, but was roundly booed when he touched the ball during preseason games in Shanghai and Shenzhen.

Why Many in China Oppose Hong Kong’s Protests,"Cecilia Zhang is the sort of Chinese person who you might think would be sympathetic to the protesters in Hong Kong. She went to a prestigious American university, gets her news from foreign media and has no plan to move back to the mainland from Hong Kong, where she has worked in the financial industry for the past four years.
But she says she doesn’t understand why people in Hong Kong continue to take to the streets. In fact, she thinks they should go home.
“Hong Kong’s economy is going to be ugly this year after all the strikes,” she said. “Why would you do something that’s not going to benefit you? What can you get out of it?”
It isn’t a surprise that many people in China oppose the protests against a proposed law that would allow Hong Kong to extradite criminal suspects to mainland China. They see only the news that Beijing’s censors let them see.
What is surprising is that many Chinese people who know the full story share that opinion.
Independent polling isn’t allowed in China, so judging public attitudes toward Hong Kong is largely guesswork. But among the educated Chinese I know, the ones who travel and can see the global internet, a large number believe the protesters are wasting their time. They should instead be working to rebuild Hong Kong, they say, a city they see as a one-time beacon of prosperity that is losing its promise.
Their views suggest a hard Chinese line against Hong Kong that goes beyond propaganda. It shows a fundamental shift in how many people in China see the city — and, by extension, how they see their own country. And it reflects a deeply rooted belief in the success of what many call the China Model: economic growth at the cost of individual rights.
The Communist Party has long pushed the Chinese people to look at the world through the lens of economic interests, and skeptical attitudes toward the Hong Kong protests show it has taken firm root. Freedom can’t fill stomachs, this thinking goes. And individual rights of the kind that people in Hong Kong enjoy — to challenge the government in the press, in the courts and on the streets — would lead to chaos in China, bringing back poverty and hunger.
That attitude even among the elite suggests more conflict ahead between Hong Kong and the mainland. It also casts further doubt on the possibility that as China becomes more middle class, its people will inevitably demand more individual rights, forcing the Communist Party to ease its control over society or even democratize.
“Over the past 40 years we’ve only talked about business in the mainland, nothing else,” Zhao Jianfei, a tech executive in Beijing, wrote on his WeChat timeline recently. “All of our thinking is based on the assumption that people are economic animals.”
“Looking at the future, this assumption isn’t going to work,” Mr. Zhao wrote. “We need to wake up.”
That hard focus on economics is by no means unanimous among business types and academics. My colleagues wrote about how some mainlanders living in Hong Kong took part in the protests. At a recent dinner I attended, a group of eight businesspeople largely from the mainland began to belt out in Cantonese “Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies,” Hong Kong’s unofficial freedom anthem by the rock band Beyond.
“Forgive me for embracing freedom with abandonment in my life,” they sang, then cheered for Hong Kong.

But it isn’t hard to find critics of the Hong Kong protests among Western-educated Chinese people. Some worry that the demonstrations will result in violent suppression, as the Chinese government did in 1989 in Tiananmen Square. Others simply think the protesters are worried about the wrong thing.
Tian Feilong, an associate law professor in Beijing who has translated several books on constitutional law and federalism to Chinese from English, asserted in a recent article that the protests were supported by foreign forces, would cause chaos in Hong Kong and ultimately hurt China. It won support online, including the comment from one reader that “it wouldn’t take long for Hong Kong to shrink to a fishing village.” Mr. Tian didn’t respond to a request for comment.
In another popular article headlined “Can Hong Kong be Saved?” the author, Zhao Haoyang, who graduated from a master’s program in the city a few years ago, declared that Hong Kong’s youth aren’t bad people — they’re merely stupid. Hong Kong people have a type of post-prosperity arrogance, he wrote, and the city’s exposure to Western values helps delude the public. The article got over 100,000 page views on the social media platform WeChat, and about 7,000 people made cash donations to the author. The article was later deleted for violating unspecified WeChat content rules, and the author didn’t respond to a request for comment.
These attitudes are a big reversal from how many in China once saw the former British colony. For many Chinese in the 1980s and ’90s, Hong Kong symbolized what we wanted China to be. We imitated fashions in Hong Kong soap operas, learned rudimentary Cantonese so we could sing Cantopop, and were surprised that the police in television shows had to work hard to prove that anybody, even a gangster, was guilty.
“Hong Kong, Hong Kong, why is it so fragrant?” goes the lyric of a popular song in China in the early 1990s, referring to Hong Kong’s Chinese name, which translates to “Fragrant Harbor.” It cited the impending 1997 handover of the city by its British rulers back to Chinese control with the lyrics, “1997, please come soonest. I can go to Hong Kong.”
Many Chinese, including me, stayed up until the early hours of July 1, 1997, to watch the ceremonial handover back to China. We were filled with pride that the shining pearl in the Orient — the name of a popular patriotic song — had returned to the motherland. We were imbued with hope that the rest of China could be as prosperous as Hong Kong.
That was before China became the world’s second-largest economy and a budding superpower. Now, there has been a shift in the way people view the rest of the world. Just as many Chinese people are underwhelmed by the outdated New York City subway systems and by potholes on the highways in Silicon Valley, they are increasingly losing interest in the Hong Kong model of free borders and freedom of speech. Many have come to believe that Hong Kong wouldn’t be so rich without mainland China.
Now the world goes directly to Beijing. Hong Kong’s skyscrapers are overshadowed by those in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Many Hong Kong entertainers learned to speak Mandarin, the primary mainland Chinese dialect. Hong Kong retailers increasingly rely on mainland tourists who splurge on luxury goods.
Hong Kong’s people don’t look as rich as they once did. Mainlanders now see that the majority of Hong Kong residents don’t live in sea view villas, drive luxury cars or dine in fine restaurants as they saw in soap operas. They live in cramped apartments, often much smaller than theirs in Beijing and Shanghai, and work long hours to make a living in one of the most expensive cities in the world.
Mainland visitors are also mistreated at times. Fairly or not, many in Hong Kong blame people from China for spiraling housing costs, as China’s rich park their money in expensive apartments. They see mainlanders as rude and uncultured, and stereotype them as unable to form a line properly or allowing their children to urinate on the streets. That has led to confrontations and resentment on both sides.
Now Hong Kong has become a source of what many mainlanders fear most: instability. They don’t see a fight over individual rights. They see ungrateful separatists and troublemakers. And they believe the Communist Party will get its way eventually.
“I want to take the best of Hong Kong, but I won’t take part in that nonsense local stuff,” said Ms. Zhang, the Hong Kong resident from the mainland. “If there’s no return on your investment, what’s the point?”

"With No End to Unrest in Sight, Hong Kong’s Economic Pain Deepens","HONG KONG — It was the second day of Golden Week, usually one of Hong Kong’s busiest shopping periods, and Matthew Tam and his co-workers at a jewelry store were looking as lonely as a band of Maytag repairmen, surrounded by display cases of luxury watches with nary a customer in sight.
Sales at the store, in the once-teeming shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui, have plummeted 90 percent in recent months, thanks in large part to the evaporation of tourists from mainland China who have been staying away since antigovernment protests began in June.
“It’s quite worrying,” said Mr. Tam, 56, who relies almost entirely on commissions for his income. “I don’t know how much longer I can endure.”
Hoteliers, salesclerks, restaurateurs and tour guides across Hong Kong have been racked by similar fears as footage of tear gas-shrouded clashes between riot police officers and furious protesters are broadcast around the world, scaring off potential visitors.
During China’s Golden Week holiday, which started on Oct. 1, lines for rides at Disneyland were refreshingly short. Malls normally thronged with shoppers were closed for several days. And some of the city’s priciest restaurants, rattled by empty tables, were offering deep discounts.
With the city’s Beijing-backed leadership refusing to concede to the protesters’ demands for free elections and an independent investigation into allegations of police misconduct, an unmistakable sense of alarm is spreading among both small-business owners and corporate executives who see no way out of the impasse.
“People are hunkering down but it’s really starting to hurt, and the longer this goes on, the gloomier the picture starts to feel,” said Tara Joseph, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, who has lived in the city for nearly two decades.
The pall thickened after the Hong Kong leadership invoked emergency powers to ban the wearing of face masks during street rallies, a move that prompted fresh unrest and fury among those already angered by a slow erosion of civil liberties. The government has avoided harsher measures for now, but the prospect of restrictions like a curfew remains widely discussed.
“Emergency ordinances, face-mask bans and curfews are not the best way to restore business confidence,” Ms. Joseph said.
The tourism industry is a major driver of Hong Kong’s economy that alone keeps several hundred thousand people employed. But the overall number of tourists arriving in this semiautonomous territory has plummeted. Arrivals at Hong Kong’s international airport in August fell nearly 40 percent from a year earlier, even before the violence at protests escalated.
The falloff has been especially steep among mainlanders, who made up more than three-quarters of the 65 million people arriving here last year. The flow of visitors from mainland China nose-dived 55 percent during Golden Week.
The numbers are stark. Hotel occupancy rates are roughly 60 percent, down from 91 percent earlier this year. Retail sales dipped by 23 percent in August, the steepest decline on record. Many economists believe the city’s economy is slipping into recession.
The deepening crisis is reflected in a cascade of cancellations of major events like the Hong Kong Tennis Open, the Hong Kong Cyclothon, and the Hong Kong Wine and Dine Festival, all of which had been scheduled for this month.
For now, international finance and real estate, other pillars of the Hong Kong economy, have been largely unscathed. Corporate leaders worry, however, about the long-term impact to Hong Kong’s reputation as a stable hub for multinationals in greater China, especially if a crackdown leads to serious bloodshed or Beijing tries to interfere with the city’s hallowed independent court system.
Anxiety over shifting sentiments was heightened by a Goldman Sachs report estimating that at least $3 billion in investment had in recent months shifted from Hong Kong to Singapore, another former British colony and a regional rival for international finance. Law firms, global banks and trading companies have been drawing up contingency plans for the worst-case scenario.
There have been some reports of layoffs, and a few of the city’s ritziest hotels have been forcing employees to take unpaid leaves or have their wages temporarily trimmed.
“We really want the violence to stop as soon as possible so Hong Kong can be promoted around the world as a safe place,” said Ronald Wu, executive director of Gray Line Tours of Hong Kong, which has seen its business drop by more than half.
Alice Chan, executive director of the Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong, said only 16 tour groups arrived during the first few days of the Golden Week holiday, compared with the 110 that arrived daily last year.
Ms. Chan said antipathy toward Hong Kong spiked in August after protesters shut down the airport and attacked two men from mainland China. The spectacle of protesters burning the national flag on other occasions, she said, also has not helped. “These incidents have hurt the feelings of mainlanders,” she said.
On the mainland, China’s state-run propaganda machine has cast the protests as a riotous anti-China separatist movement orchestrated by the United States and other countries eager to tear the motherland apart. Chinese censors have blocked news reports and images that present the protesters’ yearning for democracy and their fear of being subsumed into the mainland’s authoritarian maw.
Hong Kong Disneyland would normally have been crammed with mainlanders during the holiday, but this year, the protests clearly dented the mood at the Happiest Place on Earth. The vast parking lots were mostly empty, just three of 16 ticket windows were open, and lines for many attractions were short or nonexistent.
Zhou Wenhua, 38, a real estate sales executive from Shanghai, was thrilled. “If we went to Shanghai Disneyland this week, we wouldn’t be able to move,” she said after taking her family on a spin through the It’s a Small World ride on an otherwise empty boat.
Unlike many mainlanders roaming the park in mouse ears and gnawing on roast turkey legs, grilled fish balls and pressed squid, Ms. Zhou was willing to talk about the protests, which she described as an “insurrection.”
In an echo of Beijing’s narrative, she cast the participants as spoiled children unappreciative of the Chinese government and its achievements. “Without the Communist Party, China would still be impoverished and weak,” she said. “They really should stop their rioting.”
Not that she had witnessed the protests firsthand. Ms. Zhou and her family had spent the previous two nights cloistered at their downtown hotel room, dining on room service.
Locals, fearful of impromptu subway shutdowns that can leave them stranded, are also less likely to meet friends or dine out. The West Kowloon Cultural District, a $3 billion, decade-long project that opened to sold-out performances this year, has seen ticket sales plunge. For the first time this month, district officials canceled several events in anticipation of protests and transportation shutdowns.
For many, the looming question is whether a prolonged or precipitous economic decline will chip away at popular support for the movement. A few business owners shook their heads in dismay over the vandalism and disruptions to public transport, though they asked to remain anonymous given the growing vigilante-style attacks on those the protesters deem hostile to their cause.
Surrounded by display cases stacked full with $70,000 Rolexes and $20,000 Tudor watches, Cherry Chang, 30, the owner of a small store in Tsim Sha Tsui, the shopping district, said sales have halved over the last few months. Still, she said she was willing to endure short-term financial pain for the loftier goals of genuine democracy and the preservation of the city’s generous civil liberties.
“I don’t mind losing money to support certain ideals,” she said.
Cheuk-Yan Lee, general secretary of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, which supports the protest movement, said he thought most Hong Kongers would blame the government for any hardship, not the protesters. The bigger threat, he said, is losing the freedoms and reliably independent courts that coaxed so many international companies to set up shop here in the first place.
“What will really hurt Hong Kong is not a brief drop in consumption but a loss of faith from global investors,” he said. “Instead of suppressing the protests, the government needs to revive confidence in the rule of law. Otherwise, we will just end up being another Chinese city.”

The One United Struggle for Freedom,"Hong Kong’s fight, and our own.
HONG KONG — Thirty years ago, I covered a lot of democracy rallies. They were held in the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Central Europe, South Africa and the Middle East. Last week, I covered some more, this time in Hong Kong.
In many ways the Hong Kong rallies felt exactly like the rallies I covered as a cub journalist. There was the same fervent faith in democracy, the same roiling conviction that human beings deserve to live at their full dignity — able to think what they want, read what they want, govern themselves and not simply exist half-strangled and suborned.
There was the same indignant desire not to live in a rigged economy run for the benefit of state-favored oligarchs.
There was the same turning to America that we see at democracy rallies everywhere, the same sense that America is a beacon in the struggle for freedom, the same expectation that of course America is going to step in and help.
There were even the same tactics. Decades ago, the Czechs built “Lennon Walls,” brightly covered walls where people post slogans and encouragement. Today, the Hong Kongers use those, too.
In 1989 democracy protesters across the Baltics formed a vast human chain called “The Baltic Way.” On Friday night, 135,000 Hong Kongers formed “The Hong Kong Way,” a chain that stretched 50 kilometers, or 31 miles, through the city. The protesters held hands, chanted slogans. When the lights were red, they stretched from sidewalks across the streets. When the lights were green, they politely withdrew to let traffic pass.
There was the same resolute pessimism that I remember from those democracy rallies decades ago. On the one hand these people are fervently committed. On the other hand, they don’t exactly see how a ragtag bunch can beat a powerful regime that has tanks. They don’t see the power of the powerless, that sometimes a shift in consciousness is stronger than military might.
I asked several Hong Kong protesters how they thought this thing would end up. They were not optimistic. “We’re seven million,” one man told me. “They’re 1.4 billion.” And yet they were not going to stop protesting and putting their lives at risk.
The big difference between now and then is technology. Today’s protests feel like a frenetic, online media campaign. There is a constant flow of memes, symbols and videos to keep the clicks coming: anime art, Pepe the Frog, bloody eye patches that refer to a woman who was shot in the eye.
The protesters sample and quote from the great buzz of global culture, which is of course what they are fighting to stay part of. A quote from “Hunger Games” was popular, then some Pink Floyd lyrics. The anthem of this uprising is “Sing Hallelujah to the Lord,” a 1974 Christian song from America.
Technology allows the protesters to suddenly appear and suddenly disappear, ebb and flow — to “be water,” in Bruce Lee’s phrase.
The protesters have online votes about where to take their protest next. They use AirDrop to download subversive pamphlets into the phones of unsuspecting tourists from mainland China.
There’s an amazing diversity of strategies. The accountants listen to speeches. The Christians sing. The radicals storm the subways.
Of course, the technology helps the Chinese government too. Years ago, we lived under the illusion that the nimble and decentralized swarms of New Power geeks would be more technologically savvy than the clunky, Old Power hierarchies. That’s not true. China’s Communist government seems to be more technologically advanced than the protesters.
There’s a sense the government has the ability to surveil everything. Protesters spend enormous energy trying to go unseen. They don’t use their normal subway cards for fear the state will be able to track their movements. Some protesters have been doxxed, with their private information and photos of their children splashed online. There’s no pro-democracy graffiti in Hong Kong, no posters or T-shirts, no day-to-day sign that anything is happening. When they are not rallying, the protesters evaporate because even the light poles have eyes.
My guess is that if technology helps the protesters become 30 percent more effective, it helps the state become 70 percent more effective.
Many suspect that China will eventually crush these protests. They’ll round up leaders and force businesses to fire participants. Many suspect America will never step in to help. The American right no longer believes in spreading democracy to foreigners. The American left embraces a national narrative that emphasizes slavery and oppression, not that America is a beacon or an example. Neither party any longer sees America as a vanguard nation whose very mission is to advance universal democracy and human dignity.
But there’s something stubborn about the Hong Kongers and deceptively powerful about their cause. Other protesters dreamed of freedom. These people have already lived it. It’s part of their identity. They will prove more ferocious in defense of liberty than the skeptics imagine. Along the way they might rekindle the sense of democratic mission that used to burn so forcefully in American hearts.

"Behind Hong Kong’s Protesters, an Army of Volunteer Pastors, Doctors and Artists","HONG KONG — The pastor pulled on his respirator and ran directly into the fog of tear gas in central Hong Kong. He was trailed by a homemaker, a retired accountant and a middle-school teacher.
Undaunted by the pandemonium of gasping protesters, they pointed people to safety and poured saline into the eyes of those overcome by the fumes.
With their yellow vests and portable loudspeakers, Pastor Ka-Kit Ao and his volunteers are an unmistakable presence at the antigovernment protests that have upended this semiautonomous Chinese territory. They form human cordons between protesters and advancing police. They beg baton-swinging officers to go easy. And they solicit the names of those being hustled away in handcuffs so pro bono lawyers can follow up with assistance.
“I sometimes wonder whether we are doing anything of value, but we can’t just sit at home,” Pastor Ao, 34, said one recent afternoon before heading into the maelstrom with members of his group, Protect the Children.
Now entering their sixth month, Hong Kong’s protests have been notable for their longevity, and for the huge throngs willing to defy the authorities with their demands for democracy and police accountability. Thousands of protesters, including office workers, descended Tuesday on Central, the main business and shopping district, forcing businesses to close and paralyzing traffic and the city’s fabled tram service.
Behind the scenes, this largely leaderless movement has been sustained by a vast network of ordinary people who hand out bottled water and red bean soup at marches, drive home stranded protesters late at night and donate the gas masks that fortify demonstrators during their pitched battles with police. Hong Kong professionals have been especially vital.
Graphic artists create the eye-catching protest posters across the city. Psychologists provide free counseling to the emotionally distressed. And emergency room doctors, working in clandestine clinics, set shattered bones.
One measure of community spirit can be heard many nights at 10 p.m., when residents in densely packed neighborhoods open their windows and shout protest slogans to the heavens. Another is expressed through the crowdfunding campaigns that have raised millions of dollars for medical treatment, legal defense funds and other expenses.
“Without this public support, the movement would have lost steam a lot sooner,” said Victoria Hui, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame and the author of a book about the Umbrella Movement, the 2014 pro-democracy protests that fizzled after 10 weeks. “It encourages young people to keep going, giving them the sense they are not alone and that what they are doing is righteous.”
Although actions like setting the man on fire risk eroding support, the protest movement so far has enjoyed broad backing among Hong Kong’s seven million people. A recent survey by the Chinese University of Hong Kong found that nearly 60 percent of respondents approved of the protesters’ violent tactics, agreeing that they were justified in the face of an increasingly aggressive police response and a government unwilling to compromise.
This public support presents a thorny challenge to the authorities, who have been hoping to quell the protests by driving a wedge between the increasingly radical agitators and those sympathetic to their cause.
“The more the government suppresses this movement and tries to scare people, the more people will step out and stand up,” said Pastor Roy Chan, a founder of Protect the Children, which has nearly 200 members.
The encrypted messaging app Telegram serves as the town hall for the support network, with dozens of channels that match volunteers to those in need. Most prolific are the channels offering rides to protesters affected by the subway shutdowns that the authorities impose to dampen protest turnout. The rides also help protesters avoid the police sweeps that target public buses.
Like many drivers, Patrick Chan, 38, a garment factory manager, said fear of arrest kept him away from the protests, most of which the police have deemed illegal. Guilt and shame, though, are powerful motivators.
Mr. Chan spends hours in his beat-up BMW sedan ferrying weary, sweat-drenched protesters to housing complexes across the city.
“These young people are trying to right the wrongs that we have long been avoiding,” he said, referring to Beijing’s two-decade effort to chip away at the vaunted liberties that differentiate this former British colony from mainland China. “They are paying with their futures, risking the possibility of being locked up for years. We owe them.”
The sense of public service has also mobilized dozens of doctors, nurses and medics. Much of their work takes place in secret. That is because all but the most grievously injured protesters avoid Hong Kong’s hospitals following the arrest in June of several people who had sought care for broken bones and blunt trauma. These days, the injured are sometimes treated at clandestine clinics that provide X-rays and rudimentary surgery.
Dr. Tim Wong works the protests after his regular hospital shift. An emergency room doctor, he decided to act after the police made a number of arrests at his hospital, which he declined to name for fear that it might endanger his employment.
“Since then, no one has come to our emergency room for treatment, unless they are escorted by the police,” he said. “It’s outrageous. Hospitals should be sanctuaries.”
One recent evening, he hovered near the front lines of a skirmish as Molotov cocktails, bricks and tear gas canisters arced overhead. Many of those needing medical treatment were bystanders caught up in the mayhem.
Just then, Pastor Ao and another member of his group rushed by carrying a man injured by a tear-gas canister. All three of them were weeping. “I can’t believe this is happening to our city,” the pastor wailed as they dragged the man to a first aid clinic inside a Methodist Church that has become a beacon for protesters.
Earlier that afternoon, Pastor Ao and scores of volunteers had gathered at a subway station to plot the day’s movements. After dividing up into teams of seven, he reminded everyone to refrain from chanting slogans and urged them to be polite to law enforcement authorities.
“They might call us cockroaches but we should refer to them as police officers,” he said. Then everyone bowed their heads in prayer. “May we have God’s protection and the patience, love and wisdom to deal with the police,” Pastor Ao said.
Volunteers say the police rarely return the favor, treating them as antagonists. In September, the police were widely criticized after a video emerged that appeared to show a knot of officers kicking a Protect the Children member as he lay on the ground. The man, wearing the group’s trademark yellow vest, was later arrested.
At a news conference, a senior police official dismissed allegations of abuse, suggesting that the video had been doctored and that what many saw as a person was actually “a yellow object.” In the weeks that followed, the group’s ranks swelled with new recruits, Pastor Ao said.
Many of the group’s volunteers are retirees like Ah Lin He. A fiery, reed-thin woman, Ms. He, 68, was born in the Chinese city of Guangzhou and swam to Hong Kong in 1972 to escape the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. She doggy-paddled for 10 hours with five other people. Only three of them made it to shore.
“I’ve seen the repression and madness that can be unleashed by the Communists in China,” she said as the group trudged to a protest that had turned violent.
Walking beside her was Joe Pao, a 29-year-old pastor, who joined the group after a brief stint as a protester. “I realized I could do something more useful than throwing bricks,” Pastor Pao said.
He acknowledged that his role as a putative peacemaker was rarely gratifying. Most of his work involves urging the police to exercise restraint. “When they catch people, we tell them to please respect the powers they have and not abuse them,” he said. “The impact is definitely small.”
The majority of protest supporters operate more independently. Nam Kwan, a cultural foundation administrator, has fed, housed and comforted scores of youths whose parents, enraged by their participation in the protests, tossed them out of their homes.
She traces her transformation from silent sympathizer to frenetic den mother to June 12, when the police escalated their tactics by firing rubber bullets and beanbag rounds at unarmed protesters.
“When I heard the first gunshot, a bell rang inside me and I automatically found my place,” she said. “Nowadays my phone is on 24 hours a day because I’m afraid I might miss urgent messages or calls for help.”
In addition to buying protective gear for protesters, she coordinates financial support and car pools from wealthy friends eager to help but reluctant to do so publicly. Oftentimes, she finds herself on the street, dispensing hugs or patiently listening to the worries of young protesters.
“Every time these kids go to the front lines, they fear for their lives,” she said. “But what they fear more is abandonment, that one day we will all turn our backs and leave them alone.”

"Hong Kong, I Am Listening","Conversation can triumph over conflict, calm can be restored, and trust can be rebuilt within the community.
HONG KONG — Does Hong Kong have a future? It’s not the first time such a question has been asked. But the question is being asked more and more often as the city faces a 17th week of social unrest.
The future certainly is on the minds of the hundreds of thousands of protesters who have taken to the streets over the past four months. The future is an issue that occupies much of my time, too. And it will be the question we, in Hong Kong, will discuss together on Thursday evening in the first of many community dialogues to air the public’s grievances and identify the issues this society faces. Issues reflected in those dialogues will be studied and translated into concrete actions — into building a future together.
Some solutions will also be found in my upcoming annual Policy Address, which will set out bold initiatives to tackle deep-seated problems, such as access to affordable housing.
Hong Kong has faced — and overcome — momentous challenges every decade since the end of World War II. This should tell us something about the people of Hong Kong: They are resilient and resourceful. It should also tell us something about the values that the Hong Kong people share and our common aspiration for a bright future.
This summer’s unrest is another transformative process — if a painful and, at times, depressingly violent one. I reject the use of violence to achieve any political, economic or social outcomes. Violence is not among the actions or values that most people associate with Hong Kong, which has a reputation as a safe and welcoming city. The radical actions of some rioters cannot dictate how to steer Hong Kong through its current difficulties.
Both the community dialogues and my Policy Address are part of a necessary reconciliation process. Deep wounds have been opened in our society. These will take time to heal. But it remains this government’s hope that conversation will triumph over conflict and that through its actions, calm can be restored and trust can be rebuilt within the community. To help create the atmosphere necessary for the community dialogues, I announced earlier this month the formal withdrawal of the bill to amend the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, the so-called extradition bill. The amendments, which were designed to address the shortcomings of existing mechanisms for the surrender of fugitive criminals, were the catalyst for the protests.
For months now, the world has seen Hong Kong’s people exercising their freedom of expression and freedom of protest. Peaceful protest has been a hallmark of Hong Kong society for decades, and it will remain so. The police have long facilitated such gatherings, which are 10 times more frequent now than in 1997. And the police did so this summer: From June to mid-September, more than 80 percent of requests for marches and gatherings were granted. But a worrisome pattern has emerged recently, with some organizers arranging large-scale marches that inevitably end in violent confrontations, vandalism and arson. The police must carefully weigh the people’s right to protest against the risks of violent disruption to public order. (It should also be noted that if the police object to a certain protest, the organizers may lodge an appeal before an independent body.)
I believe that the rule of law, upheld by an independent judiciary, is a bedrock of Hong Kong life; it can never be compromised. But precisely because the rule of law is a bedrock principle, violent protests and wanton vandalism must stop. This is one reason that this administration cannot accede to some protesters’ demand that all charges be dropped against those who have been arrested. Doing so would run counter to the rule of law. It would also contravene the Basic Law, which states that prosecutions must be taken forward, free from interference, by the Department of Justice.
Freedom of the press and freedom of information have also come into focus lately, partly because of the tsunami of media coverage about the protests, as well as other social, economic and political issues to do with Hong Kong. The city is a free and open economy and a global financial center, and the government understands that unfettered access to information is a prerequisite for the integrity and viability of its market — even though the media do not always paint Hong Kong in a positive or even impartial light.
And then, any discussion about Hong Kong’s future needs to consider the ongoing implementation of the “One Country, Two Systems” principle. The rule of law, freedom of expression, a free press — all are part and parcel of how this principle works in practice, and they help provide certainty in times of uncertainty. Hong Kong’s business community has made it clear that the successful implementation of “One Country, Two Systems” is the make-or-break condition of the city’s continued prosperity as a global hub for trade, finance, business, logistics and our arts and culture.
The rights and freedoms that make Hong Kong a special place within China are guaranteed under the city’s Basic Law: its high degree of autonomy, its use of common law, its own immigration and customs regimes, a separate currency, its air-services agreements and shipping register — its own Olympic team.
In other words: The institutional framework for Hong Kong’s future development already exists and it has been tested. Yet it needs to be leveraged further to make the best use of the “Two Systems” within the “One Country” and raise Hong Kong’s profile as an international city. The development plan for the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau Greater Bay Area unveiled earlier this year — to be implemented in strict accordance with “One Country, Two Systems” — promises to provide such opportunities.
No doubt, this summer’s protests have had an impact on the immediate future of Hong Kong’s economy, in particular its travel, hotel, retail and food-and-beverage sectors. People from all walks of life have been affected. The government is now working with those businesses to provide targeted measures to help alleviate some of their difficulties. And, as a small and highly open economy, Hong Kong will not escape the fallout of ongoing trade tensions between China and the United States. A recession is possible, if not likely, over the next year.
But we have significant fiscal reserves to draw on for countercyclical stimulus if needed. And billions of Hong Kong dollars have already been earmarked for infrastructure projects that will transform the face of our city in next few years: a third runway at our airport, a new business district in Kowloon East, a mega cultural district in West Kowloon, a new world-class sports park on the site of the old Kai Tak airport, significant new public spaces on both sides of our iconic Victoria Harbor.
Our financial markets continue to operate smoothly, and the linked exchange rate system that has served us well is as robust as ever. We have a stable currency; we continue to attract investment and I.P.O.s; there is growing interest in our development of innovation and technology, as well as arts and culture. The fundamentals are very sound, and numerous major projects and initiatives are underway that will provide thousands of jobs and opportunities for young people to explore for years to come.
For the time being, however, I am in listening mode for my first community dialogue session. No doubt, I will receive some harsh criticism. But I also hope to receive constructive suggestions to help this government meet the public’s expectations for a more inclusive and fairer Hong Kong.

"What Are the Triads, and What Is Their History of Violence?","HONG KONG — A lawmaker, a father, his teenage son and a woman who was too scared to show her face spoke Wednesday about an attack in a Hong Kong train station by a mob of men armed with sticks and poles. The assault on Sunday targeted people who were returning from antigovernment protests, and raised the fears of violence compounding political upheaval in the city.
Lam Cheuk-ting, a pro-democracy lawmaker who rushed to the scene of the attacks in the satellite town of Yuen Long, said blame lay with both the police, who failed to protect people, and the organized crime groups known as triads who allegedly carried out the attack.
“The police and the triads now rule Yuen Long together,” said Mr. Lam, who was beaten in the attack and required 18 stitches for cuts to his mouth. “The police allowed the triads to make plans, to prolong the attack and to beat up civilians. The police allowed these mobsters sufficient time to leave the scene.”
The mob attack has stirred fear and anger in Hong Kong. The streets of Yuen Long were desolate Monday night, with businesses closing early and residents staying home out of fear of further violence. The police have now arrested 11 men accused of being connected to the mob attack, and local news outlets have reported that some of those arrested have affiliations with two prominent triads, 14K and Wo Shing Wo.
Here is a look at the history of the triads and their past political violence in Hong Kong.
What are the triads?
Triads have historical roots in the secret societies and trade associations organized to protect territory, business and sometimes illicit activity. During the Qing dynasty, they helped resist the Manchu who ruled China, and they were enlisted by the Chinese Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, when it came to power after the collapse of the Qing in 1911.
The Kuomintang used Chinese criminal gangs to attack their political enemies at various times during the Republican era in China. It used the Green Gang in Shanghai to suppress unionists and help massacre thousands of communists in that city in 1927.
In Taiwan, where the Kuomintang fled in 1949 after losing a civil war to the Communist Party, gangs still sometimes wield political influence. The Bamboo Union triad helped suppress the pro-democracy movement in Taiwan in the 1980s, and in 1984 members of the gang assassinated Henry Liu, a journalist critical of the Kuomintang, in Daly City, Calif.
Chang An-lo, a former leader of the Bamboo Union triad who spent 10 years in prison in the United States for drug trafficking, leads a pro-China party in Taiwan whose members have attacked people critical of the Beijing government.
What is their history in Hong Kong?
A century ago, Hong Kong had hundreds of triads, their numbers lifted by waves of immigration from mainland China. Today, there are only a few dozen groups with interconnected ties and allegiances.
Some triad members in Hong Kong helped leaders of the Tiananmen Square protests flee China after a deadly military crackdown in June 1989. Before Britain returned the city to Chinese control in 1997, the mainland authorities sought to co-opt triads in order to curb their assistance to pro-democracy demonstrators and promote stability during the sensitive handover period.
“The members of triads are not always gangsters,” Tao Siju, China’s chief law enforcement officer, said during a visit to Hong Kong in 1992. “As long as they are patriots, concerned with maintaining the prosperity of Hong Kong, we should respect them.”
The triads have a patriotic reputation, but their deepest allegiance is to cash, said Lo T. Wing, a professor at City University of Hong Kong who researches triads.
“They don’t work for political ideology,” he said. “Individual triad members have their own ideologies, but triads as a group — they only work for money.”
What is their history of political violence?
In the past decade, gang members have sometimes carried out assaults in Hong Kong with political implications. Kevin Lau, the former chief editor of Ming Pao, a prominent Hong Kong newspaper, was seriously injured in a knife attack in 2014.
During the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement demonstrations later that year, a gang of men, including several believed to have triad connections, attacked a protest encampment in the Mong Kok district in Kowloon.
The attack in Yuen Long was meant to frighten people from attending protests, Professor Lo said, but the extremes of the mob violence drew attention from the damage done by demonstrators to the Chinese government’s liaison office.
What is their history of collusion with the police?
After World War II, corruption among Hong Kong police officers and collusion with triads was common. Public anger grew after the police chief, Peter Fitzroy Godber, was found in 1973 to have hundreds of thousands of dollars in overseas accounts. That helped inspire aggressive reforms, and today the territory is regularly ranked highly on anticorruption indexes.
Critics of the police in Hong Kong have accused them of acting in collusion with the thugs who attacked people on Sunday. None of the men thought to have carried out the attacks were arrested that night, and officers were seen calmly chatting with men carrying sticks and metal bars and wearing white T-shirts, the attire of the thugs.
Law enforcement officials have said the police were slow to respond because so many officers were needed for protests on Hong Kong Island, about 15 miles south of Yuen Long.
Professor Lo said, however, that police animosity toward the black-shirted protesters — whom they had clashed with for weeks — was the most likely factor in the slow response.
“If I were a policeman under attack for the past two months, with my family members bullied, not to mention other violence, what is the morale?” he said. ""If I got some reports that said black shirts were under attack, do you think I’d respond energetically? Of course not. This is natural, but of course it’s not normal.”

The High School Course Beijing Accuses of Radicalizing Hong Kong,"HONG KONG — They are sitting in orderly rows, wearing neatly pressed uniforms. But in this class, as they debate the merits of democracy and civil rights, Hong Kong high school students are prompting Beijing to worry that they are increasingly out of control.
The mandatory civics course known here as liberal studies has been a hallmark of the curriculum in Hong Kong for years, and students and teachers say the point is to make better citizens who are more engaged with society.
But mainland Chinese officials and pro-Beijing supporters say the prominence of the city’s youth at recent mass protests is the clearest sign yet that this tradition of academic freedom has gone too far, giving rise to a generation of rebels.
“The liberal studies curriculum is a failure,” Tung Chee-hwa, a former leader of Hong Kong, said in July. “It is one of the reasons behind the youth’s problems today.”
As Hong Kong’s high school students head back to school this week after a summer of protests, there are concerns that the struggle that has taken place on the city’s streets will move into classrooms.
 [Hong Kong students began the school year with gas masks, class boycotts and protests.] 
Already, students from universities and high schools across the city have planned class boycotts to ramp up pressure on the government to fulfill the protesters’ demands, which include universal suffrage and the full withdrawal of a contentious extradition bill.
In response, the authorities have been taking steps to depoliticize campuses. In a notice issued last month, the city’s education bureau told teachers that if asked “difficult questions” about the current events, they could say, “I don’t know” or “I don’t understand it, either.”
China’s ruling Communist Party has long seen education as a crucial ideological tool for nurturing loyal citizens. Under Xi Jinping, the country’s authoritarian leader, the party has ramped up patriotic education on the mainland, helping shape one of the most nationalistic generations of youth that the country has seen in years.
The party’s past efforts to push through similar patriotic education programs in Hong Kong, a Chinese territory with more civil liberties than on the mainland, have failed. But there are concerns that Hong Kong’s long-cherished tradition of academic freedom may once again be in the party’s cross hairs.
In recent months, officials in Beijing have repeatedly stressed the need for stronger patriotic education in Hong Kong.
“There is indeed a problem with the national education of Hong Kong’s youth,” said Xu Luying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese government’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, at a news conference last month. “Passionately loving the country and passionately loving the motherland should be taught in the first class in school.”
To the party, what is at stake is no less than Beijing’s legitimacy in the eyes of Hong Kong’s next generation. It wants to draw Hong Kong closer to Beijing by fostering patriotism that plays up the party’s achievements and whitewashes its tumultuous history.
It’s a mission that Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, had pledged to work on even before she took office in 2017, saying then that she would emphasize the message “I am Chinese” in kindergartens and primary schools.
Now, the liberal studies curriculum appears to be moving to the front line of that struggle again. It is a high school course designed to instill critical thinking skills and covers topics ranging from Hong Kong identity to climate change. When it comes to the mainland, the official curriculum focuses on the party’s recent economic achievements. But teachers are given a wide berth to teach topics that Beijing sees as subversive.
That includes studying the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989 or the life of Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate who died in 2017 while in Chinese government custody for his involvement in a petition calling for democratic reform.
Many educators and democracy advocates in Hong Kong say the course teaches students to be analytical and objective, even when it comes to examining the party’s flaws. To present a distorted version of history, they argue, is to undermine the intellectual rigor of a system that has consistently ranked among the top in global education indexes.
“They want to make young people dumber and less aware,” said Hoi Wai-hang, 38, who has taught liberal studies for 10 years.
But pro-Beijing officials have accused liberal studies of stoking anti-mainland sentiment.
Some, like Mr. Tung, the former Hong Kong leader, blame the curriculum. Others, including the Hong Kong Island Chaoren Association, a community organization with pro-Beijing views, blame the teachers. The group said in July that students should not have to take liberal studies classes at school because they could be swayed by the political beliefs of their teachers.
“I don’t want the teachers to affect their attitudes on the situation of Hong Kong right now,” said Joseph Yu, the vice president of the association.
Similar criticisms of the curriculum were made in 2014, following the wave of youth-led pro-democracy protests known as the Umbrella Movement.
Though no changes were made to the course then, experts say the renewed focus on the subject this time reflects a hardening belief among leaders in Hong Kong and Beijing that change is needed. It has also brought to the fore the increasingly untenable contradiction between these two systems: one that holds academic freedom as a core value and another that emphasizes ideological control above all else.
“To some extent, liberal studies awakened these young minds to the view that by joining in protests you can achieve change,” said Willy Lam, a political analyst who teaches at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
[ Go here for a photographic documentary of the Hong Kong protests. ]
“That’s Beijing’s biggest nightmare,” Mr. Lam added. “They will pull out all the stops to remedy the situation.”
Liberal studies was first introduced by British colonial administrators in 1992 as an elective in part to ease concerns about the future in the years leading up to the return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule. In 2009, the course was made mandatory.
Nothing like it exists in schools on the mainland. There, Mr. Xi has presided over a vigorous campaign to recenter Chinese society around ideology, specifically “Xi Jinping Thought,” his self-branded philosophy, which was written into China’s Constitution. In classrooms, children as young as 7 are taught to love the Chinese Communist Party and recite party slogans. New guidelines on ideological education were released by the party authorities as recently as last month.
Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Professional Teachers’ Union, the largest union for educators in the city, declared its support this summer for students’ participating in the peaceful protests.
But education officials, teachers and students have strenuously rejected accusations that the liberal studies course encourages students to take part in violence.
“There is no proof that liberal studies causes students to take radical actions,” Wendy Au Wan-sze, principal assistant secretary for education, said at a news conference in July following Mr. Tung’s remarks.
Yet many students speak proudly about how liberal studies helped them understand the complex bill that set off the protests. The bill, which would have allowed extraditions to the mainland, has since been suspended but has not been formally withdrawn from legislative agendas.
Students like Jerming Zhang, 16, also said they became more engaged in current events as a result of liberal studies. Mr. Zhang said that he learned about China’s mass detention of the mostly Muslim Uighurs in the far west region of Xinjiang by searching online.
“It shows what could be a possible reality for Hong Kong,” he said.
With the new school year starting, many said they are on alert for further attempts to erode academic freedom. And Mr. Hoi, the liberal studies teacher, said that if the day should come that the city introduces patriotic studies, he would be ready to push back.
“Even if Hong Kong implements national education, I will still teach what really ought to be discussed,” he said. “For example, what it means to be a civilian and what it really means to be patriotic.”

"At Least 70 Countries Have Had Disinformation Campaigns, Study Finds","In Vietnam, citizens were enlisted to post pro-government messages on their personal Facebook pages. The Guatemalan government used hacked and stolen social media accounts to silence dissenting opinions. Ethiopia’s ruling party hired people to influence social media conversations in its favor.
Despite increased efforts by internet platforms like Facebook to combat internet disinformation, the use of the techniques by governments around the world is growing, according to a report released Thursday by researchers at Oxford University. Governments are spreading disinformation to discredit political opponents, bury opposing views and interfere in foreign affairs.
The researchers compiled information from news organizations, civil society groups and governments to create one of the most comprehensive inventories of disinformation practices by governments around the world. They found that the number of countries with political disinformation campaigns more than doubled to 70 in the last two years, with evidence of at least one political party or government entity in each of those countries engaging in social media manipulation.
In addition, Facebook remains the No. 1 social network for disinformation, the report said. Organized propaganda campaigns were found on the platform in 56 countries.
“Social media technology tends to empower propaganda and disinformation in really new ways,” said Samantha Bradshaw, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, a department at Oxford University, and co-author of the study. The institute previously worked with the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate Russian interference around the 2016 campaign.
The report highlights the continuing challenge for Facebook, Twitter and YouTube as they try to combat disinformation, particularly when the perpetrators are governments. The companies have announced internal changes to reduce social media manipulation and foreign interference.
But the research shows that use of the tactics, which include bots, fake social media accounts and hired “trolls,” is growing. In the past two months, the platforms have suspended accounts linked to governments in China and Saudi Arabia.
Ben Nimmo, director of investigations at Graphika, a company that specializes in analyzing social media, said the growing use of internet disinformation is concerning for the 2020 United States election. A mix of domestic and foreign groups, operating autonomously or with loose ties to a government, are building from the methods used by Russia in the last presidential election, making it difficult for the platforms to police, he said.
“The danger is the proliferation” of the techniques, he said. “Anybody who wants to influence the 2020 election may be tempted to copy what the Russian operation did in 2016.”
China’s emergence as a powerful force in global disinformation is one of the most significant developments of the past year, researchers said. The country has long used propaganda domestically, but the protests this year in Hong Kong brought evidence that it was expanding its efforts. In August, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube suspended accounts linked to Beijing that were spreading disinformation about the protests.
Philip N. Howard, director of the Oxford Internet Institute and one of the authors of the report, said that such online disinformation campaigns can no longer be understood to be the work of “lone hackers, or individual activists, or teenagers in the basement doing things for clickbait.”
There is a new professionalism to the activity, with formal organizations that use hiring plans, performance bonuses and receptionists, he said.
In recent years, governments have used “cyber troops” to shape public opinion, including networks of bots to amplify a message, groups of “trolls” to harass political dissidents or journalists, and scores of fake social media accounts to misrepresent how many people engaged with an issue.
The tactics are no longer limited to large countries. Smaller states can now easily set up internet influence operations as well. The Oxford researchers said social media was increasingly being co-opted by governments to suppress human rights, discredit political opponents and stifle dissent, including in countries like Azerbaijan, Zimbabwe and Bahrain. In Tajikistan, university students were recruited to set up fake accounts and share pro-government views. During investigations into disinformation campaigns in Myanmar, evidence emerged that military officials were trained by Russian operatives on how to use social media.
Most government-linked disinformation efforts were focused domestically, researchers concluded. But at least seven countries had tried to influence views outside their borders: China, India, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
Ms. Bradshaw said that in the case studies the Oxford team identified, advertising was not central to the spread of disinformation. Instead, she said, the campaigns sought to create memes, videos or other pieces of content designed to take advantage of social networks’ algorithms and their amplifying effects — exploiting the potential for virality on the platforms for free.
Ms. Bradshaw said both government regulation and the steps taken by Facebook to combat this kind of disinformation didn’t go far enough. A lot of the regulation “tends to focus on the content” or “problems at the edges of disinformation problems,” she said, pointing to efforts like Facebook’s transparency in its ads archive.
“But from our research, we know that this problem of microtargeting ads is actually only a very small part of the problems,” Ms. Bradshaw said. Facebook has not addressed deeper structural problems that make it easy to spread false and misleading information, she said.
“To address that you need to look at the algorithm and the underlying business model,” Ms. Bradshaw said.

"At Saudi Aramco, Changes at the Top Point to a Coming I.P.O.","LONDON — A shake-up at the top of Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil giant, Saudi Aramco, this week is another sign that the company is moving aggressively to resume work on what would likely be the world’s largest initial public offering of stock.
Aramco’s chairman, Khalid al-Falih, who is also the country’s energy minister, was removed from his post at the company by the Saudi government on Monday.
The change eliminates — at least superficially — the issue of having the same person run both the oil company, the world’s biggest, and Saudi’s energy ministry. This was a concern voiced by some investors this year when Aramco sold about $12 billion in bonds, in its first entry into the public capital markets.
But the new chairman, Yasir al-Rumayyan, also brings a bonus that is essential to top leadership positions in Saudi Arabia today: He is frequently described as close to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country’s de facto leader. Mr. al-Rumayyan also leads Saudi Arabia’s $320 billion sovereign wealth fund.
Analysts say that Mr. al-Rumayyan, who has spent most of his career as a banker, may bring a more finance-driven approach to the company than Mr. al-Falih, a former Aramco chief executive with an engineering degree who represents Saudi Arabia at meetings of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Mr. al-Rumayyan, 49, will look at Aramco simply as “an asset to manage; Khalid sees this as a company that is critical to the economy,” said Ayham Kamel, the head of Middle East and North Africa research at the political risk firm the Eurasia Group. In other words, Mr. al-Rumayyan may find it easier than Mr. al-Falih to make changes at the company, which has managed to preserve a substantial degree of independence despite government ownership.
By taking Aramco public, the crown prince will be able to raise money to pay for a sweeping overhaul of his kingdom’s economy. And selling even a small portion of Aramco’s stock on a public market — the kingdom is considering the sale of about 5 percent of Aramco’s overall shares — could raise tens of billions of dollars.
Aramco unexpectedly pulled back its I.P.O. plans a year ago, at a time of low oil prices, and instead decided to pursue a stake in Sabic, a huge Saudi chemical producer controlled by the country’s Public Investment Fund.
Any momentum toward an offering evaporated after the killing and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist who disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last October. Crown Prince Mohammed was implicated in the killing by United States intelligence officials and a United Nations inquiry.
But the plan was revived, and last month the company’s chief financial officer told investors that it was prepared for a stock listing. The company had already been increasing its financial openness and clarity for the sake of international investors. The suggestion that it was ready for a public offering came during its first-ever earnings call.
[Read more: Saudi Aramco Says It’s  ‘Ready’ for I.P.O.  as It Reports Half-Year Earnings]
The renewed interest in an I.P.O. suggests that the crown prince thinks that the storm of controversy over Mr. Khashoggi’s killing is passing and that he is ready to move ahead with his plans.
The Public Investment Fund, which Mr. al-Rumayyan will continue to lead, would most likely receive proceeds from any Aramco stock that the Saudi government holds. The fund is turning into a “kind of national development bank” for carrying out the crown prince’s projects, said Karen Young, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a research firm based in Washington.
Aramco still needs to decide where to list the company, potentially a huge trophy for any exchange. To Aramco and the Saudis, the choice of where to list the stock is in many ways the more important part of the I.P.O. process, some observers say.
“It is not just about financial results,” said David Buck, a Houston-based partner at the law firm Sidley Austin, who specializes in oil company work. The terms of the public offering, including Aramco’s choice of an exchange, he said, will be “a commentary on both the company and the country.”
Aramco has said that it wants to float its stock on both Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange in Riyadh, known as the Tadawul, and a major international market. The Saudi exchange has been fortifying its technology resources to handle the huge amount of trading that an Aramco listing would bring.
What has drawn the most attention is where Aramco will choose to list its shares outside the Middle East. But amid the choices are potential pitfalls for the company.
Among the major exchanges vying to host Aramco:
■ The New York Stock Exchange, which is the biggest exchange in the world by market capitalization, and which Prince Mohammed has favored for its prestige. (President Trump in 2017 publicly pushed Aramco to choose the Big Board as well.) But I.P.O. advisers have warned that listing Aramco in the United States could leave the Saudi government vulnerable to lawsuits over the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and more.
■ The London Stock Exchange also has plenty of liquidity, and its executives recently courted Saudi officials as part of a British delegation to Jeddah. The exchange also relaxed rules for state-controlled companies in what critics said was a clear appeal to Aramco. But the continuing uncertainty over Britain’s departure from the European Union may be casting a cloud over London’s chances.
■ The Hong Kong Stock Exchange has also changed its rules in ways that benefit companies like Aramco. It has also promoted what it calls “primary connect” links to mainland China, which help major financial institutions in China invest in offerings staged in Hong Kong. But turmoil over the protests that have torn the territory in recent months may continue, raising questions about the exchange’s appeal.
■ The Tokyo Stock Exchange is the third-biggest in the world by market capitalization, and Aramco has a number of ties with Japan. Tokyo is the home of SoftBank, the Japanese technology giant that has partnered with the Saudis on an array of projects, notably the roughly $100 billion Vision Fund technology investment venture. (Mr. al-Rumayyan also sits on SoftBank’s board.) Aramco provides about one-third of Japan’s crude oil needs, the company says. But the Tokyo exchange does not have the same sort of profile as the New York, London and Hong Kong exchanges.

The Tenacity of Chinese Communism,"How the party revived an ancient philosophy to extol order and compel obedience.
When Chairman Mao Zedong stepped forward in Tiananmen Square on Oct. 1, 1949, and proclaimed — in standard Chinese but in a thick Hunanese accent — the founding of the People’s Republic of China, many patriots rejoiced. A large number of Chinese who were not Communists were still happy that after years of humiliation by foreign powers, a vicious Japanese invasion and a bloody civil war, China was now finally united. For the first time in roughly a century the Chinese had regained their dignity. Mao was widely credited for this.
Many Chinese patriots would one day regret their enthusiasm. Mao not only turned against what he called “class enemies,” or indeed anyone who did not follow him slavishly, but he also unleashed greater violence on the Chinese people than even the Japanese had. The Cultural Revolution, during which it is believed that up to two million people were murdered, was just the last of his great purges.
And yet, Mao’s feat of unifying the country and restoring national pride is still a reason for many people in China to respect his legacy, and for the Chinese Communist Party (C.C.P.) to justify its continued monopoly on power. The fear of violent disorder runs deep and is consistently drummed into Chinese of all ages. Party propagandists insist that China without Communist rule would descend once more into chaos and fall prey to hostile foreign powers.
There are, however, other reasons the C.C.P. is still in power in China, even after Communist rule has collapsed almost everywhere else.
The party has adapted extremely well to capitalism. Seeing what happened to the Soviet Union after Mikhail Gorbachev’s democratic reforms, China’s rulers refused to follow his example. After the Chinese who demanded similar reforms were brutally crushed during the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, the C.C.P. made a tacit deal with the educated urban class from which most of the protesters came. One-party rule would create the orderly conditions for people to become wealthy, in exchange for which they would refrain from political protest.
In this sense, China is not so different from Singapore, where a similar deal has been struck, if in a somewhat less oppressive manner. In fact, Deng Xiaoping, considered to be China’s great modern reformer and the man who cracked down on the dissidents in 1989, was an admirer of the Singaporean way of combining capitalism with autocracy.
But there is a deeper historical reason for the success of Communist Party rule in China. Imperial power in China was always backed by a quasi-religious dogma. Chinese emperors, acting as mediators between heaven and earth, were treated as semi-divine figures, holy popes as much as earthly rulers. Confucianism, originally a moral as well as a political philosophy, became an ideology imposed to instill obedience to authority — from fathers in families to clan chiefs all the way up to the emperor.
This may not have been what Confucius, or his follower Mencius, had originally intended. They were more interested in the cultivation of virtue in scholar-officials and the proper observance of ethical rules: Ancient Confucianism is a kind of blueprint for harmonious social order. And the recent protests in Hong Kong, as well as a vibrant democracy in Taiwan, show that many Chinese are actively opposed to authoritarianism — notably in places where traditional Chinese culture has generally been better preserved than on the mainland.
But rulers have used Confucianism, today no less than a thousand years ago, to support social hierarchy and autocratic rule. Official promoters of the creed have put an authoritarian spin on what started as a humanist philosophy.
This closed system based on orthodoxy was difficult for modern reformers to challenge, or disentangle. It was not enough to topple a particular imperial regime. To stage a real revolution in the name of democracy, which was attempted in the early decades of the 20th century, Chinese reformers felt it was necessary to sweep away the orthodoxy along with the sacred rulers.
That was the main point of the so-called May Fourth Movement of 1919, when students and intellectuals marched through the streets of Beijing under the banners “Mr. Science” and “Mr. Democracy.” Confucianism, the ideology that had held Chinese culture and politics together for thousands of years, had to go. Science became for some Chinese thinkers a new kind of dogma, something that explained everything.
Many Chinese intellectuals of the May Fourth generation were attracted to Marxism for that very reason. It filled the post-Confucian vacuum with an alternative, modern political and scientific orthodoxy with a strong moral component. Liu Shaoqi, one of the early Communist leaders (who was later purged and left to rot in prison during the Cultural Revolution), wrote in 1939 a tract titled “How to Be a Good Communist.” His description of the ideal revolutionary, with its stress on “self-cultivation,” sounded remarkably Confucian.
Even after the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949, the separation of church and state did not happen. Mao behaved like a divine emperor whose thoughts had to be learned by rote and revered like a classic Confucian text. Disrespecting or even just ignoring Mao’s “Little Red Book” in the 1960s was treated as a form of blasphemy, for which a person could be sent for re-education in a gulag — that is, if he or she had not been already executed.
After Mao died, and especially after Deng’s capitalist reforms, Maoism and Marxism began to lose their potency. Party members paid lip service to the party orthodoxy, and children were still taught it at school, but nationalism, and even bits of warmed-over Confucianism, began to replace the old Communist dogma. This, too, created what some Chinese and experts describe as a “spiritual vacuum.”
One way of filling the void has been conversion to Christianity, or joining spiritual groups like the Falun Gong, which party leaders view with great dismay. The reason the government tries so hard to crush religious organizations that operate independently from party control is precisely because dogmas that compete with the state orthodoxy are by definition subversive.
President Xi Jinping is very aware of this problem. That is why he is trying to tighten the party’s grip on ideology, as well as revive Maoist thought, while cracking down on dissident thinking in universities, mass media and online. His personality cult, stressing firm paternal leadership, as well as the authority of his philosophic thoughts, is widely seen as a way to reinstate the Communist variety of imperial rule after years of government by a succession of bland technocrats.
Mr. Xi is no Chairman Mao, however; he lacks the charisma to be a modern emperor. But a harsher version of the Singaporean model could succeed for quite a long time. The C.C.P. will continue to justify its rule by standing for order, national greatness and something called “Socialism With Chinese Characteristics” while (some of) the people continue to get rich. The exact nature of this type of socialism is not so important, nor is whether people really believe in it. There were many schools of Confucianism, too. The important thing is that this form of socialism compels obedience. And as long as the party remains in power, state control of spiritual and intellectual life will prevent people from coming up with any viable alternative.

Why China No Longer Needs Hong Kong,"For many years after regaining control of Hong Kong from Britain in 1997, China mostly respected the territory’s institutions. That is no longer the case, as Beijing’s heavy hand during the recent protests in the city has made obvious.
So what changed? In 1997, China needed Hong Kong. China had not yet been allowed to join the World Trade Organization, so Chinese exporters had limited access to the global market. Hong Kong was the solution: It served as a channel for entrepôt trade — goods from China could enter the territory’s ports and then be sent as exports from Hong Kong to the rest of the world, thus evading the trade restrictions imposed by member nations on nations outside the organization.
When China became part of the trade organization in 2001, entrepôt trade through Hong Kong lost its importance. By some estimates, nearly half of China’s trade went through Hong Kong in 1997, today that figure is less than 12 percent.
In terms of total size and wealth, Hong Kong has also shrunk relative to China, which has experienced more than three decades of astoundingly high economic growth. In 1997, Hong Kong’s economy was one-fifth the size of China’s, and its per capita income was 35 times higher. By 2018, Hong Kong’s economy was barely one-thirtieth the size of China’s. Hong Kong is still richer, but the gap is narrowing, with its per capita income now five times higher than China’s.
In the period right after 1997, China wanted to strengthen Hong Kong’s reputation as an open and market-oriented economy governed by the rule of law. This was a large part of its appeal as a major international financial center, a status that benefited the mainland economy.
Hong Kong was also used as a controlled testing ground where China’s currency, the renminbi, could find its feet as an international currency. Hong Kong had the trust of international investors, and the renminbi could trade more freely there than in China, where capital controls restricted the movement of financial capital across China’s borders. China’s dependence on Hong Kong is a thing of the past. The size of China’s financial markets now dwarfs that of Hong Kong’s. China’s four largest banks have become the four largest in the world in terms of their assets. In 1997, China’s stock markets were barely half the size of Hong Kong’s stock markets. Today, the capitalization of China’s stock markets stands at nearly $8 trillion, among the largest stock markets in the world, and about double that of Hong Kong’s.
It is not that Hong Kong’s markets have shrunk — the value of new public listings in Hong Kong was higher than any other exchange worldwide last year. Rather, it is simply that China’s financial markets, like its economy, have expanded so fast they have left Hong Kong in the dust.
China now has enough clout that investors around the world are willing to overlook deficiencies in its corporate and public governance. The renminbi is on its way to becoming a significant international currency, with Hong Kong just one of many financial centers where trading in the currency is authorized. And China has ambitions of promoting Shanghai as an international financial center, which makes Hong Kong a rival.
In short, China no longer needs Hong Kong the way it once did.
In the aftermath of the global financial crisis and with political upheaval facing the United States and other major democracies, China has come to envision an entirely different purpose for Hong Kong. It is to show that its vision of rule by the Communist Party, with some economic freedoms but restrictions on political and social freedom, might be preferable to the chaos of liberal Western democracies. Beijing also wants to use Hong Kong to showcase the efficacy of China’s version of the rule of law, in which the legal system serves the economy by enforcing property and contractual rights but is ultimately subservient to the Communist Party.
The troubles in Hong Kong go directly counter to Beijing’s narrative that its citizens are more than willing to give up personal and political freedom so long as the government delivers stable economic growth and maintains law and order. And Beijing’s actions there, including a controversial extradition bill, could eventually undermine international investors’ confidence in Hong Kong’s legal system. But the economic consequences for Beijing are modest, especially relative to the benefits of making a clear political point.
China may briefly loosen its chokehold on Hong Kong. But there is no mistaking Beijing’s plans for Hong Kong, which do not include preserving what its people and international investors once cherished — the value placed on free enterprise along with democracy, freedom of expression and the rule of law. The protesters are right to fear what’s coming.

Why Hong Kong Is Still Marching,"“I believe that we cannot withdraw this bill, or else society will say that this bill was groundless,” Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, said at a news conference on Saturday.
In many ways Saturday’s announcement might be viewed as a small victory for Mrs. Lam’s opposition. A draft bill that would allow citizens and foreign residents and even visitors to be extradited to mainland China has been suspended, indefinitely. But Mrs. Lam stopped short of withdrawing the bill. If she hoped that a delay would allow people to cool off and move on, that is wishful thinking.
Protesters said they will not accept anything less than withdrawal of the bill. On Sunday, hundreds of thousands — and by some estimates, 2 million — were back in the streets; authorities were so stunned that Mrs. Lam issued an unexpected apology for her handling of this episode. For Hong Kong, this battle, more than the protests that have come before, feels like a last stand.
For 79 days in 2014, thousands of protesters set up camp in Hong Kong’s main thoroughfares. The mood of Occupy Central was often sober, but sometimes idyllic, as the mostly young activists took up space, protested, and shared their hopes for free elections. Then came the police and the arrests.
Much has happened since. After the camps were removed, with none of the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement’s goals met, the movement split into factions and several of its leaders were sent to jail.
Many people were apprehensive that Hong Kong’s special status within China would be in jeopardy. Those fears have proved well-founded: In 2015 five Hong Kong booksellers known for selling political titles were abducted to the mainland; in 2017 a billionaire, Xiao Jianhua, disappeared from his room in a luxury hotel and has not been seen in public since; pro-Beijing forces have taken over the legislature; and Beijing’s representative office in Hong Kong has become much more assertive in local affairs.
As well as the mainland’s gradual encroachment, Hong Kongers have had to cope with rising housing costs, long waits for public medical services and record numbers living in poverty. Even the subway system, once the pride of the city, has been plagued by construction problems.
For five years change has seemed very far away. People felt stuck. The city was in the grip of a malaise.
Then came June 9, and an estimated one million Hong Kongers were in the streets — this time to protest the extradition bill. When Mrs. Lam, who was handpicked by Beijing, vowed that the bill would go ahead, a second protest was held on June 12, the day the bill was up for final debate and voting by lawmakers. The debate was postponed for the rest of the week.
But on Saturday, Mrs. Lam seemed to back down: The bill is suspended indefinitely. But protesters know that they need to hear that it will be withdrawn completely, whatever it takes.
The last five years have been hard, but they, and this bill, have served to create a more determined movement. In 2014, the peaceful sit-ins of the Umbrella Movement had support from certain groups but not across the board. They wanted to expand Hong Kong’s freedoms but many people felt that things were O.K., so why rock the boat?
This time around protesters organized quickly, communicated on encrypted messaging applications and wore face masks. They seemed even younger than the Occupy generation. And the opposition to the bill has not been limited to a loose coalition of students and democracy advocates. It encompasses almost every sector of society, including moderate professors, writers, former senior government officials, religious and business leaders. When protesters took to the streets last Sunday under 90-degree summer sun, restaurants and small shop owners offered them water and ice. Students, housewives and professionals of many walks of life signed petitions demanding the bill’s withdrawal.
But the government has also learned. This time it has not allowed public spaces to be occupied, and police are more readily resorting to force. They have normalized the use of tear gas, and on Wednesday police fired 150 rounds of tear gas in one day, almost double that of the entire duration of Occupy Central. The police hit unarmed protesters with batons and fired rubber bullets at individuals or crowds without warning. They aimed at body parts. Hong Kong had never seen such a level of police brutality, and so brazenly, too — the authorities apparently unfazed by being recorded on live video and broadcast around the world.
Until Saturday, Mrs. Lam refused to budge. She seemed determined to ram the bill through the establishment-controlled legislature before its recess in July. Never in the history of the city had a bill of such magnitude been enacted in such a short time without public discussion or review. On Saturday, Mrs. Lam said that she felt sorry that she had failed to convince the public that the bill was needed, and that she’d listen to more views; on Sunday, in her apology, she promised to hear criticism of her decision making “in the most sincere and humble way, striving to improve and serve the general public.”
So Hong Kong is not dead — not yet. But it is still under serious threat.
The “one country, two systems” arrangement and the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, are marked by uncertainty. They are, of necessity, works-in-progress that require creativity and good faith on the part of the governing powers in Hong Kong and Beijing.
Hong Kong’s people have lived with that uncertainty, struggling to defend their freedoms but sidestepping direct confrontation with Beijing. But they, especially the young, are ready to stand up for their rights.
Maybe, this time, the people of Hong Kong will have the last laugh.

Trump Has China Policy About Right,"Time to draw a line in the sand against Xi Jinping’s overreach.
For President Xi Jinping of China, Deng Xiaoping’s advice on how China should rise — “keeping a low profile” — was yesterday’s story. Discretion is not his thing.
Since Xi became president in 2013, he has made China’s ambitions abundantly clear, upping the ante on the strategic, military, technological and economic fronts. The United States is now in a direct ideological war with China over the shape of the world in the 21st century.
The trade war between the United States and China, and the brave protesters in Hong Kong fighting for the preservation of the rule of law against the threat of absorption into lawless Chinese authoritarianism, are facets of this overarching confrontation. If you focus on the signal and not the wildly gyrating noise, President Trump has gotten China policy about right. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day. It was time to draw a line in the sand against Xi and his overreach.
A victim of Mao’s ruthlessness during the Cultural Revolution, Xi absorbed the lesson that ruthlessness is the sine qua non of authoritarian one-party rule. He has abolished the very term limits designed by Deng to prevent the emergence of another Mao-like figure, installing himself as quasi-emperor for life.
He has rounded up protesters and human rights lawyers, deployed technology (stolen or not) to build his Surveillance State, hounded the Uighurs through a system of concentration camps devoted to Orwellian “re-education,” and cultivated a climate of fear — all for his “Chinese dream.” The image of Hong Kong protesters tearing down facial-recognition towers is an iconic one for an age in which Xi wants to make the world safe for dictators.
Xi’s domestic crackdown has been accompanied by an aggressive international agenda. The Belt and Road Initiative to lock Eurasia into dependence on China, the construction of military outposts on islets in the South China Sea, the announcement in 2017 that the Chinese model was now ready for export to nations that “want to speed up their development while preserving their independence,” the “Made in China 2025” technological thrust through acquisition, theft and growing domestic know-how — all of these were gauntlets thrown down to the West.
Trump was right to recognize the threat and respond, however erratically. Xi is not the god of some new rules-based order, as he was anointed at Davos in 2017. He is a threat to liberty, as helmeted Hong Kongers facing down tear gas and growing repression have recognized.
Xi believes in the sacredness of the Chinese Communist Party, not the sacredness of the individual. He also believes, on the evidence, that Chinese money can buy 21st-century international acquiescence to a new order.
American engagement with China over decades has worked up to a point. It involved a useful symbiosis. China developed at a pace; hundreds of millions of people overcame poverty and joined the middle class. Americans got cheap goods made in China. Global stability was enhanced as China joined the world without major disruption. Given the violent history of rising powers, these are significant accomplishments.
There was a flaw, however. The bet that this engagement, by producing a Chinese middle class, would in turn spur greater liberties as more affluent people sought more freedom has proved wrong — at least for now. Xi’s message is clear: We’ll take your engagement, eat it, double down on repression and one day run the world.
Another flaw, one that helped Trump ride an America-first wave to the White House, was that China gobbled up American heartland manufacturing jobs. Steve Bannon’s comment to me is provocative hyperbole — “Every capitalist would choose slave labor if he could, and in China capitalists got a totalitarian mercantilist manufacturing base based on slave labor” — but not without a kernel of truth. Globalization and the free movement of capital were not fine and dandy for everyone, as the great nationalist and nativist lurch of recent years demonstrates.
Trump flails, but he’s right that China can’t join all the right international clubs and go on playing by its own rules. It can’t make some trade “deal” and then not be held fully accountable, relying on the infinite global capacity to turn a blind eye to its predations.
Ordering American companies out of China one day — a trademark Trump grotesquerie — and praising Xi the next is no way to negotiate, but China has had a pass for too long. The president’s statement linking a trade deal and the Hong Kong demonstrations — “It would be very hard to deal if they do violence. I mean, if it’s another Tiananmen Square, it’s — I think it’s a very hard thing to do if there’s violence” — was perhaps his finest hour. I just hope he meant it, despite the contempt he has otherwise shown for human rights.
A lot is at stake in Hong Kong, the world’s third-largest capital market. It’s a pivotal moment of the American-Chinese ideological war. A second Tiananmen could turn Xi’s overreach into cataclysm. He’s more vulnerable than he looks — as Trump intuits. Right now, of the Democratic presidential candidates, only Elizabeth Warren appears to get the China threat, one reason she’s surging. China will be big in 2020.

"To Gain Leverage in China Trade Talks, Trump Shows Solidarity With Hong Kong","WASHINGTON — President Trump has shifted his stance on the unrest in Hong Kong in recent days to show greater solidarity with the pro-democracy protesters after coming to view the issue as a point of leverage in trade negotiations with China.
For months, Trump administration officials described the Hong Kong uprising as an internal matter for China, aware of how delicate the issue is for President Xi Jinping and other Communist Party officials. With tensions already high between the two nations and trade talks stalled, the administration chose to tread lightly.
But as the protests have dragged on, advisers to Mr. Trump have succeeded in making the case that wading into the issue could prove necessary — and advantageous — to the United States as it tries to push Beijing to accede to its trade terms.
After previously saying Hong Kong was a “very tough situation” that was up to Chinese leaders to handle, Mr. Trump has more recently called on those leaders to offer a “humane” response and urged Mr. Xi to engage in dialogue with the protesters.
The change in the administration’s tone appeared to be carefully coordinated this week, after Mr. Trump on Sunday issued a warning to China. The words were couched in practical terms centered on a trade deal, not in the language of human rights, but they were nevertheless surprising given Mr. Trump’s earlier passive remarks on Hong Kong.
“I think it would be very hard to deal if they do violence,” Mr. Trump said on Sunday. “I mean, if it’s another Tiananmen Square, it’s — I think it’s a very hard thing to do if there’s violence.”
The next day, Vice President Mike Pence echoed those words in a speech in Detroit. “It will be much harder for us to make a deal if something violent happens in Hong Kong,” he said. “And I want to assure you, our administration will continue to urge Beijing to act in a humanitarian manner and urge China and the demonstrators in Hong Kong to resolve their differences peaceably.”
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was even more explicit in tying Hong Kong to trade in an interview with Fox News on Monday. He accused China of violating promises it made to Hong Kong and commitments about protecting human rights.
“When we try to negotiate a trade agreement with them,” Mr. Pompeo said, “we’ve tried to put in processes that ensure we have the opportunity to verify because we need to make sure that we don’t suffer from China breaking a promise or have to watch Chinese disinformation about the agreement that’s entered into.”
By conveying the belief that China is straying from its decades-old commitment to preserve Hong Kong’s separate political system, the top American officials are buttressing their argument that a trade treaty with China must have strict enforcement provisions.
They are also sending the message that a violent crackdown in Hong Kong along the lines of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre would make China a pariah in the eyes of many Americans and other citizens around the world, rendering it all but impossible to resume trade discussions amid the global backlash.
“Showing support for a peaceful resolution of the situation in Hong Kong could potentially give the U.S. a stronger hand in trade negotiations, under the assumptions that Beijing wants a trade deal badly enough and wants to maintain Hong Kong’s special status in its trade with the U.S.,” said Eswar Prasad, the former head of the International Monetary Fund’s China division. “Both are reasonable assumptions but might be trumped by Beijing’s unwillingness to countenance further protests in Hong Kong that directly challenge Beijing’s authority.”
The Trump administration has already imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports and is planning to tax another $300 billion worth. American and Chinese officials have spoken by phone in recent weeks, but no date has been set for a Chinese delegation to visit Washington in September, as had been previously announced. And Mr. Trump has made clear he does not mind keeping the trade war going.
“Unless they’re going to make the right kind of a deal, I’m not ready to make a deal,” he told reporters this week.
Foreign policy officials have grappled in recent weeks with how to get Mr. Trump to take a more forceful stand on Hong Kong. Officials are wary of potentially harsh measures Mr. Xi might take against the protesters. They have become more concerned as videos have emerged of Chinese troops massing across the border in Shenzhen.
Several top aides had urged Mr. Trump to make statements warning the Chinese leadership against using violence. Among them is John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, who views China as a formidable rival. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, said in June that he saw the United States and China as “strategic partners.”
American officials are also cognizant that they must avoid giving the Communist Party ammunition that it can use to reinforce its conspiratorial message that the United States and other Western powers are “black hands” behind the protests.
For weeks, as tensions rose in Hong Kong, Mr. Trump remained passive, suggesting that the uprising was an internal matter for China. That position was not unusual — the president has never made strong statements about protecting human rights in China or elsewhere — and his foreign policy is based mainly on long-held ideas about commerce and transactions. In his two and half years in power, Mr. Trump has been focused on cutting United States expenses abroad and getting more advantageous trade deals.
On Aug. 1, Mr. Trump employed the language used by Chinese Communist Party officials when he said that Hong Kong has had “riots for a long period of time.”
“Somebody said that at some point they’re going to want to stop that,” he added. “But that’s between Hong Kong and that’s between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China.”
Analysts of China said Mr. Xi and other party officials would read those words as a green light to take whatever measures they deemed necessary to suppress the protests.
The language from Mr. Trump was much less assertive than that used by members of Congress from both parties, the State Department and Mr. Bolton. In an interview with Voice of America on Aug. 14, Mr. Bolton said Americans “remember Tiananmen Square” and “the picture of the man standing in front of the line of tanks.” He added, “It would be a big mistake to create a new memory like that in Hong Kong.”
As a trade deal has appeared increasingly remote, Mr. Bolton and other China hawks in the administration have pushed Mr. Trump to move ahead on separate issues that advisers feared might jeopardize the trade talks. That includes the sale of 66 F-16 fighter jets to the self-governing island of Taiwan. The $8 billion deal is the largest or one of the largest arms sales from the United States to Taiwan.
Lawmakers had accused the Trump administration of delaying the sale to avoid upsetting the trade talks. But last week, Mr. Bolton, who advocates greater American support for Taiwan, prodded Mr. Trump to go ahead with the sale. Mr. Pompeo signed a memo approving the deal on Aug. 15, and the administration gave formal notification to Congress this Tuesday.
Yet the administration has failed to take action on what is by far the biggest human rights abuse by China in decades — the detention of one million or more Muslims. Mr. Bolton, Mr. Pompeo and other foreign policy aides have recommended to Mr. Trump that the United States impose sanctions on Chinese officials over the detentions.
Trade advisers such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have argued that the sanctions would endanger trade talks. In an interview in June, Mr. Mnuchin would not comment on the detentions of Muslims.
Human rights advocates say they hope the recent appointment of a Uighur-American scholar, Elnigar Iltebir, to the National Security Council will lead to action. Most of the detained Muslims are ethnic Uighurs.
Some analysts are skeptical of the new linkages among trade, human rights and Hong Kong that the administration is pushing. Given Mr. Trump’s vacillations on many issues, “would such a threat be credible to Xi?” said Susan L. Shirk, the chair of the University of California at San Diego’s 21st Century China Center.
Others warn the moves could backfire.
“The U.S. government has to be careful not to do things that could be portrayed as inciting riots,” said Michael Pillsbury, a China expert at the Hudson Institute and an informal adviser to the president. “What the Trump assessment team in Beijing is trying to figure out is the grand strategy. Is Trump trying to overthrow the party, or is it just about trade?”
Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of China’s state-run Global Times newspaper, wrote on Twitter that Mr. Trump’s threats of backing away from a trade deal carried no weight in China.
“As for Washington’s threat to link trade talks with the situation in Hong Kong, what I heard on various occasions is scorn on this idea,” he said. “China is making arrangements on scenario of no deal.”
For his part, Mr. Trump is trying to keep his true intentions murky. Asked on Wednesday if he saw Hong Kong as leverage in trade talks with China, he demurred.
“I don’t view it as leverage or nonleverage,” he said. “I hope it works out in a humane way.”
He added, “And I think that President Xi has the ability to make sure that happens.”

Hong Kong’s Government May Cave In to China. Its People Will Not.,"If Hong Kong’s undoing comes much earlier than 2047, the year that the city’s special arrangement with mainland China formally ends, it may be because of a love story that ended in murder.
On Sunday, several hundred thousand — possibly upward of one million — Hong Kong people marched to protest their government’s attempt to turn that single incident into an excuse to subjugate the city to the ever-encroaching authoritarianism of the Chinese authorities in Beijing.
Chan Tong-kai, a young man from Hong Kong, is wanted in the strangling death of his girlfriend while the couple was vacationing in Taiwan last year. He is back in Hong Kong and, though a suspect in the killing, cannot be sent to Taiwan to stand trial because Hong Kong and Taiwan do not have an extradition agreement. (Nor can he be tried in Hong Kong, whose courts do not have jurisdiction over crimes committed outside of the city.)
Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s highest-ranking official, offered to solve the problem in March by proposing, and fast-tracking, a bill to amend existing extradition laws, which, among other things, would allow the rendition of criminal suspects between Taiwan and Hong Kong. She said this would improve the rule of law.
She also said she wished to “plug a loophole” by allowing a similar arrangement between Hong Kong and China — a loophole, another official lamented, that Hong Kong has ignored “like an ostrich for 22 years,” or since Britain handed over control of the city to the Chinese authorities in Beijing.
For many Hong Kongers, the proposed bill hit like a political bombshell: It seemed to pave the way for China to target anyone in Hong Kong on almost any pretense and try them on the mainland. In the past, the Chinese authorities at least have had to stoop to ugly, and manifestly illegal, kidnappings to get their hands on their opponents in the city.
Various pro-democracy camps in Hong Kong and many legal professionals were quickly up in arms. So were some members of the business sector. Christian churches also cried out: Shipping copies of the Bible to the mainland could attract severe punishment under Chinese law. Even recent immigrants from China spoke up. Five years after the Umbrella Movement, the spirit of civic protest — for freedom, justice and democracy — is alive and well in Hong Kong.
And with reason. The threat posed by the extradition law is real. The Chinese authorities have forcefully endorsed it. Ms. Lam’s arguments for the new bill are weak. Her motives are suspect.
The Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, one of the laws now under scrutiny, was enacted in April 1997 (several months before the handover) and amended in 1999 (after the handover). Ms. Lam’s position is “self-evidently untrue and absurd,” Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, commented recently. “Both Hong Kong and China knew very well that there had to be a firewall between our different legal systems,” he said.
A Taiwanese official has said that the Hong Kong authorities have ignored three requests by Taiwan for the two governments to figure out together a special arrangement to handle the Chan case, bypassing the need for any radical legislative changes in Hong Kong. The Lam administration has also ignored narrow alternative approaches proposed by Hong Kong’s top legal professionals.
It does so at its peril: Aside from the sheer number of protesters on the streets on Sunday, it also has to contend with concern from the business community, an essential constituency.
Jimmy Lai, a local media mogul and pro-democracy icon, has argued that if the bill passes, “Hong Kong will just become another Chinese city ruled by the Communist Party.” Michael Tien, an old-money and pro-government tycoon, as well as other representatives of the business sector, have also expressed clear, if more polite, disagreement.
The extradition bill would apply retroactively, and many business people in Hong Kong who have, or once had, business operations in China may have paid bribes — or visited brothels or otherwise contravened Chinese law in ways that high-flyers there routinely do.
Hong Kong’s tycoons and major business leaders have long had an interest — and a say — in maintaining the rule of law in the city, if only because it makes for a more attractive investment climate. That’s one reason that back in 2003 some of them rallied around James Tien  — then a member of the Executive Council, the local cabinet (and now an honorary chairman of the pro-business Liberal Party) —tooppose a controversial security bill under Article 23 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-constitution.
Business people in Hong Kong have even more reason to fear the extradition bill today. It could both destabilize the city’s business environment and expose them to reprisals or extortion by the Chinese authorities — especially if they have ties to the United States and the country’s trade war with China continues to rev up.
Back in 2003, the security bill was defeated in the local Legislature, known as LegCo, by James Tien and other members of the Liberal Party — in part after a half million people protested in the streets.
Ms. Lam has tried to placate the business sector, and has gestured at a compromise by shortening the list of proposed crimes that would warrant extradition to China — excluding white-collar and business-related crimes. Major business groups seemed content enough with the changes — but not Mr. Tien. On Sunday night, after the march, he called on Ms. Lam in a Facebook post to shelve the extradition bill now that the “silent majority” of Hong Kong had come out marching against it.
The Hong Kong government issued a statement that night urging that consideration of the bill proceed as planned. LegCo is scheduled to debate it again on Wednesday. As the legislative process continues, so too will the conflict.
LegCo has been rigged so that it now essentially does the executive’s bidding — and the executive does Beijing’s bidding. But if the proposed amendments are Ms. Lam’s initiative, as she has maintained, she might have gone too far trying to please her masters in Beijing. Judging by the crowds on Sunday, Hong Kongers’ scorn for the government on the mainland may have reached new heights. This cannot be what Beijing wanted.

"In Economic Warning Signals, Trump Sees Signs of a Conspiracy","President Trump, confronting perhaps the most ominous economic signs of his time in office, has unleashed what is by now a familiar response: lashing out at what he believes is a conspiracy of forces arrayed against him.
He has insisted that his own handpicked Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, is intentionally acting against him. He has said other countries, including allies, are working to hurt American economic interests. And he has accused the news media of trying to create a recession.
[Update:  Trump administration considers moves to bolster economy .]
“The Fake News Media is doing everything they can to crash the economy because they think that will be bad for me and my re-election,” Mr. Trump tweeted last week. “The problem they have is that the economy is way too strong and we will soon be winning big on Trade, and everyone knows that, including China!”
Mr. Trump has repeated the claims in private discussions with aides and allies, insisting that his critics are trying to take away what he sees as his calling card for re-election. Mr. Trump has been agitated in discussions of the economy, and by the news media’s reporting of warnings of a possible recession. He has said forces that do not want him to win have been overstating the damage his trade war has caused, according to people who have spoken with him. And several aides agree with him that the news media is overplaying the economic fears, adding to his feeling of being justified, people close to the president said.
The claims provide a ready target to help Mr. Trump deflect blame if the economy does tip into recession. But whether they could truly insulate the president on what could be a significant issue of the 2020 election after he has so conspicuously wrapped himself in the good economic news of the past two years remains an open question, and he and his advisers have sought to tamp down concerns that a downturn is on the way.
“Our economy is the best in the world, by far,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Sunday. “Lowest unemployment ever within almost all categories. Poised for big growth after trade deals are completed.”
“I don’t see a recession,” he told reporters later on Sunday before leaving his private golf club in Bedminster, N.J., for Washington. But he added that if the economy slowed down, “it would be because I have to take on China and some other countries,” singling out the European Union as among those treating the United States “very badly.”
The president’s broadsides follow a long pattern of conspiratorial thinking. He has claimed, without evidence, that undocumented immigrants cast millions of ballots, costing him the popular vote in the 2016 election. During the campaign, he predicted that the system might prove to be “rigged” if he did not win. He conjured up a “deep state” conspiracy within the government to thwart his election and, more recently, his agenda. And he has said reporters are trying to harm him with pictures of empty seats at his rallies.
The attacks come as the economy has begun flashing some warning signs, despite unemployment near historic lows and relatively high marks by voters on Mr. Trump’s economic stewardship. Global growth has been slowing. Last week, stock markets plunged as the yield on the 10-year Treasury note briefly fell below that of the two-year Treasury note, an unusual situation known as an inversion of the yield curve that is considered one of the most reliable leading indicators of recession in the United States.
And signs of damage from Mr. Trump’s trade war with China have been mounting.
In some conversations, the president has been preoccupied with the trade war, as well as with how to handle the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, according to the people who have spoken with him. “I’d love to see it worked out in a humane fashion,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Sunday, referring to potential retaliation against the demonstrators by China. “It does put pressure on the trade deal,” he added.
Mr. Trump also indicated that the Chinese tech giant Huawei, which his administration sees as a national security threat, might not receive an extension of a reprieve that allows American companies to supply it with certain goods despite a ban on such trade.
“Huawei is a company we may not do business with at all,” the president said, casting doubt on reports that the reprieve, which is set to expire on Monday, would be extended.
On Sunday, his advisers battled any notion that the trade war could be harming the economy. Peter Navarro, a top trade adviser who has urged the president on in his trade war, dismissed a study from researchers at Harvard, the University of Chicago, the International Monetary Fund and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston that showed that the cost of Mr. Trump’s tariffs had “fallen largely on the U.S.,” not on China and other countries, as the administration has asserted.
“There’s no evidence whatsoever that American consumers are bearing any of this,” Mr. Navarro said on CNN’s “State of the Union,” insisting, despite abundant data to the contrary, that “they’re not hurting anybody here.”
While maintaining that any turmoil in the economy is overstated, Mr. Navarro and Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser, also said the Federal Reserve had slowed economic growth, mirroring Mr. Trump’s criticisms.
Mr. Kudlow, appearing on “Fox News Sunday,” said that the state of the economy under the Trump administration “is kind of a miracle, because we face severe monetary restraint from the Fed.”
Mr. Navarro, appearing on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” blamed the Fed for raising interest rates “too far, too fast,” adding that “they have cost us a full point” of growth in gross domestic product.
Mr. Trump has also struck an increasingly strident economic tone.
“You have no choice but to vote for me because your 401(k), everything is going to be down the tubes” if Democrats win, he told a crowd at a campaign rally in Manchester, N.H., last week. “Whether you love me or hate me, you’ve got to vote for me.”
The rally was one of a few departures from a relatively low-profile period during a nearly two-week trip to his club in Bedminster, where he typically spends part of August. He also took official trips to El Paso, Tex., and Dayton, Ohio, after the gun massacres there, and he went to Pennsylvania ostensibly to talk about energy sources, but instead delivered remarks indistinguishable from those at one of his rallies.
But the dyspeptic diatribes came in spurts, and the president whipsawed between frustration and freewheeling meetings and golf outings, including one on Saturday with the president of the P.G.A. and the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to two people familiar with his playing partners. Still, Mr. Trump was frustrated by the news media’s coverage of his rally in New Hampshire. He repeatedly complained about misleading pictures of empty seats, or that attendance at the arena had beat Elton John’s record crowd there, but no one was covering it.
Long-serving aides say that Mr. Trump understands that presidents face harder re-election battles in a bad economy, and he has made the issue central to his presidency.
But even as he returns to Washington facing new pressures, Mr. Trump did not seem to anticipate a quick resolution to the trade war. “The tariffs have cost nothing, in my opinion, or certainly very little,” in terms of pain to American consumers and businesses, Mr. Trump insisted, adding that “China is eating the tariffs.”
“China would like to make a deal,” he said. “I’m not ready.”

The World’s Wokest Sports League Bows to China,"The N.B.A. apologizes on behalf of Daryl Morey, a general manager who voiced support for democracy.
The national editor of this newspaper last year asked the commissioner of the N.B.A. at a conference how it felt “to be the wokest professional sports league.” It was a fair description: While Colin Kaepernick has been unable to find a job in the N.F.L. after kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality, basketball stars like LeBron James, Derrick Rose and Kobe Bryant have freely expressed their support for the Black Lives Matter movement, even on the court.
It’s a reputation — and a brand — that the league has cultivated. “I didn’t know we were given that designation,” Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, responded. “But I understand the sentiment and we’re proud of that.” He went on to insist that “political speech” is players’ “absolute right within the league.”
Absolutely, that is, unless the subject of that political speech is the Chinese Communist Party, which presents perhaps the greatest strategic threat to our freedoms of any regime in the world. On that subject, Mr. Silver and the league he runs are shamefully silent.
A stunning instance of N.B.A. acquiescence to Beijing began on Friday evening when Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, put out a tweet expressing support for Hong Kong’s democracy movement: “Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.” You might assume that the wokest professional sports league — this is a business, after all, that pulled its all-star game out of Charlotte, N.C., in 2017 because of that state’s anti-transgender bathroom bill — would see human rights, representative democracy and freedom of conscience as core virtues. But you would be wrong.
The Morey tweet, though promptly deleted, went viral in China, where outrage from sponsors and fans was fast and furious. But the swiftness with which the N.B.A. bent its knee to Chinese sensitivities was truly breathtaking for a league that prides itself on a “sense of an obligation, social responsibility, a desire to speak up directly about issues that are important,” as Mr. Silver has boasted. Perhaps the fact as many as 500 million Chinese watched at least one N.B.A. game last season and the N.B.A.’s business operations there are valued at more than $4 billion had something to do with it.
The owner of the Houston Rockets, Tilman Fertitta, didn’t hesitate to throw his general manager under the bus: “Listen … @dmorey does  not speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are not a political organization,” he posted late Friday night, a few days before a Rockets preseason game in Japan.
Soon after came Mr. Morey’s walk back: “I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.”
Among the offended was the Chinese Basketball Association, which immediately suspended its relationship with the Rockets. The association is headed by Yao Ming, a former Rockets player who made the team by far the most popular N.B.A. franchise in China. By Monday, the current Rockets star James Harden offered a full-throated apology on behalf of his boss: “We apologize. You know, we love China. We love playing there.”
The N.B.A.’s official Chinese apology, put out on the social media site Sina Weibo (China’s version of Twitter), was something to behold: “We are extremely disappointed in the inappropriate comment by the general manager of the Houston Rockets,” it said. Mr. Morey “undoubtedly seriously hurt the feelings of Chinese basketball fans.”
All of this comes just as the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets are headed to China for a two-game exhibition. The Nets are owned by Joe Tsai, a co-founder of Alibaba, who weighed in on the Morey controversy in a long Facebook post that called the tweet “damaging,” the democracy protesters a “separatist movement” and the subject of Hong Kong’s independence a “third-rail issue.”
That an Alibaba chief sees the situation this way — the company’s technology has been used by the Chinese government to surveil its citizens — should not come as a surprise to anyone. The question is how an American league that prides itself on promoting progressive values squares those values with allowing an apologist for authoritarianism to own one of its teams. What’s more, why is a league run by a commissioner who rightly criticized President Trump’s Muslim travel ban for going “against the fundamental values and the fundamental ingredients of what makes for a great N.B.A.” also running a training camp for young players in the Chinese region of Xinjiang, amid camps of a far different kind?
Woke politics often seems to train our collective attention down on our navels rather than out at the world. Is the issue of gender-neutral bathrooms really as morally urgent as a country that is, as Pete Buttigieg sharply put it, “using technology for the perfection of dictatorship?” This is a worldview that encourages companies to take cost-free stands on the progressive cause of the moment and do absolutely nothing to uphold fundamental progressive values when doing so requires more sacrifice than the time it takes to write up a news release. A worldview that fails to force companies like the N.B.A., Apple, Google and Disney to account for the fact that they are serving as handmaidens to totalitarians is not one worth taking seriously.
The longstanding conventional wisdom on China — that engagement and investment by America in China would inevitably lead to the country’s political liberalization — has simply not proven true. This is the chestnut Adam Silver himself insists on, when he speaks about the possibilities of “basketball diplomacy.”
Alas, just the opposite has happened.
China has become more repressive the more it has engaged with the West. Meantime, that economic engagement has led major Western businesses and institutions to keep quiet on a major moral issue of this century. The N.B.A.-China partnership is just one example of so many in which Beijing is calling the shots.
Real political wisdom on this score lies with the creators of “South Park,” who, having offended China with an episode this week, dunked on the N.B.A.’s cravenness.
“Like the N.B.A., we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts,” said Trey Parker and Matt Stone in a statement. “We too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn’t just look like Winnie the Pooh at all. Tune into our 300th episode this Wednesday at 10! Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn’s sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now, China?”

"As Protesters Fill Hong Kong’s Streets, Businesses Are Alarmed, Too","HONG KONG — As tens of thousands of protesters returned to Hong Kong’s streets on Wednesday to speak out against a proposed law that would allow extraditions to mainland China, one prominent voice has been largely silent: big business.
But quietly, a wave of concern has spread through the community of foreign consultants, investors and executives who depend on Hong Kong as a safe base from which to do business in China.
No major company dares to speak out publicly for fear of angering the Chinese government. Behind the scenes, they are grappling with difficult questions about whether the legislation would endanger foreign executives or undermine the city’s legal system, a venue preferred over the mainland’s Communist Party-controlled courts for resolving disputes.
“The business and financial community is deeply concerned about what this may augur for Hong Kong,” said Fred Hu, founder of the investment firm Primavera Capital Group and former chairman of Goldman Sachs’s Greater China business.
“Any perceived erosion of independent judiciary and individual freedom could undermine investor confidence and negatively affect Hong Kong’s future as a leading global business and financial center,” Mr. Hu said.
The law could broadly threaten Hong Kong’s place as a middle ground between China and the business world. As the protests gathered steam in Hong Kong on Wednesday, Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the United States House of Representatives, issued a statement questioning whether Washington should reconsider a law that exempts Hong Kong from some of the trade and technology limits it imposes on the rest of China.
“Congress has no choice but to reassess whether Hong Kong is ‘sufficiently autonomous’ under ‘one country, two systems’ framework” if the government passes the bill, she said, referring to the arrangement that allows the Chinese city to function under its own laws.
Hong Kong’s stock market fell 1.7 percent on Wednesday in an otherwise quiet trading day in Asia, as protesters filled up a main transportation artery where multinational companies and international banks occupy much of the gleaming skyscraper real estate. The police used tear gas on protesters Wednesday afternoon on the same streets and sidewalks that bankers and lawyers for some of the world’s biggest companies travel on their daily commutes. Employees at major banks like HSBC and accounting firms like Deloitte were told to work from home in anticipation of grinding traffic and concerns about safety.
There were signs on Wednesday that tensions in Hong Kong were already undermining business confidence. A Hong Kong property developer called Goldin Financial Holdings cited “recent social contradiction and economic instability” for its decision this week to walk away from its $1.4 billion bid for a plot of land at the city’s former Kai Tak Airport. It did not detail its concerns.
For big business, Hong Kong was supposed to be safer than this.
When the British handed over Hong Kong, a former colony, to China in 1997 under the policy of “one country, two systems,” there was a promise that the territory would continue to operate under relative autonomy. Though Beijing effectively controls the system by which Hong Kong picks its top leaders, the city enjoys wide freedoms of speech and of the press. The government takes a light hand compared with the mainland when it comes to business regulation, and its courts are considered independent and well run.
For decades, major companies parked their Chinese or Asian headquarters in Hong Kong, making the city a major nexus of finance and commerce, though some of that power has ebbed as China grew wealthy in its own right and more companies began to deal with that market directly.
Still, unease has grown in recent months.
Last year, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong said that over half of its respondents were concerned about the rule of law. Business leaders cited a move by the Hong Kong government to reject a standard request by a journalist to renew his work visa last year as a major setback for Hong Kong’s independence. While the city government declined to disclose a reason, it appeared to be in response to the journalist hosting a talk with Andy Chan, the leader of a small political party that calls on Hong Kong to secede from China.
The trade war between the United States and China also threatens to make Hong Kong a bargaining chip. On Monday, a State Department spokeswoman said that “the continued erosion of the ‘one country, two systems’ framework puts at risk Hong Kong’s long-established special status in international affairs.”
Tara Joseph, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, said, “The extradition bill is worrying because for business it starts to call into question whether there is now a blurred line between politics and business in a city that views itself as a commercial capital that puts business first.”
Yet even as American companies, sometimes privately, have expressed increasing concern about the bill, it was too early to say whether they would pull out of Hong Kong and move operations elsewhere.
“People are talking about what this bill could mean and what their possible alternatives could be, but there are no immediate answers,” Ms. Joseph said.
One fear among businesses is that the United States could begin treating Hong Kong as if it were just another Chinese city. Under a 1992 law called the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act, the city enjoys special treatment for customs and commercial purposes. Changing or eliminating that law could crimp Hong Kong’s status as a business crossroads.
In recent days, as the front pages of American newspapers displayed images of the protests, lawmakers in Washington have taken greater interest in the territory both publicly and in private meetings, according to two people with direct knowledge of these meetings but not authorized to speak publicly.
Many have cited the most recent Hong Kong Policy Act Report by the State Department in March, which reported an increased “tempo of mainland central government intervention in Hong Kong affairs — and actions by the Hong Kong government consistent with mainland direction.” Despite this, the report concluded that Hong Kong continued to have a sufficient degree of autonomy.
Unlike big companies, many small businesses in Hong Kong have been outspoken against the legislation, worrying that it could permanently damage Hong Kong’s economy. More than a thousand of them closed on Wednesday in solidarity with the protesters. The city’s historically weak labor groups asked workers to call in sick.
On Instagram, hundreds of coffee shops, restaurants and other businesses posted pictures with the hashtag “#612strike.” One online floral company, Floraholic, wrote, “Hong Kong is sick, let’s take a day off for some rest!”
“Striking is the only action we could take,” said Yanki Lam, co-owner of Changchang Goodstore, a company in the city’s Kowloon district.
The Eaton Hong Kong, a hotel and co-working space, said it would allow its employees to attend the protests on Wednesday, saying that “we respect our team members’ political stances.”
Yet even with this growing sense of concern, foreign businesses that speak out could face retribution from the Chinese government.
“It’s almost impossible for foreign companies to do business in China without the approval of the mainland government,” said David Webb, a former banker and the publisher of the financial and corporate governance website Webb-site. “Quite rationally, they don’t want to stick their heads above the parapet.”
There is also a sense of resignation from big companies that rejecting the extradition legislation would do little to address a bigger problem of China’s growing reach into the city, Mr. Webb said.
“No amount of padding around the extradition treaty is going to fix that,” he said.

"From Chile to Lebanon, Protests Flare Over Wallet Issues","Pocketbook items have become the catalysts for popular fury across the globe in recent weeks.
LONDON — In Chile, the spark was an increase in subway fares. In Lebanon, it was a tax on WhatsApp calls. The government of Saudi Arabia moved against hookah pipes. In India, it was about onions.
Small pocketbook items became the focus of popular fury across the globe in recent weeks, as frustrated citizens filled the streets for unexpected protests that tapped into a wellspring of bubbling frustration at a class of political elites seen as irredeemably corrupt or hopelessly unjust or both. They followed mass demonstrations in Bolivia, Spain, Iraq and Russia and before that the Czech Republic, Algeria, Sudan and Kazakhstan in what has been a steady drumbeat of unrest over the past few months.
At first glance, many of the demonstrations were linked by little more than tactics. Weeks of unremitting civil disobedience in Hong Kong set the template for a confrontational approach driven by vastly different economic or political demands.
Yet in many of the restive countries, experts discern a pattern: a louder-than-usual howl against elites in countries where democracy is a source of disappointment, corruption is seen as brazen, and a tiny political class lives large while the younger generation struggles to get by.
“It’s young people who have had enough,” said Ali H. Soufan, chief executive of The Soufan Group, a security intelligence consultancy. “This new generation are not buying into what they see as the corrupt order of the political and economic elite in their own countries. They want a change.”
Few were as surprised as the leaders of those countries.
On Thursday, the President Sebastián Piñera of Chile boasted that his country was an oasis of stability in Latin America. “We are ready to do everything to not fall into populism, into demagoguery,” he said in an interview published in The Financial Times.
The next day, protesters attacked factories, torched subway stations and looted supermarkets in Chile’s worst upheaval in decades, eventually forcing Mr. Piñera to deploy troops to the streets. By Wednesday, at least 15 people were dead, and a clearly rattled Mr. Piñera had spoken of “war against a powerful and implacable enemy.”
In Lebanon, Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri survived recent embarrassing revelations about a $16 million gift to a bikini model whom he met at a luxury resort in the Seychelles in 2013, a move that, for some critics, epitomized Lebanon’s ruling class. Then last week he announced the tax on WhatsApp calls, setting off a revolt.
Decades of discontent over inequality, stagnation and corruption erupted into the open, drawing as much as a quarter of the country into euphoric antigovernment demonstrations driven by chants of “Revolution!”
With one of the highest levels of public debt and intractably low employment, Lebanon seems incapable of providing basic public services like electricity, clean drinking water or reliable internet service. Austerity measures have hollowed out the middle class, while the richest 0.1 percent of the population — which includes many politicians — earns a tenth of the country’s national income, much of it, critics say, from plundering the country’s resources.
On Monday Mr. Hariri scrapped the planned tax, announcing a hasty reform package to rescue the country’s sclerotic economy and pledging to recover public trust.
Although the recent scattering of mass protests appears dramatic, scholars say it is a continuation of a rising trend. For decades, societies across the world have become far likelier to pursue sweeping political change by taking to the streets.
The rate of protest has accelerated sharply of late, as various factors have converged: a slowing global economy, dizzying gaps between rich and poor and a youth bulge that in many countries has produced a restive new generation fizzing with frustrated ambition. In addition, the expansion of democracy has stalled globally, leaving citizens with unresponsive governments frustrated and activists sure that street action is the only way to force change.
But as protest movements grow, their success rates are plunging. Only 20 years ago, 70 percent of protests demanding systemic political change achieved it — a figure that had been growing steadily since the 1950s, according to a study by Erica Chenoweth, a Harvard University political scientist.
In the mid-2000s, that trend reversed. Success rates now stand at 30 percent, the study said, a decline that Professor Chenoweth called staggering.
These two trends are closely linked. As protests become more frequent but likelier to flounder, they stretch on and on, becoming more contentious, more visible — and more apt to return to the streets when their demands go unmet. The result may be a world where popular uprisings lose their prominence, becoming simply part of the landscape.
“Something has really shifted,” Professor Chenoweth said in an interview.
“You could say these protests mirror what’s going on in the United States,” said Vali Nasr, a Middle East scholar who recently stepped down as dean of Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. In countries where elections are decisive, like the United States and Britain, skepticism about the old political order has produced populist, nationalist and anti-immigrant results at the polls.
“In other countries, where people don’t have a voice, you have massive protests erupting,” he said.
The disparate outbreaks of unrest have not gone unnoticed at the United Nations. Secretary General António Guterres raised them at a meeting of the International Monetary Fund this past weekend, his spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, said on Tuesday. Critics have accused the I.M.F. of exacerbating economic hardships in countries like Ecuador through austerity measures imposed to reduce debts.
“We are seeing demonstrations in different places, but there are some commonalities,” Mr. Dujarric said, citing “people feeling they are under extreme financial pressure, the issue of inequality, and a lot of other structural issues.”
Some experts say the rash of global protests is too diverse to neatly categorize or ascribe to a single theme. Michael Ignatieff, president of Central European University, was in Barcelona last week as more than 500,000 people thronged the streets after a court sentenced former separatist leaders to prison.
While the Barcelona protests bore some resemblance to mass demonstrations in other cities, Mr. Ignatieff said it would be a mistake to lump them together. “People are not being swept away by the madness of the crowds,” he said. “This is politics, with specific causes and specific issues. If you don’t acknowledge that, you make popular politics look like a series of crazy fashions, like the same trousers or headgear.”
Still, within some regions, the protests are often similar to each other.
In the Middle East, the tumult has drawn inevitable comparisons with the upheavals of the Arab Spring of 2011. But experts say these recent protests are driven by a new generation that cares less about the old sectarian or ideological divides.
Instead of calling for the head of a dictator as many Arabs did in 2011, the Lebanese have indicted an entire political class.
“They are stealing and pretending that they aren’t. Who’s responsible, if not them?” Dany Yacoub, 22, said on Monday, the fourth day she had spent protesting in central Beirut. She studied to be a music teacher, but said she cannot find a job because it takes political connections to get hired in a school. “We don’t believe them anymore,” she said.
Many Arabs have been wary of popular protest since the Arab Spring uprisings, heeding doom-tinged warnings from authoritarian leaders that any upheaval could tip their societies into the same violent chaos as Libya, Syria or Yemen.
But the recent wave of protests in Lebanon, Egypt and Iraq — as well as revolts that toppled longstanding dictators in Algeria and Sudan this year — suggest that wall of fear is starting to crumble.
“Syria has been the boogeyman for a very long time,” said Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. “But Algeria and Sudan showed that chaos does not have to be the answer.”
Even in Saudi Arabia, where the threat of government repression makes public protests practically unthinkable, an unusual rebellion erupted on social media over a 100 percent tax on bills at restaurants with water pipes, or hookahs. The Arabic hashtag “tax on hookah restaurants” trended in the kingdom. Some Twitter commentators said the tax contradicted the ruling family’s desire to change Saudi Arabia’s ultraconservative image.
If protests are quicker to stir and more widespread than in earlier decades, they are also more fragile. The painstaking mobilization that once was a feature of grass-roots movements was slow but durable. Protests that organize on social media can rise faster, but collapse just as quickly.
Authoritarian governments have also learned to co-opt social media, using it to disseminate propaganda, rally sympathizers or simply spread confusion, Professor Chenoweth said.
And even where there is a spasm of protest, it takes a lot more for it to snowball into a full opposition movement. The soaring price of onions in India caused farmers to block highways and mount short-lived protests. But frustration has yet to sharpen into mass demonstrations because there is nobody to channel it: India’s opposition is in disarray; divisions of caste and religion dominate politics; and the government of the Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, constantly raises the threat of neighboring Pakistan to distract the public.

A French Wine From China? This $300 Bottle Is the Real Thing,"A Rothschild estate in Shandong Province has released its first vintage. It was 10 years in the making.
PENGLAI, China — In China, the stories about Château Lafite Rothschild are as notorious as the Bordeaux wine estate is legendary.
There are the tales — often repeated, never confirmed — of wealthy Chinese businessmen chugging Lafite mixed with Sprite. Or the time a Chinese official reportedly said at least half the Lafite sold in China was fake. More recent was a government crackdown on corruption that turned up huge stashes of the wine, worth tens of thousands of dollars, in the hands of local officials.
But the latest chapter in the saga of Lafite is something quite different: The company behind the famous name, Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite), is now the producer of a world-class wine made entirely in China.
Last month, Lafite released its first vintage from grapes grown at Domaine de Long Dai, its estate in Shandong Province. The centuries-old French winery is betting that it can ride out China’s economic slowdown and turn nationalistic headwinds to its advantage with a locally made product.
Wine has been made from grapes in China for centuries, but it was never as popular as other drinks and the country has not been known for its winemaking. It wasn’t until recently that the country’s producers began to aim for a higher quality that might appeal to oenophiles, mostly on a small scale.
“When I was starting to visit, a lot of the high-end collectors were saying, ‘We’re never going to drink Chinese wine,’” said Saskia de Rothschild, who succeeded her father to become chairwoman of Lafite last year. “That’s really the bet that we are taking: to make a high-end Chinese wine for the Chinese to be proud of.”
Still, Lafite’s winemakers have been at work during a difficult time for companies catering to China’s elite.
President Xi Jinping’s campaign against corruption dampened extravagant spending for years, with sales of wine — a favorite gift among the nation’s political and business leaders — hit particularly hard. Last year, China’s wine imports by volume declined for the first time in five years, according to a report by Wine Intelligence, a research firm in London.
For foreign businesses, a second challenge has been rising nationalist sentiment among Chinese consumers. The National Basketball Association recently found itself at the center of a firestorm after the general manager of the Houston Rockets posted support on Twitter for the Hong Kong protests, which the Chinese widely see as a separatist movement.Coach, Givenchy and Versace each apologized after drawing fierce criticism for T-shirts that were seen as having undermined China’s sovereignty by identifying the semiautonomous regions of Hong Kong and Macau as separate countries.
But Lafite is seeking to tap into that patriotic sentiment by offering a wine made in China by a mostly Chinese team.
“Throughout the years, we have seen the Chinese consumer change, and ‘Made in China’ has actually become something that people are proud of,” said Ms. Rothschild, a former journalist who has written for The New York Times.
Ms. Rothschild spoke at the new estate, which is nestled among vineyards and apple orchards in Shandong, a coastal province. On a visit in mid-September ahead of the official launch, bright red signs extolling the Chinese Communist Party dotted the drive through terraced vineyards up to the estate.
The 2017 vintage from Domaine de Long Dai is a blend of cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and marselan grapes. Marselan is a cross between cabernet sauvignon and grenache that is popular among Chinese wine drinkers.
In a July review of the first vintage, Jancis Robinson, a British wine writer, called it a “very good debut effort indeed.”
“As for the wine, it is suitably Lafite-like,” she wrote on her website, adding that it was “as bone dry as the Bordeaux first growth, utterly correct if not absolutely stunning.”
With 74 acres of vineyards, production at the new estate is modest. Only 2,500 cases of the 2017 vintage will be sold, mostly in China, compared with the 16,000 that Château Lafite Rothschild in Bordeaux produces on average.
Each bottle is equipped with a special chip technology to guard against counterfeiting, which has been a major problem for Lafite in China over the years.
Bottles of the 2017 Long Dai are priced at 2,388 renminbi, or about $335. That is comparable to a bottle of high-end baijiu, a grain liquor known as China’s national drink, though far less than some older vintages of Château Lafite Rothschild, which can sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
On a recent blue-skied afternoon in Mulangou, a village just steps away from Long Dai, residents heaped praise on the Lafite estate for bringing jobs and distributing gifts during the holidays.
But when asked if he would be drinking the Long Dai wine, Huang Chuanjun, 70, a regular beer drinker, shook his head.
“It’s more expensive than gold!” said Mr. Huang, who was carrying a jug of soy sauce. “I wouldn’t even spend 100 renminbi on it. I can’t tell the difference anyway.”
The 2017 wine is the culmination of a project that began 10 years ago, when the Lafite brand was at the peak of its popularity in China. “Lafite” has been used in the names of Chinese apartment complexes and even barbecue restaurants, said Jim Boyce, founder of Grape Wall of China, an English-language blog about Chinese wine.
“It’s attached to the idea of the quality of a lifestyle,” Mr. Boyce said.
But a number of high-end Chinese wines have emerged in the last decade, including Legacy Peak in Ningxia and Ao Yun, made from grapes grown in the Tibetan foothills and owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest luxury group.
“The timing feels weird to me,” Mr. Boyce said of the Long Dai launch. “It feels like part of a trend that’s already had its moment.”
For Lafite, though, the estate in Shandong also offers a foothold into China’s growing market for pricey wines. It features a visitor center and a so-called classroom for wine education, a first for a Lafite estate and a way to promote sales of the company’s other wines and overcome competition from Chinese competitors.
References to the Rothschild family, which has owned Lafite for more than 150 years, appear throughout. A video of Ms. Rothschild in conversation with her father, Baron Éric de Rothschild, plays in the visitor center. Paintings by her mother, the artist Maria-Beatrice Caracciolo Di Forino, and copies of oil portraits of 19th-century Rothschilds adorn the walls of the buildings.
The company chose Shandong for its temperate winters and proximity to transportation hubs, bucking a trend among other wine producers that gravitated toward China’s western regions.
But the site came with challenges. The winemakers have had to find a balance between the heavy monsoon rains in the summer and the dry spring seasons. There have also been recurring thefts of grapes by locals. Now, five guards watch over the vineyards at night.
And, as is often the case for foreign companies in China, managing relations with the government was tricky at times. Patience and precision, both crucial in making great wine, can be anathema to local officials who often have short-term growth targets.
In Penglai, hopes are high that the winery will spur the development of a tourism area similar to Napa Valley in California. Already, a medley of projects, including a Roman Colosseum look-alike, a development called Napa Village and a French-inspired chateau have sprung up in the area surrounding Domaine de Long Dai.
“We had a lot of pressure from local officials to open,” said Olivier Trégoat, technical director of Lafite’s properties outside Bordeaux. “I would definitely have waited.”

The Extraordinary Power of Hong Kongers’ Solidarity,"HONG KONG — The battle between the government and this city’s protest movement couldn’t have been on starker display last Monday, July 1 — a day that began with a closed-door official ceremony celebrating Hong Kong’s return to China in 1997 and ended with an hourslong break-in at the Legislative Council.
The siege of LegCo was the most dramatic move yet by protesters who for weeks have waged various actions to oppose a proposed law allowing extradition to mainland China — a law, they say, that would become a certain tool of political persecution. The occupation ended late that night not, as feared, with a violent showdown with the police, but with a remarkable rescue mission by the protesters themselves.
The police had warned that it would clear the building at midnight, and as the hour approached, a heated discussion about whether to stay or go broke out among a handful of protesters in the council’s voting chamber.
At the doorway were two protesters wearing masks. One told me, his voice cracking, that he wanted to leave but would stay to protect the stalwarts.
A few moments later, outside the building, scores of protesters took a loose vote on what to do. “We leave together! We leave together!” A group rushed back inside to retrieve the few still in the chamber and dragged them away.
The police and the tear gas got to the building just after everyone had cleared out.
It is the footage of that rescue mission and those last moments in the council chamber — not the photos of shattered glass and graffiti — that best capture what the events of that day, and the protest movement itself, really stand for.
The break-in into LegCo was not, as has been widely described, an “unprecedented scene of chaos” or an occasion of “wanton vandalism” — or even violent. Nor is the event significant for exposing divisions over tactics that threaten to tear the pro-democracy camp apart.
Of course, there are differences among the many people who have rallied against the extradition bill and the Hong Kong government: How could there not be when the opposition has grown so big, the issues it is taking on seem intractable and the stakes are so high? That there are differences between protesters isn’t notable; what’s notable is the protesters’ will to stick together despite those differences.
Also notable about the LegCo break-in was the police’s absence from the scene. This was a relief, given the violence of its crackdown on a protest on June 12. But it is ominous as well. What kind of police force doesn’t act to prevent the legislature from being stormed? A police force that no longer sees its purpose as maintaining public order and is, instead, carrying out the government’s political agenda.
The Hong Kong police should have intervened to prevent the break-in into LegCo, and it could have. It didn’t stop the protesters because the government didn’t want it to.
At midday, amid several hundred protesters, a dozen or so people started going at a members’ entrance of LegCo on the street. They had no tools, and seemed unprepared. Apparently, no one had Googled how to break through reinforced, laminated glass and they went after the very thick window panes — instead of doors, frames or hinges — and pounded them with makeshift battering rams, including a metal cart on wheels that would bang and bounce back. Some police officers were standing inside holding a red warning flag, occasionally pepper-spraying through cracks in the glass.
After a long while of watching the scene, I wondered if the protesters really wanted to get in. Two or three hours later — I lost track — they had broken through a couple of panels. But then, that was that; the action stopped. “Tea time,” a few of us onlookers joked.
Come late afternoon, as some people were arriving from the annual anti-handover march nearby, another attempt to get into LegCo was underway, this time at the main public entrance. Walking around the building, I had just caught sight of some police officers relaxing inside, on the other side of the entrance.
This second effort to break in was more spirited than the first, but still plodding and amateurish. It took several hours of banging and pounding to break through a few doors and windows and hoist up a metal curtain. In the meantime, among both chants of encouragement and wary milling about, I asked protesters standing by if they intended to go inside. They weren’t sure. The feeling among them was general support, but also hesitation and confusion — and fear that police officers were lying in wait.
The police could easily have intervened then, and without much risk of a clash. Darkness had fallen, and simply turning off all street and building lights and activating the fire sprinklers overhead probably would have sent many people away.
Many of the protesters I watched go inside only did so after some hesitation. Once in the main entrance hall, they seemed uncertain, almost dazed. Their white and yellow construction helmets were going up escalators, and coming down escalators. Where were they heading? To the council chamber, several said, stopping to study a visitors’ map on the wall.
I wouldn’t describe the scene inside as “mayhem.” I saw jammed elevators and broken display cases, as well as signs and notesto preserve books and not damage knickknacks.Some graffiti were curses, and plenty said “dogs” — a leitmotif of anti-police sentiment. But many more of the tags were pointed political slogans, like “Hong Kong is not China.” “No more functional constituencies” was spray-painted across legislators’ desks in the main chamber, a reference to LegCo seats that are elected by special-interest groups rather than the general public. Geeky, those hooligans.
Still, Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung, a legislator, was worried about the optics. “It was a trap,” he said, looking around the chamber, and the protesters had walked right into it. He also said that throughout the day the office of Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, had “blankly refused” repeated requests from legislators to meet to find a way to defuse the situation.
When the police finally did come, just past midnight, their clearance operation seemed close to exemplary. They had set a deadline and announced it on social media, giving protesters ample warning. They marched up the streets toward LegCo decisively and left obvious escape routes. They used tear gas, but only minimally. They would advance quickly and loudly and then stop, allowing protesters to keep their distance. Within less than an hour, almost all protesters had vanished into side streets — some darting into the subway station to catch the last train home.
The officers’ restraint that night was a relief, yet the broader implications of it are sinister: If the police knew precisely how to handle that situation, then their abuses of June 12 were not a slip-up but deliberate. They can’t possibly have learned to do their job properly in just those few intervening weeks; what they learned from June 12 was that they didn’t want more public outcry over another display of police brutality.
And yes, perhaps the protesters’ case would now be simpler and tidier — more morally photogenic — if once inside LegCo they had touched nothing and staged a massive sit-in, arms locked, or something reassuringly Gandhian and abstemious like that. But considering the circumstances, it seems oddly squeamish and rather perverse to be scandalized by broken glass and tagged walls. Far more troubling than anything the protesters did last Monday is what the police didn’t do — and what the government hasn’t done.
And to excuse the break-in as an act of brash folly by desperate youth seems like misguided bien-pensant paternalism. This, too, is falling into a trap.
However muddled some of the protesters’ methods may seem, their underlying purpose and principles couldn’t be clearer. There is no arguing about the heart, the spirit and the extraordinary decency of the small group who went back into LegCo to drag out the few who remained or the many more who stayed outside the building to act as a buffer against the police.
Something similar goes for that large segment of the broader public that has mobilized against the extradition bill, the Lam administration and creeping encroachment by the Chinese government. My sense, based on conversations, anecdotal evidence and intuition, is that solidarity prevails within this movement despite any disagreements, however deep, over tactics.
Even people who frown on the siege of LegCo aren’t suddenly going to support extradition to mainland China or start trusting the Hong Kong government. And plenty seem to respect the courage of those they think were foolhardy to break in. Some say they cried watching footage of the last-ditch rescue party, with its interview of a young woman who describes, sobbing, how scared she is that the police will arrive — and how much more scared still she would be for anyone left behind.
Since the early days of the 2014 Umbrella Movement I haven’t known how to think about, much less describe, the force that drives the surges of contestation in Hong Kong. Protesters today are demanding, among other things, that Ms. Lam resign. But they know that she is unlikely to and that if she does, it won’t change anything. That’s too lucid a position to be called naïveté, and too defiant to be called defeatism.
Whatever this combination is, though, it can be as powerful as it is mind-bending and moving. The extradition bill was suspended, after all, in the face of mass marches. True, it wasn’t withdrawn, and there is a difference between those two things. But there is an even bigger difference between the bill’s being suspended and its having passed.
The stakes and the dangers feel far greater today than they did in 2014; self-sacrifice is in the air. One of the last protesters in the council chamber, a young father, told a reporter he would stay until the end; his own father had escaped China, wounded, during the Cultural Revolution, he explained, and now he was defending Hong Kong for his children. Another took off his mask before declaring the movement’s core demands.
Protesters like them, who are willing to risk their education, career or a family life to face lengthy prison terms, are being called 義士, roughly, “justice warriors.” On Wednesday, a fourth person committed suicide, partly, it is thought, because of despair over this political crisis and Hong Kong’s prospects. “Martyrs” is some protesters’ word for those dead.
Last Monday evening, as I was watching the slow-motion break-in at LegCo’s public entrance, a protester who had just mocked the effort as ham-handed, said, “Is it too grand, ridiculous, to say that Hong Kong is at the forefront of the fight for freedom?” It does sound grand, but where else are so many people, unarmed, so brazenly resisting the Chinese government’s authoritarianism? The garrisons of the People’s Liberation Army are a block away from LegCo.

Putin’s Nightmare: The Ballot Box,"On the eve of regional elections, the Kremlin has turned to tricks, threats and shows of force to get past the shadows of protests and falling approval ratings for Russia’s president.
On Sept. 8, Russians will vote in municipal and regional elections, and the authorities are afraid. Not of any foreign power’s interference in Russia’s elections — there have been no fair elections in decades — but of Russia’s own people and opposition candidates, who are far more popular than the official nominees.
Moscow’s old bag of electoral tricks survives — for example, moving elections from December to early September so that summer vacations would leave challengers little time to organize. The authorities have resorted to new tricks too, like clogging the electoral system with fake candidates and putting party loyalists on the ballot as independent candidates.
This year’s election will also see a new mobile digital voting system that allows people to vote online from any location. Critics say it is yet another trick to help the authorities.
Leaving nothing to chance, Moscow’s electoral commission found bogus reasons to disqualify all unapproved candidates from running in the elections. And to intimidate those would-be candidates, their homes were raided and many of them were detained, brought to Police Headquarters and interrogated in the middle of the night.
Yet none of that worked: Thousands of people took to the streets, beginning on July 28, to protest the election committee’s decisions. In response, the authorities deployed an overwhelming force of local and federal police who detained most opposition leaders and nearly 1,400 demonstrators.
Two weeks later, when Moscow’s authorities permitted an organized meeting, some 60,000 people gathered in the streets despite government warnings and intimidation. Even though the meeting was officially sanctioned, the police used force to disperse the demonstrators and arrested hundreds. Since then, all opposition requests to allow meetings have been rejected.
The Kremlin has been sending a clear message: There will be no Hong Kong here, with its huge protests, nor any Istanbul, with its fair election that led to the opposition’s victory. And to achieve this, the Kremlin is determined to use violence on a large scale. It should surprise nobody. This is the natural evolution of an autocracy — when its public slowly turns against the regime, brute force remains the only means to stay in power.
By any measure, the decline of Putinism is indisputable. It was best captured by a poll conducted in May by the government-run Public Opinion Center, which showed that public trust in President Vladimir Putin had fallen to 25 percent. The Kremlin, which uses the center to gauge public opinion and rarely makes the results public, was furious and called for another poll. Several days later, a new poll showed that 72 percent of Russians had trust in the president. The Kremlin was happy, and the center promised “to improve its methodology.”
Then in June, after Mr. Putin’s annual Direct Line TV appearance — a question-and-answer marathon staged to present an all-knowing leader in direct communication with citizens — the channel’s YouTube site registered 12,000 likes and 170,000 dislikes. Some experts calculated Mr. Putin’s support among this audience at about 7 percent.
With the examples of Hong Kong and Istanbul perhaps on their minds, Mr. Putin and his cronies surely remember how, 30 years ago, Mikhail Gorbachev experimented with a limited free election. Previous Soviet national and regional elections had been shams, with Communist Party candidates invariably winning their posts because they faced no competitors.
Mr. Gorbachev wanted to invigorate the Soviet system by making it more competitive and allowing some nonparty members into its legislative body.
To do so, he created a new legislative body: the Congress of People’s Deputies, consisting of 2,250 delegates. One-third of the seats were reserved for Communist Party members, leaving the other two-thirds open to contest. Of course, even in the openly elected seats, the party-endorsed candidates had numerous advantages. And yet, when the election took place in March 1989, there were big surprises: 300 candidates, or about 16 percent of the new legislative body, had defeated party-endorsed candidates. Among those who lost were five Central Committee members, one member of the Politburo, and 35 regional party bosses.
Mr. Gorbachev touted the new election as a victory for his reforms and a successful effort to democratize the Soviet political system. The hard-liners, unnerved by new freedoms and unaccustomed to any political opposition, were not amused then, as they are not amused now.
One longtime Kremlin insider and an architect of Mr. Putin’s regime, Vladislav Surkov, recently declared that Russia could be maintained only as a military-police state, and that Mr. Putin was the only leader whom the Russian people could trust. Putinism, he maintained, was a new political system, and like Marxism or Leninism, would last for centuries.
Despite such wishful thinking — or posturing — at the top, Putinism has been steadily falling apart: Government-controlled media are struggling to sustain the president’s falling ratings; Russia’s regions are impoverished; the oil- and gas-dependent economy is anemic; Russia’s elites are consumed by infighting for pieces of a shrinking pie; and the young generation is less susceptible than their forebears to government propaganda.
Putinism appears destined to last a far shorter time than either Marxism or Leninism. It was conceived as a hybrid autocracy in which a ruling elite controls most of the economy and media in the name of the state, but tolerates a limited number of independent but closely watched businesses and media outlets. Unlike the Chinese Communist Party, with its total control of society, Mr. Putin’s Kremlin has chosen to leave an escape valve for dissenting opinions — as long as they remain marginal and pose no threat to those in power.
But this model may have now reached its end. The opposition proved to be less marginal than the Kremlin hoped and, as dissatisfaction with the regime grew, the Kremlin decided there was no longer any usefulness in pretending that democracy ruled. The irony is that despite Moscow’s new willingness to move toward a stricter Chinese mode, it is the seriousness with which Russians took those previous grants of limited liberties that now make harsh repression necessary.
In truth, Russia has already reverted to a military-police state, keeping Mr. Putin and his regime in power mainly by force and intimidation. Not relying on police alone, the Kremlin in 2016 created a special force of 340,000 strong Russian Guards, whose mission is primarily “protecting public order.” The government has also been steadily dismantling what is left of a market economy, moving assets into the state coffers and investing in a rapidly expanding military-industrial complex.
Most of the recent mass arrests, and the brutal treatment of protesters and members of the opposition, are a clear indication that the regime is fully prepared to use violence to stay in power.
The Kremlin understands that genuine democracy would mean the end of Putinism, and so it leaves those who desire change through democratic means with no options. But does Mr. Putin really want to turn Red Square into a Russian Tiananmen Square?

"When It Comes to China, Silence Is Golden","The N.B.A., like other American businesses, has shown that it’s willing to play by China’s rules in exchange for China’s money.
“Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.”
Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted that message on Friday. It’s a sentiment that should command broad support in the United States, and throughout the free world.
But the reaction from China, which does not number free expression among its cherished values, was swift and painful for the N.B.A. The shoe company Li Ning and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank ended sponsorship deals with the Rockets; Chinese broadcasters said they would not show Rockets games; the Chinese Basketball Association — led by the former Rockets star Yao Ming — suspended ties with the team.
“There is no doubt, the economic impact is already clear,” said Adam Silver, the league’s commissioner.
Mr. Silver went on to add that he supported Mr. Morey, but “what I am supporting is his freedom of political expression in this situation.”
The billionaires who control the lucrative basketball league, however, nearly tripped over themselves in their haste to abjure Mr. Morey’s remarks. The N.B.A., like many large American businesses, is besotted by the opportunity to make money in China’s expanding market. And the league once again made clear it is willing to obey China’s rules to preserve that chance.
The owner of the Rockets, Tilman Fertitta, raced for the traditional refuge of international capitalists — the insistence that business can be segregated from political considerations. “We’re here to play basketball and not to offend anybody,” Mr. Fertitta told ESPN.
But it should be perfectly clear that playing basketball in China is political.
Last year, the N.B.A. staged a game in South Africa for the explicit purpose of celebrating the life of Nelson Mandela. When the N.B.A. goes to China, that’s a statement, too.
It means that the N.B.A. has weighed China’s human rights abuses against China’s potential as a source of revenue, and it has decided that it can live with state policies like the detention of hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims in the northwestern province of Xinjiang.
The owner of the Brooklyn Nets, the Chinese billionaire Joe Tsai, took the opportunity to publish an open letter scolding Americans for talking about the affairs of other nations. He also mischaracterized the Hong Kong protests as a “separatist movement.”
Mr. Tsai’s suggestion that people should avoid “third rail” issues may well be good manners when visiting a foreign country, but Mr. Morey posted his tweet while visiting Japan — and on a website that is not accessible to the general public in mainland China.
The face of the Rockets, the point guard James Harden, issued a public apology on Monday.
“We apologize,” he said.
For what, exactly, remained unclear.
Do the N.B.A.’s owners appreciate that their wealth is a product of the freedoms they enjoy in this country? Does Mr. Harden, the owner of a famous beard, know that Muslims in Xinjiang are not allowed to grow beards like his?
The N.B.A. has an undoubted right to set rules for its work force, but it cannot simultaneously claim to champion free expression — the value of which consists entirely in the right to say what others don’t want to hear.
American executives and policymakers initially reconciled themselves to following China’s rules by arguing that China’s turn toward capitalism, and its exposure to the United States, would gradually lead toward democracy and a greater respect for human rights. They argued, in effect, that silence was the most productive form of criticism.
It should now be clear that silence is merely complicity, no more or less.
It is the moral price the N.B.A. and other businesses are paying for making money in China.

China Is Waging a Disinformation War Against Hong Kong Protesters,"BEIJING — When a projectile struck a Hong Kong woman in the eye this week as protesters clashed with the police, China responded quickly: Its state television network reported that the woman had been injured not by one of the police’s bean bag rounds, but by a protester.
The network’s website went further: It posted what it said was a photo of the woman counting out cash on a Hong Kong sidewalk — insinuating, as Chinese reports have claimed before, that the protesters are merely paid provocateurs.
The assertion was more than just spin or fake news. The Communist Party exerts overwhelming control over media content inside China’s so-called Great Firewall, and it is now using it as a cudgel in an information war over the protests that have convulsed Hong Kong for months.
In recent days, China has more aggressively stirred up nationalist and anti-Western sentiment using state and social media, and it has manipulated the context of images and videos to undermine the protesters. Chinese officials have begun branding the demonstrations as a prelude to terrorism.
The result, both in mainland China and abroad, has been to create an alternate version of what, seen from Hong Kong, is clearly a popular demonstration movement. In China’s version, a small, violent gang of protesters, unsupported by residents and provoked by foreign agents, is running rampant, calling for Hong Kong’s independence and tearing China apart.
This narrative almost certainly reflects that of the country’s leaders, including Xi Jinping, and it is fueling misunderstanding — and, increasingly, anger — among the Chinese public. That could, in turn, raise pressure on the government, increasing the risk of an overreaction or miscalculation based on limited or inaccurate information.
People posting on Weibo, a Chinese social media service similar to Twitter, are increasingly calling for Beijing to act. “Beating them to a pulp is not enough,” one person said about protesters on Tuesday, echoing an increasingly common sentiment on Weibo. “They must be beaten to death. Just send a few tanks over to clean them up.”
Since China’s censors have the ability to quickly remove offending comments, the abundance of them suggests that the government is willing to tolerate the warning they deliver, however ominous it sounds.
China has long curated the content that it allows its citizens to see and read. Its new campaign has echoes of tactics used by other countries, principally Russia, to inundate domestic and international audiences with bursts of information, propaganda and, in some cases, outright disinformation.
“Propagandists observe each other across borders, and they learn from each other,” said Peter Pomerantsev, the author of “This is Not Propaganda,” a new book that describes how authoritarian governments have weaponized social media that were once hailed as harbingers for democratic ideals.
The disinformation has clearly been aimed at undermining sympathy for the Hong Kong protesters’ goals, which now include demands for greater democratic freedoms for the territory’s seven million residents.
Propaganda in the traditional sense, Mr. Pomerantsev said, would try to win over an audience, while disinformation is meant simply to sow confusion and fuel conspiracies.
“You have to smother everything with doubt, and conspiracy is very effective in creating that,” Mr. Pomerantsev said in a telephone interview.
Though China’s disinformation network has received less global attention than Russia’s, the country’s officials have, over the last decade, built a machinery of online controls that far exceed any other country’s.
Many overseas websites are blocked in China. Censors embedded within its internet companies delete anything unacceptable. The police have arrested people who speak out of turn in chat groups, or who share sensitive content online.
The state media — whose history of propagandizing stretches back to Mao Zedong’s era — have also made powerful inroads in the new media online, filling the mainland’s information vacuum with an officially Sinicized worldview.
Hong Kong, which Britain returned to Chinese rule in 1997, remains outside China’s firewall, and thus is sitting along one of the world’s most profound online divides. Preserving the city’s freedom to live without the mainland’s controls has become one of the causes now motivating the protests.
“Deep inside, mainlanders and Hong Kong people have very different life experiences and emotions,” said Fang Kecheng, an assistant professor of journalism at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “Without the shared emotions, it’s not easy for mainlanders — even those who can freely access information — to empathize with Hong Kong people, which is an important explanation for how the government has been able to create a parallel universe of narratives.”
China’s new aggressiveness in the effort represents a shift in tactics. When large protests erupted in June over the Hong Kong government’s proposed law allowing the extradition of criminal suspects to the mainland, China’s state media — and officials — largely ignored them.
That changed on July 1, when protesters stormed Hong Kong’s Legislative Council building after a day of peaceful demonstrations. A flurry of articles and editorials in China’s state media followed, condemning the vandalism and violence — without explaining what the protesters were protesting about.
Since then, the state media have vigorously defended the police in Hong Kong, belittled the protesters and accused Westerners of orchestrating the turmoil. Efforts to contextualize the situation or express sympathy for the protesters were swiftly purged from social media.
The propaganda campaign intensified after July 21, when protesters surrounded the Chinese government’s main office in Hong Kong and threw black ink on a government emblem. And when a Chinese flag was thrown into Victoria Harbor on Aug. 3, the reaction in China — at least online, stoked by state media — reached a fevered pitch.
“The five-star flag has 1.4 billion guardians,” CCTV wrote indignantly to its 87 million followers on Weibo. “Repost! ‘I am a guardian of the flag!’ ”
It was reposted by more than 10 million people, including Jackie Chan, the Hong Kong martial arts film star. On Twitter, which is banned in China, the People’s Daily later reposted CCTV’s original post, giving it an international audience.
Just across the border from Hong Kong, in the city of Shenzhen, the Chinese security forces have conducted large-scale operations in recent days, in a nationalistic display that got prominent coverage in the state media.
Other media reports have been outright deceptive. A video appeared on Monday showing a protester with a toy weapon used in Airsoft — a Paintball-like game that is popular in Hong Kong. The China Daily, a newspaper of the Communist Party, circulated it widely as evidence that the protesters had taken up arms, identifying the toy as an M320 grenade launcher used by the United States Army.
“What is the difference between this and the terrorists!” read one reply. “How long must we tolerate this?”
“What Is America Up To?” has become a hashtag promoted by CCTV on social media, according to Manya Koetse, the editor of What’s On Weibo, a site that monitors trends on the platform. Other posts celebrate the Hong Kong police as embattled heroes, while Hong Kong residents are regularly portrayed as spoiled.
The yawning power imbalance, from an information-warfare point of view, has frustrated many protesters as they try to outline their demands and clarify what has actually happened in the streets.
During a peaceful sit-in at Hong Kong’s airport late last month, protesters sought to explain their demands to arriving passengers, including travelers from the mainland. But the Chinese media promoted a video of a few protesters harassing a white-haired traveler who had ripped a poster out of a demonstrator’s hands.
“Witness said the old man refused to take leaflet demonstrators gave out. I think old people don’t deserve this no matter what is the reason,” the editor of The Global Times, Hu Xijin, wrote on Twitter, with a video that only showed protesters confronting the man.
“These young people have lost all compassion for political frenzy,” he added.

"Hong Kong, Carrie Lam Didn’t Do It for You","The city’s leader finally makes a concession — caving to Beijing and big business.
At long last, on Wednesday Carrie Lam, the leader of Hong Kong, announced, along with a few other largely symbolic measures, the formal withdrawal of the contentious extradition bill that set off a summer of protests. But this is a totally unacceptable response to the crisis facing the city. And no less than her earlier steadfast refusal to concede anything to the protesters, the gesture — so minor and coming so late — only confirms what many of us suspected are the interests she really serves.
Far more revealing than what she just announced publicly are statements she recently made in private. Last week, in the midst of intensifying police brutality against the protesters, Mrs. Lam met with a privileged group of businesspeople and told them, off the record, that she would quit “if I have a choice.” Her talk was recorded on the sly, leaked and disclosed on Monday. On Tuesday, she told journalists that she had never tendered her resignation to Beijing and had not considered doing so.
Maybe she thought she was showing a softer side at that private meeting last week — her human face, if you will — but the performance was shabby, a mixed bag of practiced remorse and the callousness typical of the ruling class. And more.
Now was no time for self-pity, she said, and yet she went on to lament, choking up at times, that she no longer dared to go out for shopping or to get her hair done, for fear of being met by throngs of young people in black T-shirts and black masks (black is the protesters’ preferred color). All this she said even as hundreds of police officers in full riot gear have been let loose these days, bashing the skulls and breaking the teeth of protesters and innocent bystanders alike, pulling off the underwear of a young woman they arrested and deliberately crushing hands under their boots. The chief executive can’t visit her coiffeur? Big deal.
Mrs. Lam is heard saying in the recording, “for a chief executive to have caused this huge havoc to Hong Kong is unforgivable.” Quite so. Especially since “havoc” is a gross euphemism for what Mrs. Lam has done. She has undermined constitutional guarantees and political freedoms. She has politicized what was once a professional police force and turned it into a tool of oppression that acts at the behest of Beijing. She has given the police unheard-of license to make arrests in hospitals and bully patients, and to mistreat — my euphemism this time — protesters and reporters at the front lines. The special governance system that Beijing had promised would govern Hong Kong and keep it distinct from the mainland until at least 2047 has been thoroughly trampled.
Yet it is to a small group of businesspeople — and presumably a very select bunch of those — that Mrs. Lam made “a plea to you for your forgiveness.” But forgiveness for what, from them? For allowing the protesters to close down the airport for a couple of days? For sending a little tremor through the real estate market, still sky-high, which has made developers so very rich for so very long? For knocking some 5,000 points off the Hang Seng Index since May? For hurting the city’s big corporate families?
Mrs. Lam has yet to properly ask for the forgiveness of Hong Kongers. (In June, she said, “I offer my most sincere apology to all people of Hong Kong,” but then flatly refused to do anything they asked.) In her talk to the business group, she recited almost verbatim from the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-Constitution, that in her capacity as chief executive she is required to serve two masters: the central government in Beijing and the people of Hong Kong. In fact, she seems to be serving only Beijing and a small business elite in Hong Kong.
Only, other swaths of the business sector have had little patience for Mrs. Lam’s intransigence. The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce pointedly asked her to make serious concessions toward the protesters in late July.
And so finally on Wednesday, Mrs. Lam announced the formal withdrawal of a bill that would allow the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China, one of five of the protesters’ demands. This is ridiculous on her part, after holding out all summer as she has while protesters have been tear-gassed, maimed and subjected to cruel treatment by the police — and while much of the city’s population has supported them, turning up for marches in the hundreds of thousands. At this stage, nothing short of the government’s addressing the protesters’ fifth, and most sweeping, demand — real universal suffrage for both executive and legislative elections — can be enough. Some protesters have already declared on the online forum LIHKG, “Five Demands. Not One Less.”
Whatever the protesters’ next response to Wednesday’s announcements, and however the government then follows up, Mrs. Lam’s off-the-record talk with the business group last week holds hints of what may come in the medium term.
She said that she had gotten clear hints from Beijing that no matter what happened in the streets of Hong Kong, China would not send in the People’s Liberation Army; Beijing just wouldn’t risk damaging its “international profile,” which took so long to build, as “not only a big economy, but a big, responsible economy.” There is unintended mercy in cold calculus, apparently.
But this also means, in the words of Mrs. Lam, that the authorities in Beijing are “willing to play it long,” and “so you have no short-term solution.” Put another way: China’s strategy is essentially to play a game of attrition, conceding as little as possible while expecting the Hong Kong government and the local police to hold out longer than the protesters, despite the risk of imposing significant costs on the city in the meantime.
“You lose tourism, economy, you lose your IPOs and so on, but you can’t do much about it,” Mrs. Lam is heard warning the business group. Then she tries to sound reassuring: “But after everything has been settled, the country will be there to help, with maybe positive measures, especially in the Greater Bay Area.”
Yet will businesspeople just sit still and wait, especially in a financial center like Hong Kong, where being nimble and making quick money are the highest business virtues? And the opposition movement is not stupid: It is trying to prolong the conflict, hoping to sap the economy enough that the business sector will start clamoring for a comprehensive political solution.
On Tuesday, a nameless pro-independence group claiming to be active on the front lines of the protests — and responsible for knifing an off-duty policeman this weekend — issued a manifesto. (Here is the original in Cantonese; here is an adequate summary in English.) The document criticizes the so-called courageous-militant arm of the resistance movement as being too costly in human terms: Close to 1,000 protesters have already been arrested. But it also argues that so-called peaceful-rational camp within the movement is too costly in financial terms: Millions of dollars have been spent on political advertisements in Western media. And so this nameless group proposes a more sustainable strategy: a low-cost and high-risk effort that would pinpoint its use of violence, targeting individual police officers. That, it argues, could quickly demoralize the entire force, especially since many officers joined the force for job security and good pay.
First reactions to the manifesto online were conflicted, even among protesters. Would such as extreme approach be tolerated, if only tacitly, by the mainstream resistance?
Just maybe, especially considering that the courageous-militant response to mounting police brutality, which was unimaginable just three months ago, is now accepted, even celebrated at times. Beijing isn’t the only one playing a game of attrition in Hong Kong.

Evo Morales Is Gone. Bolivia’s Problems Aren’t.,"The country’s growing economy and shrinking inequality propped him up for years. But its democracy and its institutions suffered, and that’s what brought him down.
The forced ouster of an elected leader is by definition a setback to democracy, and so a moment of risk. But when a leader resorts to brazenly abusing the power and institutions put in his care by the electorate, as President Evo Morales did in Bolivia, it is he who sheds his legitimacy, and forcing him out often becomes the only remaining option. That is what the Bolivians have done, and what remains is to hope that Mr. Morales goes peacefully into exile in Mexico and to help Bolivia restore its wounded democracy.
That is not to say the fall of Mr. Morales is a cause for celebration. On his election, nearly 14 years ago, he became the first indigenous leader in a country previously controlled by a small elite of European descent, and he enjoyed great popularity as he led his country through a period of economic growth and shrinking inequality.
But as happens too often to people in power, he interpreted his popularity, even as it began to wane, as license to perpetuate his rule and to defy the institutions and laws of democracy, including constitutional term limits he himself had enacted.
Predictably, Mr. Morales’s left-wing allies across Latin America, including President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, President-elect Alberto Fernández of Argentina and President Miguel Díaz-Canel of Cuba, joined by the British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, cried “coup” at the fall of the last survivor of the Latin America’s “pink tide” of leftist leaders who came to power two decades ago, while right-wing leaders, including President Trump and President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, celebrated.
Yet what brought Mr. Morales down was not his ideology or foreign meddling, as he claimed, but the arrogance of the populist, evident in so many other parts of the world — the claim to be the ultimate arbiter of the will of the people, entitled to crush any institution that stands in his way. And while many in the police and military did eventually join in the protests, and the commander in chief of Bolivia’s military finally called on Mr. Morales to step down, they did so long after the protests began.
Once in power, Mr. Morales had steadily concentrated power in his hands and planted loyalists in key institutions. Nearing the two-term limit for presidents set in the Constitution he himself had helped introduce, he called a referendum that would have allowed him to stay in office indefinitely. When it was defeated, he had the Supreme Court, by now stuffed with his loyalists, rule that limiting his time in office somehow violated his human rights. That cleared a run for re-election last month, but the highly fishy vote on Oct. 20 proved to be the last straw for many Bolivians, who took the streets.
After the Organization of American States declared on Sunday that there was “clear manipulation” of the voting in October, Mr. Morales was left with no choice but to resign, bitterly tweeting from an unknown location that “The world and patriotic Bolivians will repudiate this coup.”
The fall of Mr. Morales comes at a troubled time for many democracies as millions of people from Chile to Hong Kong, mobilized by social media, have taken to the streets against arbitrary rule by governments of left and right. Though many of the uprisings have common sources, ranging from economic stagnation to inequality, rapid social change or a sense of alienation, each outbreak of discontent has its distinct causes and potential outcomes.
The citizens who went into the streets in Bolivia were not seeking to reverse Mr. Morales’s social or economic reforms, from which many of them benefited, but to uphold democratic rules and institutions he tried to subvert.
That must be the goal now of all Bolivian parties, and of the United States and other members of the Organization of American States. The abrupt resignation of Mr. Morales has left Bolivia with a vacuum of power, since other senior leaders resigned with him, and with high potential for violence between the ousted president’s supporters, of whom there are still many, and opponents.
A leading opposition politician, Jeanine Añez Chavez, the second vice president of the Senate who appears to be next in line for the presidency, went on television offering to lead the country to new elections. The sooner they can be held the better, and if Mr. Morales hopes to salvage any of his legacy, he would do well to call on his backers to clear the way.

Frieze London Shows the Art World Has Cottoned On to Weaving,"A special “Woven” section at the fair celebrates an art form that was long undervalued as a result of sexism and snobbery.
LONDON — The Frieze London fair opened on Thursday, and art dealers from all over the world have gathered for what organizers are calling the most international edition in the fair’s history. In a huge white tent in Regent’s Park, more than 165 galleries have set up their stands, and on them, you can see art made from iron, found rocks, melted glass and old televisions, all fascinatingly inventive.
But it is a more familiar, though often overlooked, material that is in focus at the fair this year.
Weaving, once looked down on by the art establishment as women’s work, or scorned as folksy craft, is now the subject of major exhibitions at prestigious museums. This year, the Met Breuer in New York, Tate Modern in London and MAXXI in Rome have staged large textile exhibitions; artists whose work features or is inspired by weaving, such Sheila Hicks, Grayson Perry, Faith Ringgold and Annie Morris, have all been praised for recent shows.
Where museums lead, the market follows, and this edition of Frieze features a special “Woven” section. (The smaller 1-54 Contemporary African Art Fair, also in London, is presenting a similar stream, titled “Thread.”)
“The initial idea was to respond to the current situation in the U.K. and how that is interwoven with its colonial legacy,” said the curator of “Woven,” Cosmin Costinas. “The use of textiles is at the core of art history here and all over the world, but it has also been marginalized, because it was associated with women and with practices with their roots outside of the West,” he added.
Ann Coxon, a curator at Tate Modern who helped oversee a recent show on the Bauhaus-trained textile artist Anni Albers, said that “For many years the art museums, fairs, biennials, et cetera, have been filled with film and lens-based media.” Yet now there was “a resurgence of interest in textile media,” she said. “It may be that the interest in hand craft has arisen at a time of global political turmoil, when people are wanting to get back to simpler ways of living, in defiance of the establishment, or of technological progress.”
Included in “Woven” is work by the Indian artist Mrinalini Mukherjee, who died in 2015, and whose posthumous retrospective “Phenomenal Nature: Mrinalini Mukherjee” at the Met Breuer in New York ended on Sunday. Ms. Mukherjee was one of few women artists working in Mumbai when she started out in the 1970s, and only received wide recognition in the last decade of her life, when she was included in a number of high-profile international group shows.
“It is people’s viewpoint that has changed,” said Aparajita Jain, the director of Nature Morte, a New Delhi-based based gallery that is presenting Ms. Mukherjee’s knotted hemp sculptures and bonze works in “Woven.” During the 1970s and 80s, people talked about Ms. Mrinalini’s work as being craft rather than art: to them weaving was something that women did in their free time, Ms. Jain said. “But I think our generation is giving it value,” she added.
Angela Su, a Hong Kong-based artist featured in “Woven,” uses human hair and silk to embroider text. In an email, she said she was “attracted to works that move beyond the seductive quality of textile, to become something that is critical or even confrontational.”
“I think contemporary art and folk art is one continuum,” she added. “Traditional craft as a medium also carries its own ‘message.’ It might seem like a thing of the past to many people, but it’s all up to artist to make it relevant to the contemporary world.”
Ms. Su, whose work deals with resistance and cultural dominance, has been working recently on pieces that react to the recent protests in Hong Kong. She was interested in using traditional crafts to explore “power relationships that sustain colonialism,” a concern shared by other artists in “Woven.”
Cian Dayrit, a Philippine artist, uses what he refers to as “countercartography” to debunk stereotypes about the indigenous people of the Philippines. He does this by creating alternative maps to those created by the country’s colonists, working with displaced indigenous people. Mr. Dayrit uses a combination of Latin, Filipino and English texts, and imagery from the period of Spanish colonial rule, to create large, hanging woven textiles.
“When are you weaving, you are crossing the threads,” said Joël Andrianomearisoa, a French-Madagascan artist who makes large textile sculptures and installations which can be seen in “Woven.”
“I like the idea of crossing things to create a strong, powerful material,” he added.
Mr. Andrianomearisoa said that combining fabrics that has been made in different countries was potently symbolic, and showed that beautiful things could emerge from cross-cultural exchange. “I think textiles reveal the complexity of the world right now,” he added.
Ms. Coxon, the Tate Modern curator, who is preparing for an exhibition of work by the textile artist Magdalena Abakanowicz to be shown at the museum next year, said that while weaving was enjoying a moment of fashion in the art world, the definitions of what constituted “fine art” were still too narrow.
“Artists themselves no longer feel the need to put themselves into any one camp,” as an artist or a craft practitioner, she said. Now, they “feel free, finally, to use whatever medium feels appropriate,” she added.
“We have to be self-conscious about what constitutes taste,” Ms. Coxon said, “and how the historic categories of art and craft have come to be defined, and by whom.”

Is a Tide Turning Against Populism?,"While most eyes are fixed on Iran and China, the competition between the liberal international order and the populist demagogues who threaten it has taken an unexpected turn. In a seemingly unlikely region, a rear-guard action has quietly begun to challenge the “populist surge.”
With Britain seemingly on the verge of Brexit and Donald Trump something of a global albatross, some analysts have written off liberalism. But others have kept faith that liberalism remains strong, and that they still expect a “backlash to the backlash” to emerge in Western Europe.
They may be right. Intriguing developments are taking place, but not necessarily in the West. Instead — surprisingly — they are to be found in Central and Eastern Europe.
The region’s countries became part of the liberal order only after the dissolution of the Soviet bloc in 1989; they have been generally considered to be partial to Russia, with a strong propensity for incubating populism that undermines democracy.
But in recent months they have become ground zero for what is beginning to look like a comeback for liberal forces, at least within the region. More than 10 different countries have voted out populists, undergone serious protests, or taken strong stands against Russia.
The reigning orthodoxy is that it’s only a matter of time until far-right populist parties begin winning elections in country after country. But the evidence from across Central Europe runs counter to that: Liberal leaders and activists have begun to push back against populism.
The most interesting case is Slovakia, where the polls leading up to this spring’s election showed a pair of populist candidates in the lead. But in the end a less bombastic Western-oriented political novice eked out an impressive victory. The victor, Zuzana Caputova, took advantage of anti-populist sentiment spurred by the murder of a crusading anti-corruption journalist.
Likewise in Poland, local elections and major mayoral races over the past two years have been won by liberal candidates, rather than Poland’s populist governing party. While in Bulgaria, in 2017, Bulgarians voted out a populist Russia-centric government and brought back to power a pro-NATO and pro-European Union former prime minister, Boiko Borisov.
What’s more, Ms. Caputova’s rise and solid block of support — both noteworthy for such a deeply conservative country — are inspiring opposition leaders in other countries. In the Czech Republic, for example, hundreds of thousands of protesters have been marching against their prime minister, Andrej Babis, a former businessman with alarmingly demagogic leanings who has been accused of corruption.
Hungary, Romania, Moldova and Georgia have also experienced significant anti-populist protests in the past two years. Hungarians turned out in large numbers this spring to protest against the most well-known populist head of government in Europe, Viktor Orban, who has a reputation for undermining democracy through his corruption, economic mismanagement and clamping down on the media. The Romanian people recently celebrated the jailing of Liviu Dragnea, the country’s most powerful politician and head of the ruling Social Democratic Party, which had defied the European Commission and made repeated efforts to shield politicians from the law.
After protests in Moldova, a liberal opposition party has entered government, albeit alongside the Russia-leaning Socialist party. And Georgians have been in the streets of Tbilisi in large protests against their quasi-populist government, which had allowed a Russian member of Parliament to give a speech inside a government building.
Central European countries have also taken strong stands or direct actions against Russia. Greece expelled Russian diplomats in response to Russian interference in the naming of North Macedonia. In 2016, Montenegro arrested a range of violent coup plotters who were backed by Russia. This year, 14 of them were convicted and sentenced to prison.
These anti-populist trends have occurred in the face of heavy Russian interference in the form of cyber warfare and in some cases the direct intervention of Federal Security Service agents. Russia also interfered in the European Parliament elections in May, which polls and pundits had predicted would bring a populist takeover. However, not only did numerous populists — like Germany’s A.F.D. party — perform less well than expected, but they are also far from being able to form a majority.
Western Europe itself has not been entirely devoid of liberal results. In Denmark, a rare national victory went to the Social Democrats over right-leaning populists last month. Populists have also been kept out of recent governments formed in Finland, Sweden and Estonia. (The Estonian prime minister has since brought a minority populist party into his governing coalition, but opinion polls indicate that the experiment is not working out very well.)
Spain’s Socialist Party routed the populists with ease, and the right-leaning young Austrian leader Sebastian Kurz, after losing a vote of confidence that cost him his role as chancellor, appears well positioned to fight for a new term in coming elections, having jettisoned the populist contingent from his coalition. And last weekend, Greece’s far-right Golden Dawn party performed surprisingly poorly in an election that brought to power a traditional center-right party and prime minister.
Yet the question remains: Is a discernible trend at work here? Either way, logic may well be on the liberals’ side. First, populist leaders tend to be poor at governing, particularly in the area of economic policy. Second, the more Russia continues to rattle its sabers and make European countries feel insecure, the more places like Poland will avoid becoming too populist. Third, while electorates in Europe have been withdrawing their support from traditional center-left and center-right parties, liberal, green and other parties offer decidedly anti-populist policies.
We may need more time to ascertain whether a larger global “backlash to the backlash” trend is afoot. But in Central Europe the evidence is clear. Major protests have also recently sprung up in Turkey, Algeria, Sudan, Kazakhstan, Venezuela and, most notably, Hong Kong. Though the trend already appears to have crested in the West, the battle against populism has been joined by regrouped liberal forces. The vaunted liberal international order, however damaged, remains intact to a significant degree.

China Warns Hong Kong Protesters Not to ‘Take Restraint for Weakness’,"HONG KONG — An official in Beijing on Tuesday issued China’s sternest denunciation yet of the demonstrations in Hong Kong, saying they had “exceeded the scope of free assembly” and warning that the semiautonomous city would not be allowed to descend into chaos.
“I want to warn all the criminals to not wrongly judge the situation and take restraint for weakness,” said Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Chinese government’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office. He warned against underestimating China’s “firm resolve and strength to safeguard the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.”
But Mr. Yang offered little in the way of concrete measures to resolve the political crisis, calling for more patriotic education and encouraging residents to confront protesters. “We need to stand up to protect our wonderful homeland,” he said.
The comments came a day after protesters in Hong Kong carried out their most widespread civil disobedience in weeks of demonstrations, blocking trains and roads and urging workers to strike. Air travel was also snarled, with more than 200 flights canceled after 2,300 civil aviation workers stayed home, according to an estimate by union officials.
Mr. Yang denounced the tactics of protesters who have surrounded police stations, throwing bricks and lighting fires, as “extreme violence that is shocking to see.”
He said, “The central government will never allow any violent attempt to push Hong Kong into a dangerous situation.”
Protesters gathered at more than a half dozen sites across Hong Kong on Monday, and the police arrested 148 people and fired 800 canisters of tear gas. The tear gas used on Monday alone came close to the 1,000 rounds that the police had used over the previous eight weeks.
Joshua Wong, a leader of the 2014 Umbrella movement and a prominent pro-democracy activist in Hong Kong, said Mr. Yang’s comments were an attempt to scare the people of the city into silence.
“Beijing does not rule Hong Kong by law, they just rule by tear gas,” he said.
The protests this summer began over a proposal that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. The government suspended that legislation in mid-June, but the protests have continued, demanding that the government fully withdraw the bill. The protesters are also angry about other issues, including allegations of police brutality and the stalled expansion of direct elections in Hong Kong.
Protesters who have clashed with the police have argued that more confrontational methods became necessary after the government rejected demands made in earlier, peaceful marches, one of which was joined by as many as two million people.
Mr. Yang also warned protesters to not challenge China’s sovereignty, denouncing those who defaced the Chinese government’s representative office in Hong Kong last month and threw Chinese flags into Victoria Harbor in recent days. He criticized protesters’ use of a slogan from an imprisoned activist who once advocated Hong Kong’s independence: “Liberate Hong Kong; revolution of our times.”
Last week, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office expressed its support for Carrie Lam, the Hong Kong chief executive, and the police, but they offered little new to resolve the political crisis. It was rare for the office to hold a news conference, and even rarer for it to hold another just a week later, an indication of the Chinese leadership’s struggle to respond to the increasingly fraught conflict in Hong Kong.
Mr. Yang reiterated on Tuesday that China backed Mrs. Lam and the police, and he said there should be no leniency in prosecuting violent crimes.
“These rioters are extremely rampant and deranged,” he said. “A blow from the sword of law is waiting for them in the future.”
Hong Kong, a former British colony, was returned to China in 1997, and it operates under a model called “one country, two systems,” which allows the city to maintain its own political and legal systems and gives residents a far greater degree of civil liberties than is seen in mainland China.
The central government is responsible for Hong Kong’s national defense and foreign relations. But many in Hong Kong fear Beijing is wielding greater influence over the city, slowly eroding its freedoms.
A spokesman for China’s Ministry of National Defense hinted last month that the People’s Liberation Army could be called on to maintain order in Hong Kong. The military has a garrison of 6,000 to 10,000 soldiers in Hong Kong, but local officials have repeatedly denied rumors that they have been preparing to help quell demonstrations.
Last week, the Hong Kong garrison released a video showing its troops training to confront protesters. And images have been released of large groups of mainland police officers holding drills in preparation for the Oct. 1 celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. Those images have also fueled unsubstantiated rumors about the possible intervention of Chinese forces.
Asked if he could rule out an intervention by the Chinese military, Mr. Yang said China would “never allow a challenge to the principle of ‘one country, two systems’ to go unpunished and will never allow any turbulence that will threaten national unity.”
Mrs. Lam warned on Monday of a crisis of “security and safety” and said “a series of extremely violent acts” was “pushing Hong Kong into very precarious circumstances.”
A group of protesters met with reporters on Tuesday to challenge the government’s portrayal of them, accusing Mrs. Lam and other top officials of dodging responsibility for the crisis.

The People’s War Is Coming in Hong Kong,"Side by side, peaceniks and radicals are revving up for the next big move.
HONG KONG — How and why have Hong Kongers managed to keep going for months, and in such large numbers, waging wave after wave of protest to oppose encroachment from China, despite the vast differences among them?
One major point of contention concerns whether to resort to nonpeaceful action and how close to skirt with violence. Take the occupation of the Hong Kong airport early last week. The sit-in, supposedly a peaceful initiative, devolved into clashes with the police and was marred after some protesters roughed up two mainlanders they suspected of being infiltrators sent by China. (One of the two turned out to be a reporter with the much-disdained Global Times, the hard-line media face of the authorities in Beijing.) Amid fears that the movement’s unity might unravel, some protesters then apologized, saying they had committed inappropriate acts in the heat of passion.
But the turnout at a student-led rally on Friday and then at another more traditional and peaceful huge march on Sunday proved those concerns wrong.
The rally, at which I spoke, was organized by the student unions of a dozen postsecondary schools, in conjunction with an influential internet protest group whose name in Cantonese slang translates ominously as “I Want to Perish Together” (meaning together with my powerful oppressor). The name reflects the prevailing sentiment, especially among the younger generations, that Hong Kong has just about exhausted all peaceful means to defend itself against China’s systematic efforts to chip away at the city’s semi-autonomy. The rally’s organizers called on the British government to declare that China, in so interfering, is violating a 1984 treaty with Britain that anticipated Hong Kong’s special status after Britain handed it over to China in 1997. They also urged the United States Congress to pass a law that would punish Hong Kong officials who blatantly violate the democratic and human rights of the city’s citizens, by freezing their assets in the United States and denying them visa privileges.
The Sunday march, for its part, focused on recent police brutality, such as the point-blank use of rubber bullets against retreating protesters. (A paramedic volunteer at the front line of a recent protest was hit in the eye by, it is widely believed, a projectile shot by the police.) Again and again, participants in Sunday’s march would cry out, “Wicked police!” and the crowd would respond, “Pay back the eye!” None too Christian, perhaps, but entirely understandable.
Ahead of these two events, worries had grown that a longstanding cleavage within the pro-democracy movement would reopen and might blunt or even derail it. After the failure of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, the so-called courageous-militant camp, a younger and more radical group with strong separatist sentiments but few adherents, split from an older and more traditional group, the so-called peaceful-rational camp, formerly known as the pan-democrats. For several years, the split was so bitter that some members of the peaceful-rational camp suspected leaders of the courageous-militant camp of being agents provocateurs paid by Beijing to sow discord.
It was easy to demonize the radicals when their numbers were small, as in 2014, but their ranks have grown enormously since. Suspicions about the courageous-militant camp began to subside when post-2014 repression disproportionally fell on it.
Now the two camps have reconciled.
When front-line protesters stormed the Legislative Council on July 1, there were hundreds, even thousands, of young supporters right behind them, acting as a buffer against any police intervention — and there have been in many not-so-peaceful street actions since.
Over the course of the summer, the older camp has realized that these more militant youngsters are their sons and daughters. A group of elderly Hong Kongers even organized a rally of the “silver-haired tribe,” as they called themselves, in support of the younger vanguard.
Sharing the goal of wanting a free and democratic Hong Kong has created a unity across methods, outlooks and generations, and this is a major reason the protests are enduring and will continue to.
There are other reasons as well. The courageous-militant camp has burned the boat with its daring street actions since July: If the movement cannot succeed in forcing the government to fully withdraw the unpopular extradition bill — which it has only suspended — and the bill eventually passes, frontliners could be among the first to face extradition to the mainland. And so they must fight on.
Many members of the movement also hope that at some point their perseverance and resistance will persuade the international community to come to its aid. With the embattled Hong Kong police apparently struggling to gain the upper hand against the more radical protesters, the Chinese authorities in Beijing have indirectly threatened to let loose the People’s Liberation Army on Hong Kong. That prompted President Trump — who until then had seemed unmoved by the protests — to warn last week that any violent intervention by China would complicate efforts to strike a trade deal. Leaders and officials in Britain, Canada and Europe and at the United Nations have issued similar statements.
President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan has also promised to give Hong Kong protesters humanitarian assistance, including by granting them refuge, if necessary. (Upward of 30 protesters reportedly had sought and been granted entry into Taiwan by mid-July.) That pledge, too, may encourage more Hong Kongers to fight harder and longer.
As they do, the Hong Kong government will struggle to stop the movement by decapitation, a strategy it employed in recent years — for example, by sending them to prison or forcing them into self-imposed exile, the leaders of organizations or parties calling for full-fledged independence for Hong Kong. On Tuesday, Carrie Lam, the city’s leader, suggested that she wanted to open a dialogue with the protesters as soon as things calm down. But with whom exactly would she communicate since the movement has no recognized representatives?
That an apparent weakness such as a lack of leaders could be an asset must be a thrill for protesters. So, too, must be holding one’s own with minimal, often homemade, equipment against police officers armed with sophisticated anti-riot gear and now three new huge water-cannon vehicles.
Back in 1938, Mao called for a “people’s war” against the imperialists — for the broad and, if needed, protracted mobilization of the people in the countryside, with whatever makeshift means, to support his ragtag collection of Communist soldiers. Today the protesters in Hong Kong are using the same idea and trying to garner strength in preparation for Oct. 1, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Communist regime in China.
So in the weeks ahead, expect the peaceful-rational wing of the protest movement to keep up the pressure on the Hong Kong authorities with low-attrition activities — such as industry-specific rallies or strikes and international lobbying — while the courageous-militant wing takes a break to strategize and organize.
The people’s war is coming again, with a surreal, postmodern twist: this time, in one of the world’s leading financial centers and against a Communist juggernaut.

"Ousted in Tiananmen Protests, a Late Chinese Leader Is Finally Given a Grave","The ashes of Zhao Ziyang, the liberal leader ousted after seeking compromise with the protesters, were laid to rest. But the uprising remains a sensitive political scar in China.
BEIJING — A century after his birth and nearly 15 years after his death, Zhao Ziyang, the reformist Chinese Communist Party leader who opposed the armed suppression of student protests in 1989, was given a quiet burial in Beijing on Friday under police guard. 
The low-key, long-delayed ceremony was the latest episode showing that even in death, Mr. Zhao remains a sensitive topic in Chinese politics.
His ashes were interred in a cemetery on the northern outskirts of Beijing during a small ceremony for close family members, ending a quarrel with the party authorities over where to place his remains. He was buried alongside the ashes of his wife, Liang Boqi, who died in 2013.
“After many years of delays, the children of Zhao Ziyang have finally been able to put to rest their long-deceased father and mother,” his children said in a statement shared by Bao Pu, a Hong Kong publisher who issued Mr. Zhao’s posthumous memoirs.
For Mr. Zhao’s family, the ceremony was a small victory in honoring his memory. After Mr. Zhao died in January 2005 at 85, the party authorities wanted to keep his ashes under heavy guard in a cemetery for officials; his family wanted more control and access, Mr. Bao said in a telephone interview. Ultimately, his ashes were stored in his old home in central Beijing.
The interment in the cemetery took place a day after the centenary of Mr. Zhao’s birth on Oct. 17, 1919, in Henan Province, central China. Usually, deceased Chinese leaders’ major anniversaries inspire laudatory speeches and editorials. But Mr. Zhao was consigned to the class of toppled former leaders whose anniversaries are smothered in official silence and stepped-up security.
Since Mr. Zhao’s downfall during the Tiananmen protests, his name has mostly been erased from the Chinese news media, histories and websites. His death in 2005 was announced in a terse statement, and a brief official obituary said that in 1989 he “committed serious errors.” Under China’s current leader, Xi Jinping, the country has turned sharply against Mr. Zhao’s ideas for measured political liberalization.
Official hints that China could send the People’s Liberation Army in to quell pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong have rekindled memories of the armed crackdown 30 years ago that ended the student-led protests in Beijing and other Chinese cities.
“Zhao is a ghost that haunts the Chinese Communist Party,” Julian B. Gewirtz, a historian of China at Harvard University who is writing a study of China in the 1980s, said by email. “He represents a different path for China’s rise — one profoundly different from Xi Jinping’s today.”
“To some he is a martyr who sought to stop the violent crackdown of 1989, and to others — in the official line — he’s an enemy who sought to bring down socialism in China,” he added.

Mr. Zhao’s children and some former officials who supported his policies used the centenary to defend his liberal legacy, and implicitly rebuke Mr. Xi’s hard-line direction. Since Mr. Xi took office in 2012, China has detained many dissidents and human rights lawyers, while liberal former officials have often been silenced. Mr. Zhao’s children said that his time as premier and Communist Party general secretary in the 1980s was an era of bold change and intellectual ferment that drew a withering contrast with China today.
“That truly was an exciting time that caused people’s hearts to jump,” they said of Mr. Zhao’s rule in a letter published Monday by Ming Pao, a newspaper published in Hong Kong, beyond mainland Chinese censors. “The whole country was prospering, officialdom and the public, in power and out, worked in tandem.”
“These days we’re confronted with ideological regression and doctrinal shortcomings,” they wrote. “There is a spiritual malaise the likes of which hasn’t been seen for a century.”
It was not clear if Mr. Zhao’s children all supported the letter — at least four sons and one daughter are still alive, Mr. Bao said.
Mr. Zhao rose to power in the 1980s, when Deng Xiaoping picked him out as a bold provincial leader with ideas on rejuvenating China’s economy, battered by the turmoil of Mao Zedong’s later years. As China’s prime minister from 1980, Mr. Zhao became a chief proponent of the market overhauls introduced in that decade, including promoting private businesses and foreign investment, as well as cutting controls on prices and supplies.
In his memoirs, Mr. Zhao said that he tried to keep a distance from ideological fights with conservatives aghast at the liberal direction that China was taking, preferring to focus on economic policy. But that became increasingly difficult after 1987, when Mr. Zhao was appointed Communist Party secretary, following the downfall of Hu Yaobang, a liberal leader who was accused of going soft on student protests.
[From our Chinese-language site:  A personal history of Mr. Zhao by a colleague who helped publish his memoirs .]
Mr. Zhao increasingly came to believe that China’s market changes could succeed only if they were accompanied by political liberalization that would free up businesses and discourage corruption, he said in his memoirs. He did not advocate outright democracy, but shrinking the party’s role and allowing more tolerance for rival views.
In 1989, Mr. Zhao lost the confidence of Deng, who supported using martial law to end the protests that erupted on Tiananmen Square and spread across the country. Mr. Zhao also wanted to end the protests, but he and his allies wanted to use negotiation and compromise to persuade the students to go back to class.
Mr. Zhao was pushed from office in May 1989, before troops moved in to clear Tiananmen Square, starting on June 3 and going into the early hours of June 4. Hundreds died as the troops pressed into Beijing, according to most estimates.
The party denounced Mr. Zhao as a turncoat who had revealed splits in the leadership and defied Deng’s will. Mr. Zhao, who refused to admit to any wrongdoing, was never tried. He spent his late years largely confined to his courtyard home. But even under virtual house arrest, he remained a worry for the party, and after his death, he has continued to be a troublesome icon.
In his posthumously published memoirs and other books that chronicled his thoughts — recorded by visitors and spirited out of his home — he defended his record and embraced increasingly forthright democratic views.
“China’s failure to transform toward democracy runs against the global tide,” Mr. Zhao said according to Zong Fengming, a friend of Mr. Zhao who published their conversations. The interview with Mr. Zong, who died in 2010, was released for the centenary. Mr. Zhao said: “Sooner or later we must take that path.""

How Hong Kong’s Leader Made the Biggest Political Retreat by China Under Xi,"HONG KONG — Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong, has a very loyal majority in the territory’s legislature. She has the complete backing of the Chinese government. She has a huge bureaucracy ready to push her agenda.
Yet on Saturday, she was forced to suspend indefinitely her monthslong effort to win passage of a bill that would have allowed her government to extradite criminal suspects to mainland China, Taiwan and elsewhere. Mrs. Lam’s decision represented the biggest single retreat on a political issue by China since Xi Jinping became the country’s top leader in 2012.
Huge crowds of demonstrators had taken to Hong Kong’s streets in increasingly violent protests. Local business leaders had turned against Mrs. Lam. And even Beijing officials were starting to question her judgment in picking a fight on an issue that they regard as a distraction from their real priority: the passage of stringent national security legislation in Hong Kong.
[Update:  Protestors return to Hong Kong streets, rejecting Carrie Lam’s apology .]
The risk for the Hong Kong government is that the public, particularly the young, may develop the impression that the only way to stop unwanted policy initiatives is through violent protests. With each successive major issue since Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997, the level of violence at protests has risen before the government has relented and changed course.
As many as a million people marched peacefully a week ago against the extradition bill. But the government’s stance did not begin to shift until a smaller demonstration unfolded on Wednesday. It began peacefully until some protesters pried up bricks and threw them at police officers, and police responded by firing rubber bullets and tear gas.
At a news conference on Saturday afternoon, Mrs. Lam denied that she was acting simply to prevent further violence at a planned rally on Sunday.
“Our decision has nothing to do with what may happen tomorrow,” she said. “It has nothing to do with an intention — a wish — to pacify.”
[Follow our coverage of Sunday’s protests here.]
But that assertion drew broad skepticism. Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political scientist at Hong Kong Baptist University, said the family-friendly march a week ago was not enough to send a message.
“Without a bit of violence and political pressure on the authorities, you don’t get a thing,” he said.
Anson Chan, who was Hong Kong’s second-highest official until her retirement in 2001 and now a democracy advocate, said, “Denied a vote at the ballot box, people are forced to take to the streets to make their voices heard.”
[Read about  the reactions  of protesters, civil rights groups and others to the suspension of the bill.]
In the first years after Hong Kong’s handover in 1997, the government tended to be more responsive. A previous government had given up passing national security legislation in 2003 after 500,000 people marched peacefully.
That march was so tame that not a single person was arrested and the staff at an Van Cleef & Arpels jewelry store at the end of the protesters’ route did not close their steel security shutters or even remove the extremely expensive diamond jewelry from the store’s windows.
The extradition bill debacle underlines Beijing’s central dilemma in Hong Kong. It wants to retain complete control, and so does not want to allow full democracy in the semiautonomous territory.
But without democracy, a succession of Hong Kong governments have blundered into political crises by underestimating or ignoring the public’s concerns — and each time, Beijing gets some of the blame. Some of her close advisers say that it is unclear whether she had any discussion with Beijing leaders in advance about the extradition bill.
On Saturday, Mrs. Lam repeatedly declined to discuss her conversations with Beijing leaders.
The Hong Kong government has also proved steadily more prone to push on, at least initially, in the face of public outcry.
Hong Kong’s leaders increasingly echo top Beijing officials in perceiving malevolent foreign forces in stirring up protests. That foreign influence appears to consist of meetings that Hong Kong democracy advocates have arranged with American officials and politicians when they fly to Washington.
But Mrs. Lam and her senior advisers have nonetheless distrusted the sincerity of the protesters.
“The riots I believe were instigated by foreign forces and it is sad that the young people of Hong Kong have been manipulated into taking part,” said Joseph Yam, a member of Mrs. Lam’s Executive Council, the territory’s top advisory body.
Suspicions of foreign influence make Saturday’s retreat by Mrs. Lam even more surprising. But the path to this week’s public policy fiasco really appears to have begun last November.
That was when Mrs. Lam and her top aides traveled to Beijing for a rare meeting with Mr. Xi. He gave a long speech telling them to safeguard national security, according to a transcript released by the official Xinhua news agency.
The speech included what looked like a message that Hong Kong could not postpone indefinitely its legal duty under the Basic Law, its mini-constitution, to implement national security laws against sedition, subversion, secession and treason.
“Compatriots in Hong Kong and Macau should improve the systems and mechanisms related to the implementation of the Constitution and the Basic Law,” Mr. Xi said.
But the 2003 experience underlined how hard it would be to pass national security legislation. Mrs. Lam was also deeply troubled last winter by another issue.
She had received five letters from the parents of a young woman who was slain in Taiwan, allegedly by her boyfriend who then returned to Hong Kong. The absence of an extradition arrangement between Hong Kong and Taiwan, an island democracy that Beijing regards as part of China, complicated the extradition of the young man.
[Read about  the murder in Taiwan  that led Mrs. Lam to introduce the extradition bill.]
Mrs. Lam decided that a short bill — just 10 articles — should be introduced in the legislature to make it easier to extradite people.
The bill was brought to a meeting of the Executive Council, a top advisory body, right before a three-day Chinese New Year holiday, and was approved with virtually no discussion, said a person familiar with the council’s deliberations who insisted on anonymity.
The council consists of the government’s ministers plus 16 business leaders and pro-Beijing lawmakers. A holdover from the colonial era, the council is often criticized as an insular group with little to no accountability.
The week after the holiday, Mrs. Lam promptly announced the legislation.
But the bill also called for police to provide what is known in legal jargon as “mutual legal assistance in criminal matters.” Hong Kong’s top finance officials and leading financiers, who were at the meeting right before Chinese New Year, had not been alerted that the extradition bill would also allow mainland security agencies to start requesting asset freezes in Hong Kong.
They were appalled when they learned that this was involved, said the person with a detailed knowledge of the meeting. Mr. Yam did not discuss the council meeting but other people familiar with the meeting did so on condition of anonymity because of rules banning disclosure of the council’s activities.
Mrs. Lam’s bill exposed not only Hong Kong citizens to extradition to the mainland but also foreign citizens. That horrified the influential chambers of commerce that represent the West’s biggest banks, which almost all have their Asia headquarters in Hong Kong, as well as some of the West’s biggest manufacturers, which keep staff in Hong Kong while overseeing factories on the mainland.
The business community began pressing for a halt to the extradition bill. With the government having now stopped consideration of that bill, even Mrs. Lam’s allies in Hong Kong say that she almost certainly does not retain enough political capital to pass the national security legislation that Beijing really wanted.
Shortcomings in the Hong Kong government’s handling of the extradition issue underline that the chief executive is only accountable to Beijing. Yet Beijing has also promised Hong Kong a “high degree of autonomy.”
The Communist leadership likes the political structure because it ensures the loyalty of the Hong Kong government, and it rebuffed protesters who demanded free elections five years ago. But the system means Hong Kong’s leader often misreads and sometimes ignores public opinion and operates with limited feedback even from Beijing.
“Had the chief executive been elected by Hong Kong people instead of by Beijing, perhaps he or she would not have tabled that bill,” Mr. Cabestan said.

Covering Protests Where There Is a Distrust of Social Media,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Daniel Victor, a reporter in Hong Kong who covers news in Asia and overnight news in the United States, discussed the tech he’s using.
What are your most important tech tools for doing your job?
My desktop assaults me with a terrible mess of information from far too many sources, and I like it almost as much as I hate it. To cope with that onslaught, or perhaps to enable it, I connect my MacBook Pro to two external monitors.
One is dedicated entirely to TweetDeck, which allows me to mainline Twitter in deeply unhealthy ways. When you open the Twitter app on your phone, you see a single column of tweets; now imagine you had 14 similar columns with individual, narrow focuses, all updating in real time. That’s what TweetDeck does for me, with custom lists I’ve created of news organizations, Hong Kong tweeters, my personal friends, Times journalists, and Philadelphia 76ers reporters and fans. It’s out of control.
But that’s not the only way I suffocate myself, as I almost always have several dozen tabs open in Google Chrome. When I’m feeling truly overwhelmed, I use the OneTab extension to close them all but produce a handy list of links to each page I just closed. It can be a lifesaver.
I still cover quite a bit of news in the United States, just from a different time zone, so my other tech needs are built around pretending I’m still there.
If your phone was ringing and you saw the call was from an unknown number in another country, would you pick up? Many of the sources I’m calling probably wouldn’t, I figure. Luckily, Google Voice allowed me to keep my American cellphone number — I can place free calls from Gmail on my desktop and it’ll show up on caller ID as the same central Pennsylvania number I’ve had for years.
I also encounter some crucial websites that are available only inside the United States. I use NordVPN, a virtual private network, to trick the websites into giving me access.
What have you noticed about the difference between the way people use tech in Hong Kong versus the United States?
SMS is no longer part of my life. Instead, WhatsApp is universally used here for texting, both by my friends and sources. This is very common almost everywhere outside the United States, I’ve learned, and I’ve had to talk many of my American friends into using it to keep in touch.
Hong Kong uses Octopus, a contactless card, for its subway system, and it can also be used at 7-Elevens and many restaurants. It’s very handy. I also find there are more businesses that take Apple Pay — I don’t use my physical credit card nearly as often as I used to.
There are a few things I wish I could have from back home. I deeply miss Venmo for settling small debts between friends, like a happy hour tab, and Google Maps has a nasty habit here of placing me about a block away from where I am, making it much less useful.
You recently covered some of the Hong Kong protests over the extradition law. How did marchers use tech?
The demonstrations thus far have been mostly leaderless — there’s no single person or organization deciding what comes next. Instead, they’re directly voting on what actions to take by participating in online discussion forums, the most popular one being LIHKG.
An individual will post with a suggested course of action, like protesting outside a specific building at a specific time. Other participants can upvote or downvote the post, and when a post gets enough attention, they solidify those plans.
They’ve also used messaging apps like Telegram to communicate those plans and organize logistics, but a lot of protesters are wary of it after the police arrested the administrator of a group that had 20,000 members. There’s a lot of fear that the government will use their digital footprint against them.
A lot of protesters also share important information through the AirDrop feature of iPhones. I was anonymously sent two images while covering a demonstration, and I’ve had friends report they’ve been dropped images while commuting on the train.
Another key difference is in how they have a far more hands-off approach to social media than any comparable effort in the United States would. Whereas a lot of demonstrations in the United States would be grist for selfies and Instagram-ready signs, protesters here are very concerned the government could identify their faces in photos and later charge them with crimes. Many hide behind surgical masks and would never post evidence of themselves taking part. They discourage people, even news photographers, from taking photos where faces are identifiable. It’s not built for gaining likes, and they trust exposure will come through the larger messaging.
You have been learning Cantonese. What apps and online programs have helped with that?
Since I’m still awful at it, I use an app called Hong Kong Taxi Cards to show taxi drivers an image with my desired address written in Cantonese.
Pleco is handy for quick translations, and includes audio files so I can come close to getting the pronunciation right. Google Translate has been pretty handy for audio translations whenever I travel.
Outside of work, what’s your favorite tech gadget or app and what do you use it for?
I love One Second Everyday, an app that will cobble together a video of one-second snippets. I found it a great way to smash together a year’s worth of memories when I wrote about using it in 2015, and I’m doing it again this year to document my first year in Hong Kong. I may annoy my friends by taking videos every time we’re together, but it’ll be worth it.
Can you please bid us adieu in Cantonese?
Bai baai! (It sounds just like bye-bye.)

"Wang Guodong, Who Painted Mao Year After Year, Dies at 88","BEIJING — His portraits were among the most recognizable in the world, rivaling the Mona Lisa.
But few have heard of Wang Guodong, the Chinese artist who for years was responsible for painting the enormous portrait of Mao Zedong — replaced annually — that gazes down on Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
Mr. Wang, who was 88 when he died on Friday at a hospital in Beijing, was chosen in 1964, when he was in his early 30s, to be the official painter of the 15-by-20-foot oil portrait of Mao that hangs steps from the party’s central seat of power, at the Gate of Heavenly Peace.
Portraits of Mao have been installed there since 1949, when the Communists took power in China; they are frequently replaced because they are exposed to the elements. (A portrait of Chiang Kai-shek, the Nationalist leader who lost the civil war to Mao’s Communists, had hung there previously.)
The job was one of the highest — and most intimidating — honors available to a painter in China. In a sign of Mr. Wang’s stature in Communist Party circles, a funeral was held for him on Sunday at Babaoshan, the cemetery in Beijing reserved for party elite, Beijing Youth Daily reported. Mao Xinyu, Mao’s grandson, was said to have sent a wreath.
Over the years, Mao’s appearance evolved as portraits were swapped out. At one point he was depicted wearing an octagonal cap and a coarse woolen jacket. But even after Mr. Wang stepped down as official portrait maker in 1976, his successors continued to paint identical portraits based on Mr. Wang’s design, showing a rosy-cheeked, grim-looking Mao with his trademark chin mole.
But despite the portrait’s prominence, the artist is little known.
“Nobody is allowed to put their names on that painting,” Mr. Wang explained in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 2006. “It’s that way before, and it’s that way now.”
Mr. Wang appeared not to mind. For him, anonymity came with the job of creating what one prominent art historian called “the most important painting in China.”
But like many who lived through the turbulence of Mao’s totalitarian rule, Mr. Wang was not always in such good standing with the party.
During the Cultural Revolution, the decade-long period of political tumult that convulsed the country from 1966 to 1976, Mao’s image was prominently displayed in millions of homes, schools, factories and government buildings across the country. As the leader’s personality cult grew, Mr. Wang found himself under attack by the student militants known as Red Guards, who persecuted anyone they considered ideologically impure or insufficiently devoted to Mao.
They called Mr. Wang a capitalist because of his family background, and they criticized him for painting Mao from an angle that showed only one ear. This, they said, implied that Mao was listening to only a select few, not the masses.
“How many ears I painted was not up to me,” Mr. Wang later explained. “It was decided by the central government.” He said all of the artists who painted Mao did so based on a government-issued photo and were instructed not to deviate from it.
Nevertheless, Mr. Wang was subjected to a so-called struggle session, in which he was brought onto a stage and publicly humiliated. Mosquitoes were swarming around him, but “I didn’t even dare to swat them away,” he recalled in a 2004 interview with a Chinese magazine.
As punishment, Mr. Wang was sent by the authorities to work as a carpenter in a framing factory for two years. But he was allowed to keep his title, and he continued to paint the official portrait, this time with two ears.
In the 1970s, Mr. Wang selected 10 Beijing art students as apprentices. They were screened first for their political reliability and second for their artistic ability. They were taught the basics of portrait painting and learned how to stay within the boundaries of political acceptability.
“Mao’s face must be painted extra red to show his robust spirit,” Liu Yang, one of the students, told The Los Angeles Times in 2006. “It can never be too yellow, which would seem sickly, like he hadn’t eaten in days. You could be accused of being a counterrevolutionary.”
Only once, after Mao’s death in 1976, was a black-and-white portrait of the chairman hung on the Gate of Heavenly Peace. Mr. Wang retired that year.
Since then, in keeping with tradition, the portrait has been replaced with a new one every year, under cover of darkness, just before National Day celebrations on Oct. 1.
Wang Guodong was born on June 25, 1931, in Beijing. Little could be determined about his youth or his family life. His death was reported by Chinese state media. Survivors include two sons.
The Mao portraits, still based on a version designed by Mr. Wang, have varied little in recent decades. Each is seen by millions of tourists every year as they visit Tiananmen Square and the Palace Museum.
The portraits have been vandalized several times, including during the pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989, when three young demonstrators pelted one with ink-filled eggs. Hours later, the defaced portrait was taken down and replaced with a spare. The protesters served lengthy prison sentences.
“It’s a very complex image,” Wu Hung, an art historian at the University of Chicago, said of the painting in a 2006 New York Times article. “It has different meanings to different people. To the party, it symbolizes the party and the nation’s founding. But to a lot of people it symbolizes China, or it has very personal memories.”
Since Mao’s death and China’s subsequent economic reforms, the demand for Mao paintings in China has waned. But over the years, artists have experimented with the once-sacred image.
In the late 1980s, in a subtle nod to the portrait’s artificiality, the Chinese artist Wang Guangyi depicted it overlaid with a grid structure, a technique that Wang Guodong and his successors had used to copy the portrait to scale.
Mao’s image was also, famously, an inspiration for Andy Warhol, whose silk-screened images turned the ruthless leader into something of an international pop icon. In 2017, a Warhol painting of Mao sold to an unidentified Asian buyer at a Sotheby’s auction in Hong Kong for $12.6 million.
In the Warhol painting, Mao is shown with one ear.

Xi Extols China’s ‘Red’ Heritage in a Land Haunted by Famine Under Mao,"XINYANG, China — Harrowing memories of China’s revolutionary past hang over the rolling wheat fields and scattered villages where the Communist Party’s leader, Xi Jinping, recently visited to commemorate 70 years since Mao Zedong founded the People’s Republic.
Yet not all who died here in the Xinyang region during Mao’s tumultuous era were honored during Mr. Xi’s political pilgrimage.
Mr. Xi bowed in tribute at a memorial for 130,000 fighters from this area in central China who gave their lives for the Communist cause. But the estimated one million peasants who starved to death in Xinyang, after Mao’s Great Leap Forward spawned the biggest famine in modern times, went unnoted in official reports about the visit.
Who was remembered, or overlooked, put in sharp relief Mr. Xi’s authoritarian recasting of Chinese history.
[Read  live updates to China’s National Day parade and Hong Kong protests  .]
The pageantry of the 70th anniversary reveals how thoroughly the party has rewritten China’s past to reflect Mr. Xi’s turn to communist traditionalism — what he calls reviving the party’s “red genes.” He offers an unabashedly triumphant vision of China’s past, and its future. It is a patriotic message that resonates with many Chinese, even in Xinyang, a region of rural counties and towns that suffered greatly under Mao.
“This red land was hard won and paid for with the fresh blood of tens of millions of revolutionary forebears,” Mr. Xi said when he honored revolutionary “martyrs” in Xinyang in mid-September, according to an official account. “We must always recall where red power came from and cherish the memories of our revolutionary martyrs.”
In his seven years in power, Mr. Xi has acted on the belief that to control China he must control its history. His administration has molded textbooks, television shows, movies and museums to match his narrative of national unity and rejuvenation under iron party rule.
Under him, the Communist Party has promoted revolutionary nostalgia and played down the strife of the Mao era. The anniversary celebrations, which culminate on Tuesday with a military parade in Beijing, have reinforced this rosy depiction of the past 70 years as a near-uninterrupted march of economic and technological progress, enshrining them through oversize floral displays in Beijing. On Monday, Mr. Xi paid his respects to Mao’s preserved body in a mausoleum in Tiananmen Square.
Mr. Xi’s recasting of China’s history has left less and less room to reflect on traumas like the tens of millions who starved to death across the country from 1958 to 1960. That worries scholars who believe that the calamities of that time still offer lessons for China.
Harvests fell drastically short of the miraculous yields that officials had promised in the Great Leap Forward, a feverish campaign to propel China into communist plenty. As hulking collectivized farms failed, the government seized grain from peasants who were accused of hiding supplies. Starvation spread. So did persecution of peasants accused of resisting grain seizures.
Xinyang suffered worse than nearly any place in China. Out of eight million residents, about one million died of undernourishment and other abuses, according to secret official reports at the time.
In Gaodadian Village in Xinyang, two mounted stones stand etched with the names of 72 people who starved to death in this settlement of around 120 residents. The memorial, half hidden among bushes, is the only one around here, or perhaps anywhere in China, for victims of the Great Leap famine.
Elderly farmers nearby recalled famished parents who died after eating grass that clotted their intestines; swallowing weeds and tree bark to stave off hunger; tearing open pillows to boil and eat the wheat husks inside; and occasions of cannibalism when ravenous villagers cut flesh from corpses.
“This will let them know about this terrible lesson, so that it cannot be repeated,” said Wu Yongkuan, 75, a retired village accountant who built the memorial 15 years ago mostly to honor his father, Wu Dejin. He died in the famine after being denounced by officials for asking for more food for fellow villagers.
“Their voices and faces remain with us, in the embrace of eternity,” says a dedication written on the side of the names. “Dignity and decency always resplendent, models of all that is worthy.”
Still, Mr. Xi’s patriotic telling of Chinese history attracts quite a few admirers, especially in rural areas like Henan Province, where views tend to be more conservative. The notion of a “good ruler” in Beijing — a leader whose noble intentions are thwarted only by venal local bureaucrats — runs deep. People can nurse bitter memories of hardship under Mao while still revering him as a great revolutionary who liberated China and its peasants.
For decades, the party has reinforced the theme that even in the worst of times, Mao and other top leaders in Beijing were on the side of the people. Reports and investigations mostly shielded them from public criticism. After Mao died, Deng Xiaoping pressed to ensure that he was not swept into the dustbin of condemnation like Stalin had been in the Soviet Union.
In Xinyang, many residents blamed the famine on wayward local officials, especially Lu Xianwen, the party secretary of Xinyang who was accused of hiding the mounting deaths. “It wasn’t his fault,” Mr. Wu said of Mao. “The central leaders didn’t know.”
Most Chinese scholars who have studied the famine and other upheavals are much less forgiving of Mao. Local officials who concealed the growing disaster came under immense pressure not to risk stirring Mao’s wrath.
The question of Mao’s culpability remained politically charged, said Zhu Jianguo, a former journalist in southern China who has written about the famine in Xinyang. “There’s an ancient Chinese saying: If the many regions commit offenses, the responsibility lies on my person,” Mr. Zhu said, citing words supposedly uttered by an emperor. “How could this have nothing to do with him?”
While the Communist Party has long constrained historians from delving into its past, Deng and later leaders allowed some debate. Books and academic papers examined the Great Leap Forward. Former officials who had enforced Mao’s policies at the local level wrote pained memoirs.
Exposing the party’s historical setbacks has become increasingly unwelcome under Mr. Xi.
Soon after he was appointed Communist Party leader in late 2012, Mr. Xi spoke of a “China dream” of national strength rising after centuries of foreign subjugation. He denounced “historical nihilism,” the party’s term for accounts of the past that dwell on its errors.
Although he was the son of a party veteran persecuted by Mao, Mr. Xi sought to shore up Mao’s reputation. He warned officials in 2013 to take heed of the unraveling of the Soviet Union, when liberal historians dismantled its revolutionary heritage.
“Why did the Soviet Union disintegrate? Why did the Soviet Communist Party collapse?” Mr. Xi said. One important reason, he said, was that its leaders had allowed Stalin, Lenin and Soviet history to be denigrated.
“There’s a lesson in that for us,” Mr. Xi said.
Access to archives came under heavy restrictions in recent years. Party officials engineered a takeover of a magazine that specialized in unvarnished accounts of party history, turning it into a tame publication. Pro-Mao writers have argued in party-run journals that the Great Leap famine was not nearly as bad as previous scholars found, including in Xinyang.
“Critical voices have been silenced,” said Hong Zhenkuai, an independent historian who has challenged the denials of catastrophic famine. “The danger is that if you don’t reflect on the errors of the past, don’t acknowledge the mistakes that were made, you’re incapable of drawing warnings from history.”
Outwardly, few provinces in China would seem more welcoming to Mr. Xi’s traditionalist message than Henan, where he visited ahead of the anniversary. Many villagers, including Mr. Wu, here said they admired Mr. Xi as a strong leader in Mao’s footsteps, and they often hang portraits of both leaders on the walls of their homes.
In 2016, a county in Henan erected a gold-colored 120-foot statue of Mao. Officials tore it down only after criticism spread of the garish sight.
But Henan’s modern history is also scarred with upheavals.
Apart from war and famine, there were huge floods in 1975 that killed tens of thousands, when poorly built dams collapsed after storms. In the 1990s, the province had an outbreak of AIDS among tens of thousands — some experts say many more — of poor farmers after officials let H.I.V. spread through a trade in tainted blood. Farmers who sold their plasma were given transfusions with the leftover blood products that had often been infected through poor hygiene.
Mr. Wu’s son, Wu Ye, 51, helped his father build the famine memorial in their home village. He said he grasped the enormity of the suffering only after he moved to the United States and read a Chinese-language book about that era, “Man-Made Catastrophe,” published in Hong Kong in 1991.
“On the internet there’s all those people who say that it’s nonsense, that so many people couldn’t possibly have died,” the younger Mr. Wu said in a telephone interview from Buffalo. “I wanted to somehow prove that this happened.”
In Xinyang, memories of famine survive in family lore. On a recent visit, villagers in their 60s and 70s paused to count and name parents and siblings who died 60 years ago.
“Nowadays we have enough to eat, but back then we went for days and days without anything,” said Chen Xueying, a 71-year-old farmer who paused from picking beans to describe how she watched her mother and a sister die in the famine. She teared up.
“We suffered a lot,” she said. “They’re all gone.”

Hong Kong’s Protesters Are Resisting China With Anarchy and Principle,"HONG KONG — The protests that have roiled Hong Kong for weeks, combining vast marches with small guerrilla operations of civil disobedience, are not the radical development that some say. They are a natural extension of protests past — an upgrade of the 2014 Umbrella Movement’s peaceful tactics of occupation. And they are a natural reaction to changing political circumstances, including a proposed bill that would allow, in effect, the extradition to mainland China of anyone in Hong Kong wanted by the Chinese authorities. The Chinese government’s power grab is accelerating the metabolism of the city’s protest movement.
Most of the leaders of past protests have been sidelined. The academics Benny Tai Yiu-ting and Chan Kin-man, some pro-democracy legislators and other well-known activists have been imprisoned for their roles in the 2014 sit-ins. The so-called Fishball Revolution in 2016 brought some participants, like Edward Leung Tin-kei, lengthy sentences on rioting charges. Others are in exile abroad.
But the absence of these former leaders has had a liberating effect on protesters today. People organize spontaneously using social media and Telegram. Without the old elites, a massive gathering can rapidly splinter or spin off into small, nimble side operations — as happened on Thursday night, when after a big rally calling for support from world leaders attending the Group of 20 summit meeting this weekend, a few thousand protesters marched on to the city’s police headquarters. There is no recognized figurehead to issue instructions, and the people wouldn’t follow those anyway.
On June 21, thousands of protesters surrounded the police headquarters for the first time. They demanded the withdrawal of the extradition bill, as well as the release of protesters who were arrested following an earlier clash with the police and the withdrawal of any rioting charges, which could mean long prison sentences, against them. The foreign media’s favorite icon of the Umbrella Movement, Joshua Wong, who had been released from a short detention just days earlier, addressed the crowd proposing that it vote on an internet forum about whether to continue the siege or leave. It didn’t care for the idea or even much react to his presence.
Pro-democracy legislators, known locally as the pan-dems, aren’t calling for any specific action; their role in the movement is largely supportive and protective. During the night of June 11-12, the police tried to prevent people from mobilizing by going into subway stations, stopping young pedestrians and searching their belongings. As anger mounted within the public, some lawmakers rushed to the scene to intervene. On June 21, Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung, of the Labor Party, stepped in to mediate after protesters held up a police van and heckled the officers inside.
Yet if the movement is leaderless and anarchic, it isn’t chaotic. It has guiding principles that allow participants to self-regulate even as the movement constantly reinvents itself.
Among those principles is “不割席” (“do not split”). Protesters use the expression to say that no one in the movement should condemn or obstruct the actions of fellow protesters they disagree with. People who oppose a given action should sit it out, but not try to prevent it.
The use of force, in particular, is a divisive issue. Some insist on the necessity of keeping the protests peaceful, so that they will seem morally legitimate and may gain sympathy from the broader public. Others — especially younger protesters or protesters who consider that the lengthy sit-ins of the Umbrella Movement failed — believe that some measure of force has become necessary; otherwise, the government will simply ignore them.
The “do not split” idea acts as a bridge between these two factions by promoting mutual respect for diverging views within the protest movement. Not everyone embraces this code of conduct either, but it seems to be prevailing so far. And with good results: The movement remains cohesive despite being disparate. The more radical protesters at the front lines have also largely behaved with restraint — rationally and tactically. They have provoked the police, sometimes forcefully, but not with outright violence.
There was a great turnout for the first big march against the extradition bill on June 9 — about one million people, the city’s largest demonstration until then — but it also felt like something of a last gasp. That night, some younger protesters weren’t done and didn’t want to go home. They went to the Legislative Council building with no plan and hardly any equipment. They knew only that they couldn’t let the bill be passed — or even discussed, as planned, on June 12. If it became law, Hong Kong would never be the same.
It was the Hong Kong police that lapsed into violence on June 12, beating protesters and journalists, and firing off 150 rounds of tear gas against a crowd of peaceful demonstrators. The authorities have since said they were considering just five people on riot-related charges. Officers also lost control emotionally, throwing curses and obscenities at protesters and journalists. (Now there are T-shirts with the slurs.) A few days later, two million Hong Kongers marched again, once more against the extradition bill — which the government had suspended but not fully withdrawn — but this time also against police brutality.
The protesters’ most powerful weapon is the police’s own violence. Or to put the point more bleakly: If the police hadn’t been violent on June 12, would the bill have been suspended?
For years, only peaceful protests have seemed acceptable to the people of Hong Kong. But that’s because until recently they haven’t had to pay the full price for their opinions about politics in Beijing.
During British colonial times, many Hong Kong people identified with mainland China, the motherland, and were deeply interested in developments there. But colonialism also acted as a shield. The British authorities quashed Communist-led riots in 1967. And Hong Kongers could support the student protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989 without risking any reprisals. They were patriotic from a safe distance.
But after the British handed formal control of Hong Kong to China in 1997, and as political and economic pressure from China intensified, more and more people in the city have identified as Hong Kongers rather than as Chinese, Chinese living in Hong Kong or Hong Kong-Chinese. They have also increasingly borne the brunt of the Chinese government’s growing authoritarianism.
Hong Kongers are finally beginning to emancipate themselves from their old views. But the process is still at an early stage.
Although two million Hong Kongers — another record — took to the streets on June 16 against the prospect of being subjected to Chinese law, not many would say that they want independence for Hong Kong. Even opponents of the extradition bill and veteran proponents of democracy cling to the notion that “one country, two systems” — the principle that formally governs relations between Hong Kong and the mainland, and that is supposed to protect the city’s relative autonomy — still means something. But what is the refusal to be ruled by another state’s laws if not a call for self-governance or independence?
Hong Kongers may be bashful out of fear: The government in Beijing has made clear that it will not tolerate talk of independence. But many people hold these somewhat incoherent positions because they are still in denial.
These contradictions will not last, however; they cannot survive China’s continued encroachment.
There is a lull at the moment. The police are staying put and officials out of view. Protesters are maintaining the pressure with small daily operations: momentarily disrupting public services, delivering petitions to consulates. They also seem to be hoping that President Trump can somehow pressure President Xi Jinping of China when the two leaders meet at the Group of 20 gathering this weekend.
But if nothing gives after the summit, if the Hong Kong government continues to reject the protesters’ demands, the situation will have to get more chaotic. People here know that time is not on their side. And Monday, July 1, is the anniversary of the city’s handover from Britain to China.
This a moment of desperate hope. One-quarter of Hong Kong’s population has marched against Mr. Xi’s attempt to extend the Chinese Communist Party’s absolute rule to the city.After that, how could things go back to normal?
China is likely to seek revenge for our recent audacity. But punishing Hong Kongers would only unite us further.

When China Massacred Its Own People,"Thirty years ago in the spring of 1989, as the world’s most populous country teetered on the edge of freedom, I received a late-night phone call in my apartment in Beijing: The Chinese Army was invading its own capital.
Students and workers had made roads impassable by setting up barricades to block the army, so I jumped on my bicycle and pedaled furiously toward the gunfire. I reached Tiananmen Square shortly before the army, and then I watched as soldiers fired their automatic weapons directly at the crowd that I was in.
I was then the Beijing bureau chief of The Times, and I ran around that evening, the notebook clutched in my hand stained with the sweat of fear, to document horrors that remain seared into my memory. You never forget watching young people, some of the nation’s best and brightest, full of passion and idealism, stand up to machine guns — and then in an instant crumple bloody and lifeless on the ground.
Until that evening, millions of Chinese had marched freely for seven weeks in hundreds of cities across the country, denouncing corruption and seeking greater democracy. Sculptors had created a huge “Goddess of Democracy,” a Chinese version of the Statue of Liberty. Hope filled the air.
Then came the soldiers, firing not only on the crowds but even on families watching in horror from balconies. Troops fired at ambulances rescuing the wounded. Winter fell on China, and in political terms it hasn’t left.
It is indisputably true that China has dazzled economically, and critics like me should be humbled that life expectancy is today longer in Beijing (82 years) than in Washington, D.C. (77 years). The 10 percent most disadvantaged Shanghai 15-year-olds score better in math than the 10 percent most privileged 15-year-olds in America.
China is not like the old Soviet Union, which both impoverished and repressed people. Rather, China has saved lives, built universities at a rate of one a week and lifted more people out of poverty than any other country in human history — but it is deeply human, as one protester put it in 1989, to seek not just rice but also rights.
My memories of the massacre in Beijing are not only of government savagery but also of unparalleled courage on the part of the most humble citizens. I will never forget the rickshaw drivers, for whenever there was a pause in the gunfire, they would pedal their three-wheeled bicycle carts out toward the troops to pick up the wounded and rush them to the nearest hospital.
I particularly recall one burly rickshaw driver. He had a couple of bleeding people on the back of his cart and was pedaling furiously, his legs straining. He saw me and swerved toward me so that I could bear witness to his government’s brutality. As he passed, he pleaded with me: Tell the world!
And tears were streaming down his cheeks.
He was probably a peasant from the countryside with little education, and he might not have been able to define democracy — but he was risking his life for it.
That same night, further east, a middle-aged man working as a bus driver used his public bus to block the road and keep truckloads of troops from attacking the student protesters. An army officer pulled out his sidearm and pointed it at the bus driver’s head: Move the bus!
The driver took the vehicle key and hurled it as far as he could into the bushes beside the road.
Thirty years have passed since that bloody night. Beijing has patched up the bullet pockmarks along the Avenue of Eternal Peace and repaired the tank damage to Tiananmen Square. Chinese propaganda has scrubbed the democracy movement and massacre from history, so that many young Chinese have no idea that the Communist Party massacred its own people.
President Xi Jinping may feel reassured. Authoritarianism has flowered around the world. The American president defends a Russian autocrat, a Saudi Mad Prince, a Philippine ruler who presides over a dirty war, a Hungarian authoritarian and others.
But those of us who witnessed Beijing Spring are confident that eventually, unpredictably, the tide of freedom will roll in again. Paradoxically, the Communist Party has helped sow the seeds of its eventual demise by nurturing the rise of an educated middle class that is more difficult to fool, bully and bribe into perpetual submission.
Xi may think he has triumphed by burying history, stifling Hong Kong, suppressing religion, strangling the internet, imprisoning lawyers and journalists, and erasing the truth of what I saw three decades ago, but Chinese scholars often quote the writer Lu Xun after an earlier massacre: “Lies written in ink cannot disguise facts written in blood.”
One day I believe we will witness the arrival of freedom in the world’s most populous country. In my mind’s eye, I envision a memorial erected on Tiananmen Square to the heroes of 1989, perhaps taking the form of a weeping rickshaw driver with a wounded student.

The Murder Case That Lit the Fuse in Hong Kong,"HONG KONG — Before the mass street protests, the tear gas and the clashes with the police, before the government went all out for legislation that could threaten Hong Kong’s special status in China, and then abruptly backed down, a pregnant young woman went on a romantic getaway to Taiwan.
Poon Hiu-wing, 20, never returned to Hong Kong from that Valentine’s Day trip last year, but her boyfriend, Chan Tong-kai, 19, did. He would later tell the Hong Kong police that he had strangled her, stuffed her body in a suitcase and dumped it in a thicket of bushes near a subway station in Taipei.
It was just a local crime story at first, the details dribbling out in the tabloid press: a selfie of the couple on Facebook, grainy security camera footage, the circumstances of their last argument.
Then this past February, nearly a year after Mr. Chan’s arrest, the Hong Kong government cited the case to propose legislation that would allow the city to transfer criminal suspects to Taiwan and other places with which it lacks an extradition treaty — including mainland China.
Seizing on the sensational crime as Exhibit A in a rushed campaign to push through the measure, Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, and her superiors in the Chinese leadership seemed confident they had a winning strategy.
As it turned out, they badly underestimated public fear and suspicion of Beijing’s encroachment on this semiautonomous former British colony. The gambit provoked one of Hong Kong’s largest protests in decades while also revitalizing the territory’s beleaguered pro-democracy opposition.
In a rare retreat for President Xi Jinping’s hard-line government, Mrs. Lam finally yielded to the pressure on Saturday, suspending her push for the legislation while resisting demands to withdraw it completely and resign.
[Read about  protests on Sunday  where many are calling for a full withdrawal of the bill.]
From the start, critics labeled the extradition plan a “Trojan horse” that would allow Beijing to target political dissidents and others in Hong Kong who ran afoul of party officials.
As popular outrage spread, Mrs. Lam and her allies stuck to the script, arguing that Hong Kong needed the bill to bring Mr. Chan to justice — even after the authorities in Taiwan made clear that was not true. Taiwanese officials said as early as May that they would not seek Mr. Chan’s extradition under the proposed legislation.
Their objection echoed that of the people of Hong Kong: The courts and security forces in mainland China, all controlled by the ruling Communist Party, could not be trusted.
Mrs. Lam’s repeated invocation of the Poon family’s grief was seen as just “political opportunism at its worst,” said Dennis Kwok, an opposition lawmaker.
A Grisly Crime
Ms. Poon had enrolled in a school that offered cooking and beautician classes. Mr. Chan was studying business. They met in July 2017 while working part time at a shop.
Before the couple set off for Taiwan last year, she gushed on Facebook, “He said I am his first and last girlfriend.”
They spent Valentine’s Day together in Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, but two days later had a fight that stretched into the early morning.
Ms. Poon had bought a pink suitcase at one of Taipei’s famed night markets, and they argued about how their luggage should be packed, Mr. Chan would later tell investigators, according to The South China Morning Post.
Then, according to the account he provided the police, Ms. Poon revealed that an ex-boyfriend was the father of the child she was pregnant with, and showed Mr. Chan a video of her having sex with another man.
In a rage, Mr. Chan hit her head against a wall, struggled with her on the floor of their hotel room for about 10 minutes and strangled her, he said. He stuffed her body into a suitcase and went to sleep.
When Ms. Poon failed to return home, her father started a frantic search. Mr. Chan told him the couple had had an argument and “went our separate ways,” according to Taiwan News. The police in Hong Kong questioned Mr. Chan, and he told them the same.
But then the authorities in Taiwan pulled surveillance footage that showed Mr. Chan struggling to drag a pink suitcase out of their hotel.
Police detectives in Hong Kong questioned him again. This time, he confessed and disclosed the location of her body, a field near the Zhuwei train station on the northern outskirts of Taipei. The police found it that night.
But the Hong Kong police could not charge Mr. Chan with murder for a crime committed in Taiwan. Instead, he was held and eventually convicted on money laundering charges for using Ms. Poon’s credit cards after her death.
In April, a court in Hong Kong sentenced him to 29 months in prison. With time served while awaiting trial and good behavior, he could be released as soon as October.
An autopsy indicated Ms. Poon had been four to five months pregnant.
‘Trojan Horse’ or Justice?
Violent crime is relatively rare in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and the case received extensive coverage by local news outlets when Mr. Chan was first arrested.
Some reports noted it might be difficult to prosecute him on murder charges because of international red tape, but for months, there was no sign the case would be at the center of an international dispute.
Then, in December, prosecutors in Taiwan obtained an arrest warrant for Mr. Chan.
The government said it had reached out three times to the authorities in Hong Kong to discuss how he might be extradited. All three requests went unanswered, according to Chiu Chui-cheng, a deputy minister of Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, the agency responsible for policy toward China.
There were two interrelated problems: China does not recognize the government of Taiwan, which it considers part of its territory. And Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997, does not have an extradition agreement with Taiwan.
Two months later, just before the anniversary of Ms. Poon’s killing, Mrs. Lam made her move.
[Read more about Carrie Lam, a “good fighter” for the extradition bill.]
Her government submitted papers to Hong Kong’s Legislative Council that cited the killing in proposing legislation that would allow extraditions on a “case-by-case” basis to jurisdictions with which Hong Kong lacks a formal extradition agreement.
The plan covered Taiwan — but also mainland China. And that was a big deal.
Hong Kong had never allowed extraditions to mainland China before — a safeguard agreed upon when Britain returned the territory and Beijing promised it a high degree of autonomy. (The measure prohibits extradition to any part of China, which complicates any deal with Taiwan because of Beijing’s claim of sovereignty over the democratic, self-governing island.)
And yet Mrs. Lam sought to sidestep the legislature’s regular committee process and put the proposal on a fast track with an unusually short 20-day public review.
“The parents of the victim have not stopped writing letters to the government,” Mrs. Lam told reporters, according to Hong Kong Free Press. “There were five addressed to me. They were still writing this January. If you have read these letters from Mr. and Mrs. Poon, you would also feel that we must try to help them.”
She added, “If we act too carefully, and slowly consult society or issue consultation papers, then I am afraid we would not be able to help with this special case.”
Appearing at a news conference in February in sunglasses, a mask and a baseball hat, Ms. Poon’s mother urged action, too.
“I cannot sleep at night,” she said. “The only way I can help my daughter is to help her get justice.”
But the effort to focus discussion on Ms. Poon’s killing soon fell apart as critics raised an alarm about the introduction of extraditions to mainland China — and asked why a more limited arrangement could not be worked out for Taiwan alone or even just in Mr. Chan’s case.
Opposition built steadily. Thousands attended a protest against the measure in March, and in April, tens of thousands rallied against it outside the Legislative Council. Lawmakers arguing about the bill scuffled in the legislature; one was carried out on a stretcher.
Mrs. Lam, a career servant who was installed by Beijing in 2017, assured the public that the legislation would not apply to political crimes. But even within her insular council of advisers — like herself, unelected — there was unease. The territory’s top finance officials, for example, were dismayed when they learned the bill would also allow Beijing to begin requesting freezes on assets in Hong Kong.
Then in May, Taiwan dramatically undercut Mrs. Lam’s argument by declaring it would not seek Mr. Chan’s extradition even if the bill passed.
“Without the removal of threats to the personal safety of nationals going to or living in Hong Kong caused by being extradited to mainland China,” said Mr. Chiu, the deputy minister, “we will not agree to the case-by-case transfer proposed by the Hong Kong authorities.”
‘It Is the Right Thing to Do’
Mrs. Lam has said she decided to pursue the extradition law herself, without prodding from President Xi or other Chinese leaders. But China’s propaganda outlets took a hard line against the protesters, accusing them of conspiring with China’s enemies abroad, and several senior Communist Party officials in Beijing endorsed the legislation.
That helped transform the debate into a broader fight over the erosion of civil liberties under Chinese rule — and Hong Kong’s future as a global financial center.
For five years, since the failure of the Umbrella Movement demanding free elections, Hong Kong’s pro-democracy opposition had been on the defensive. But the extradition bill gave it a chance to rally the public against something easy to understand: the possibility of being arrested and sent to mainland China.
As many as a million people in a city of about 7.4 million marched against the legislation last weekend, one of the largest protests in Hong Kong’s history.
Even after the repudiation from Taiwan, Mrs. Lam continued to invoke Mr. Chan to defend the bill, acknowledging only that there would be “latent difficulties” extraditing him under the measure if it was passed.
“I continue to hold fast to the belief that it is the right thing to do,” she said in a televised interview on Wednesday, as tens of thousands of protesters surrounded the legislature and police officers forced them back with batons, tear gas and rubber bullets.
If the bill is not adopted, she added, addressing the victim’s parents by name, “I cannot promise you, Mr. and Mrs. Poon, that the criminal who murdered your daughter would get his punishment through the law.”
There was a whiff of desperation to the remarks, and as the opposition called on the public to take to the streets again this weekend, a few members of the pro-Beijing establishment in Hong Kong abandoned Mrs. Lam and called on her to postpone the legislation.
On Friday, she quietly traveled across the border to the mainland city of Shenzhen, where she consulted with senior Chinese officials. Some had flown in from Beijing, and a few of the party’s top experts on Hong Kong were there, too. (Mr. Xi was out of the country, celebrating his birthday with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at a regional summit meeting in Tajikistan.)
There was a consensus: Given the public’s reaction, Mrs. Lam should delay the legislation indefinitely.
Announcing the decision on Saturday, she raised Mr. Chan’s case again in defending the measure but finally acknowledged that Taiwan’s position meant there was no rush to pass it. “We will adopt the most sincere and humble attitude to accept criticisms and make improvements,” she said.
Mrs. Lam’s argument failed to resonate, in part because many believe Hong Kong can find a way to ensure Mr. Chan faces trial without opening the door to extraditions to the mainland.
China and Taiwan have for years sent criminal suspects to each other, for example, even though they do not formally recognize each other, and some lawmakers believe Hong Kong should establish a similar arrangement with Taiwan.
Doing so with Taiwan and not mainland China, however, would be politically challenging.
Julian Ku, a law professor at Hofstra University, said it would mean acknowledging that Taiwan’s courts are more trustworthy and fair to criminal defendants than China’s are.
“While this is undoubtedly true by almost every measurement,” he said, “it would be really embarrassing for the Hong Kong government to admit that truth.”

Joshua Wong and Alex Chow: The People of Hong Kong Will Not Be Cowed by China,"You can arrest us. But more protesters will keep coming out.
HONG KONG — “If we burn, you burn with us.” A famous line in the movie “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay”has been given a new life in Hong Kong’s summerlong protests: It has come to represent the spirit unleashed by hundreds of thousands of protesters. As many commentators have pointed out, the massive, leaderless resistance movement here is a critical front-line battle against the authoritarian Chinese Communist Party in Beijing. A dictatorial party facing domestic and global pressures — especially from the ongoing trade negotiations with the United States — the C.C.P. is getting impatient, apparently. On Friday, it targeted leading activists and politicians in Hong Kong with a round of arrests, possibly signaling that a broader crackdown may be around the corner.
That morning, while one of us, Joshua, was walking to the metro station, officers from the Hong Kong police snatched him and shoved him into a car. He was arrested on three charges related to a protest outside police headquarters on June 21. As Friday wore on, more activists, including two moderate pro-democracy lawmakers and an advocate of independence for Hong Kong, were arrested as well. The charges they face range from rioting and assaulting police officers, to inciting and participating in an unauthorized assembly, to damaging property and illegally entering the Legislature.
Even as the Chinese authorities try to intimidate protesters, they are using their vast propaganda machine to try to convince the public in China that foreign agents and local conspirators are inciting unrest in Hong Kong, hoping to create chaos.
Friday’s arrests mark another watershed moment in the fast-moving story of Hong Kong’s eroding freedoms. But so, too, does the protest on Saturday: Tens of thousands of people marched again for their rights, despite a police ban on any gatherings that day, braving arrests, tear gas and water cannons. The people of Hong Kong will not be cowed by the C.C.P.
On the very same day five years ago, the C.C.P. smashed Hong Kongers’ dream for electoral freedom by announcing that it would add more controls to the way the city’s leader, the chief executive, is nominated and elected. The Umbrella Movement was born out of that decision. This summer’s protest movement was born of the Hong Kong government’s push to hurriedly pass a bill that would have allowed the extradition of criminal suspects to China, at China’s request — a bill that would have sealed, right now, the death of the “one country, two systems” principle that is supposed to safeguard the city’s semi-autonomy until 2047.
Recent reporting reveals that a few weeks ago Chinese officials — very likely including President Xi Jinping himself — rejected a proposal by Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, to pacify the protesters. At the C.C.P.’s instruction, Reuters reports, Ms. Lam toughened her stance toward the demonstrators, squarely declining all five of their demands — including reforming the electoral system or appointing an independent commission to investigate police violence this summer. Just last week, she went even further, suggesting that the government could pass the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, a version of martial law.
The ongoing mass movement in Hong Kong is civil unrest all right — but civil unrest that is the doing of the C.C.P. The protesters are only defending their beloved city, a beacon of liberty, equality and human dignity. In the past months, young students, middle-aged professionals and the elderly have come together and dared to resist the rising Chinese empire. Risking their future, our fellow citizens have braved batons, tear gas, rubber bullets and even slashing by triad members. They did so again Saturday.
The Hong Kong police has repeatedly abused its powers, by way of excessive violence on the streets but also, it is reported, by maiming first-aid volunteers, sexually harassing female protesters under arrest or assaulting other people in their custody. The authorities are also intimidating big businesses.
Hong Kong’s youth are maturing quickly from breathing in the toxic air that is being shot at them. Many teenagers buy safety masks with their pocket money — and their convictions strengthened. While the elderly implore police officers to put down their pistols and batons, professionals are making donations to the movement.
Righting the wrong that is being done in Hong Kong is also the business of the outside world and rests on its will to confront a C.C.P.-controlled China. World leaders cannot keep mistaking their wish for the peaceful rise of China (and one that perhaps will eventually become democratic) with the reality of the Chinese Communist dictatorship today. Any act or policy that sustains the lifeblood of the Communist dictatorship in Beijing is an offense to the peoples whom that dictatorship persecutes and oppresses — in Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong and mainland China.
When Britain handed control of Hong Kong to China in 1997, some people thought that what was then a colony — a wartime trophy of European imperial empires — was about to come unshackled. But handing Hong Kong to a reviving empire only spelled its re-colonialization. If China had been a democracy in 1997, the handover would have meant no dispute. In reality, it turned the millions of Hong Kong’s residents into refugees in their own city, subservient to the authoritarian Communist regime in Beijing.
Many Hong Kongers are people, or descendants of people, who fled the mainland to escape a regime that starved tens of millions of its citizens decades ago, then murdered students in 1989 and has since persecuted political dissents incessantly. Today, that regime fuels Chinese nationalism on the mainland by delivering fragmented information and fabricated propaganda, or “fake news,” to its people.
We understand that some critics of American interventionism may be inclined to have sympathy for China as a still-developing country bullied by an over-dominant West. But please listen to us here in Hong Kong: Communist China is no alternative to the interventionism you hate or contest — that is an inconvenient truth that the world must reckon with.
The massive resistance movement in Hong Kong is a crisis of legitimacy for the Chinese government. The uprising is also a call for the rest of the world to support our crusade for human dignity, equality and freedom. The protesters at the front lines of these marches, who go out there in the city’s streets, are doing no less than taking on that enormously powerful communist-cum-fascist regime.
In September, the struggle will only take on more life. We know that the Chinese government wants grand celebrations for the 70th anniversary of the birth of the People’s Republic of China on Oct. 1; it wants to put history on its side by rewriting the memory of the people. But Hong Kongers won’t let it commemorate that day without a fight.
In the meantime, American legislators are supposed to vote on a bill, the Human Rights and Democracy Act, that would give the president of the United States power to penalize Chinese officials who interfere in Hong Kong’s affairs. The law could also allow the United States to revoke the special economic treatment that Hong Kong enjoys, as separate from the mainland.
If the United States Congress passes the bill, it will be delivering a firm message both to other silent allies of Hong Kong and to China’s dictators. The clock is ticking in Hong Kong. Our future is being determined now.

A Rush to the Street as Protesters Worldwide See Democracies Backsliding,"It seems that 2019 might be the year of the protest.
In Prague last week, Czechs gathered in the largest demonstration since the fall of the Iron Curtain to demand the resignation of their prime minister over corruption accusations.
Not two weeks earlier, around a million people demonstrated in Hong Kong against a law that would permit extradition to mainland China, forcing the government to back down.
In Kazakhstan, mass protests have led to thousands of arrests. And in Algeria, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika left office in April after protests; President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan followed a few days later.
The motives for each uprising are unique. But experts say there is reason to believe they are also manifestations of a global trend in which masses of ordinary citizens are demanding more accountability from those in power.
“Since about 2010, we have seen a seeming rise in mobilization among people who don’t normally mobilize,” said Helen Margetts, a professor at Oxford University and co-author of a book on social media and political protests. That includes “young people, people from ethnic minorities and people in authoritarian states,” she said.
One reason, research suggests, is that global political shifts have created increased expectations of democratic accountability — even in autocracies — at the same time that authoritarianism is on the rise around the world.
Those two trends are colliding, giving citizens more to object to just as they increasingly feel entitled to object. Also, rising distrust of political establishments is leaving many citizens wary, even in democracies, of relying on the ballot box alone. Instead, they are taking to the streets.
And because social media has made it far easier to mobilize public sentiment and organize mass action, thwarted expectations are quicker than ever to transform into large demonstrations — but perhaps more vulnerable than ever to falling apart before their goals are secured. That can create a self-reinforcing cycle of protest and instability.
Great Expectations
Since the end of the Cold War, “everyone has to claim to be a democracy,” said Milan Svolik, a Yale professor who studies democratization and democratic backsliding.
Even in autocracies, political trends in recent decades have “increased citizen expectations that governments should be accountable to their people in meaningful ways,” two democracy experts, Thomas Carothers and Richard Youngs, wrote in a 2015 report for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
But those increased expectations of accountability have not always matched reality. In many post-Soviet states, for instance, there was little incentive for leaders to reform police forces and other security institutions inherited from the Cold War days, said Erica Marat, a professor at the National Defense University who studies democracy and security in the former Soviet bloc.
The result is that some of those governments, and particularly their punitive, militarized security services, did not have mechanisms in place to meet the urban middle classes’ rising expectations of democratic accountability.
That led to protests across the region, Dr. Marat said, as people realized that joining demonstrations was one of the few avenues for making political demands.
“Mass collective action never comes out of nowhere,” she said. “There are always smaller actions against the repressive state.” These can then draw in others who are more likely to act once they see that there is public support.
In Kazakhstan, for instance, smaller protests were part of a “learning process,” Dr. Marat said, which evolved into a larger mobilization.
A similar pattern has played out in other regions as well.
In Hong Kong, although the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests brought large numbers of people to the streets to demand democracy, they ultimately failed to force systemic change. But, Dr. Marat believes, those demonstrations may have contributed to this month’s successful protests against the proposed extradition law.
In Sudan, there were major protests in 2018 against rising food prices, followed by a schism within Mr. al-Bashir’s own party in August over his plan to change the Constitution to run for president again. That led to a series of public protests against the government in the early months of this year, culminating in Mr. al-Bashir’s ouster in mid-April.
Populism and Backlash
The conflict between democratic expectations and rising authoritarianism is also driving protests within democracies.
Rising inequality, corruption scandals and frustration with seemingly unresponsive institutions have made the system feel less democratic to many citizens. That has led many to protest by voting in populists who promise to smash the flawed system and govern for the people.
But once in office, such leaders often crush dissent and dismantle checks and balances, concentrating power in their own hands and further exacerbating the conflict between democracy and authoritarianism. Now, that is helping drive more mass protests.
In Venezuela, for instance, Hugo Chávez was elected on a populist platform, but then he and his successor, Nicolás Maduro, stripped power from the legislature and packed the courts with allies. That left street protests as the main avenue for expressing dissent as the country suffered a catastrophic economic collapse.
In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, once an extremely popular elected leader, embraced authoritarian methods and oversaw the dismantling of much of Turkish democracy.
Turkey has not yet seen mass mobilizations like those in Hong Kong or Prague. But this week, after Mr. Erdogan’s chosen candidate for Istanbul mayor lost for a second time, thousands of people rallied in celebration — perhaps an implicit warning of what might happen if future elections are not given due deference.
Drawing on a multiyear data set called V-Dem, the political scientists Anna Lührmann and Staffan I. Lindberg concluded that since 1994, there has been a growing wave of “autocratization,” with 75 countries taking significant steps toward authoritarianism.
But even in countries where that has not happened, corruption by high-level officials, particularly if committed with seeming impunity, can stir unrest.
The recent protests in the Czech Republic came after the police recommended fraud charges against Prime Minister Andrej Babis, who was seen as manipulating the justice ministry to prevent such charges from being filed.
So far, Mr. Babis has refused to bow to protesters’ demands, insisting that he will continue working to make the Czech Republic “great again.”
The Danger of Success
Mass protest is a two-edged sword, and a rise in mass mobilizations may bring not an era of resurgent democracy but one of instability.
A more basic phenomenon may be at play in the rise of mass protest movements: Social media, by making it far easier to spread outrage and mobilize people, has made political uprisings subject to the law of large numbers. Simply put, as many more protests are attempted, Dr. Margetts said, the number that succeed will also rise.
But research by Zeynep Tufekci, a social scientist at the University of North Carolina, suggests protests driven by social media are especially fragile. Because they are decentralized, the movements can collapse or be co-opted more easily.
And the gains from even successful protests can be short-lived, particularly if the new government feels pressure to consolidate power quickly.
Protests succeed not just on their own strength but, in large part, by forcing a country’s governing elites to realign their priorities and loyalties — and by giving them an opening to do so. That realignment, however, does not always favor demonstrators.
In Sudan, for example, Mr. al-Bashir was forced out — but the general who consolidated power after him deployed troops against demonstrators. Dozens of people were killed, and many were brutalized. A similar story played out in Zimbabwe, where the 2017 ouster of the longtime dictator Robert Mugabe was followed by a violent crackdown.
“You can get people out on the street with social media,” Dr. Margetts said. “It’s the next part that’s tricky.”

Hong Kong Unrest: ‘We Cannot Give Up’,"As protests in Hong Kong increasingly escalate into violent clashes, demonstrators, government supporters and others reflect on where the movement is headed.
HONG KONG — Over the past nearly two months, hundreds of thousands of people have braved Hong Kong’s sweltering summer heat in a series of mass rallies against an unpopular bill that has come to symbolize concerns about the encroachment of the mainland Chinese government on their semiautonomous territory.
The city’s beleaguered leader, Carrie Lam, has already suspended the bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China and declared it “dead.” But she has refused to formally withdraw it or to meet the protesters’ other demands, which include the establishment of an independent commission to investigate police conduct and the right to directly elect the territory’s leader.
Mrs. Lam’s unwavering stance has helped fuel protests that now occur regularly, some of them escalating dramatically. In recent weeks, protesters have stormed the city’s legislative offices, clashed with riot police officers at a luxury shopping mall and surrounded the mainland Chinese government’s offices in Hong Kong.
[ For the second day in a row, thousands rallied against mob violence and what they call brutality by the police .]
We spoke to protesters as well as pro-establishment activists and others who have been otherwise caught in the crossfire, to hear about their experiences. These are excerpts from their answers, edited for clarity and length:
Henry Fung, 17
A high schooler and antigovernment protester who believes forceful tactics are needed
I haven’t really protested before, not even in marches, but I feel that if I don’t do something to protect freedoms I ought to have, I may never recover them again. We want to be peaceful, but under oppression, we need to resist.
We do what peaceful protesters don’t dare to do. Only after we’ve occupied a street or a building do they feel that it’s safe to come out and sit there as well. When I walk to the front, I’m scared. I prepare myself mentally that I may get hurt and even arrested.
My brother supports me, but he can’t join the protests because of work. My father found out because my school called him when I skipped exams on June 12. He would say that it’s dangerous, and that protesters who are in front, hitting the police, are rioters, and to tell me not to be like them. I feel that that’s unfair to them, but I wouldn’t get angry at him.
Alexandra Wong, 63
Retiree who is often on the front lines of protests, waving a Union Jack flag
I wave the British flag because I want to remind middle-aged and older people to think back on 1997 (when Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese control), and what the British people have built for us. The Hong Kong government and Communist regime keep wanting to erode our freedoms, our partial democracy, core values and our rule of law.
I didn’t study politics or social science, but I simply understand how precious democracy is from life experience. I lived in Austria for 12 and a half years. I’ve lived in mainland China and was born and raised in Hong Kong, and have also been an immigrant in the United States. The difference in political systems can alter the people’s sense of happiness so vastly — like heaven and earth!
I need to stand at the front with the students. I want to resist till the end with them.

A cook who was in the town of Yuen Long on July 21 when  a mob attacked protesters  and bystanders
It was 9:45 p.m., and I had gotten off work and was walking along a river on my way home. I saw many people in white shirts holding weapons and I said, “Wow! So many people in white.” Those people came over and yelled at me right after I said that. One person started to hit me, then a few more. Then they all started to hit me as I walked further. There must have been around 20 people surrounding me.
These people beat me with things like rattan or hiking sticks. I couldn’t exactly see what they were using, but I saw other people holding these weapons. I felt frightened and bewildered. There was no way I looked like their target. I didn’t go to the protest.
No one helped me. During the attack, someone threw my mobile phone into the river. I just ran away and found a convenience store where I called emergency services. Some officers arrived and an ambulance took me to a hospital.
Perry Dino, 53
Artist (real name: Perry Chan) who captures the protests with oil on canvas, even when tear gas is fired
I see my role as a witness to history, not so different from reporters. I’m here to stand with the students, rain or shine. People can take thousands of photos at a protest, but I only create one painting. Photos can be deleted but to destroy my paintings, you will have to burn them.
As I was painting on site, a foreigner asked me to sell him my painting but I told him no. I’m worried that if a painting passes through the wrong hands, it could disappear from history. I think they need to stay here so that the next generation can see it in an exhibit about Hong Kong’s democracy.
Not many paintings have tear gas as a raw material.
Lam Ching, 28
An instructor at an adventure camp who volunteers medical assistance at protests
Too many people had been injured in recent clashes between police and protesters, so I decided to come out, hoping to do my part and provide them with first aid treatment.
I feel so angry. It is supposed to be a political issue, but the government has turned it into a conflict between the police and Hong Kong people.
We are all Hong Kong people. I really hope the Hong Kong police force can remain professional. I genuinely hope they can regain their rationality and self-possession.
So Hiu-ching, 16
High school student and peaceful protester
Our society isn’t thrown into chaos because of the protests. There are protests because society is in turmoil. I really want to ask the government to think about what they did this for. So much has happened and so many young people’s hopes have been dashed. Can they take responsibility? Why can’t you say you will withdraw the bill?
My parents sometimes cry while watching broadcasts of the protests and would tell us, “We are very sorry.” I don’t want to repeat this phrase to my children. I want to fight for a Hong Kong that we want, and not have to tell generation after generation that we haven’t done enough. I’m very happy my parents understand this.
There are still some conflicts though. Sometimes they would say things like, “How can you battle with the government? You are doing so much, will it lead to anything?” But we cannot give up because we won’t win without even trying.
He Hua, 42
A Mandarin teacher from mainland China and a government supporter
I love Hong Kong. I don’t want it to be negatively impacted. My child goes to school in Hong Kong, I work in Hong Kong, I love Hong Kong, simple as that.
I am here to support the police, and we have to hold up our flag because we are one collective organization.
It’s not that other people don’t love Hong Kong. Perhaps they don’t understand or have misunderstood, and will do many rather impulsive things. The protesters have damaged roads and the Legislative Council, which is very poor behavior. As Chinese people, we must not do that. We need to be people of conscience and morals.

"Beijing Is Treading Lightly in Hong Kong, for Now","The throngs packing the urban canyons of Hong Kong have posed a fateful dilemma before the most powerful man in Asia: Back down before people power, anathema to any authoritarian leader and certainly to Xi Jinping, or do whatever it takes to bring Hong Kong to heel, risking the censure of the free world and undermining a hub of global commerce vital to China itself.
The tension has been inherent in the “one country, two systems” policy since Britain handed Hong Kong back to China 22 years ago, creating a standing contrast between an authoritarian behemoth claiming that Western liberties are unnecessary and incompatible with Chinese ways, and a prosperous and rollicking enclave that thrives under those same liberties.
Almost from the outset, China’s ruling Communist Party has tried to chip away at the relative autonomy of Hong Kong, and a majority of Hong Kong’s 7.4 million residents have steadfastly responded with peaceful but powerful protests. The anniversary of the 1997 handover, on July 1, is marked annually with street marches, which grew to vast dimensions in 2003 and 2004 to protest legislation Hong Kongers perceived as a threat to their ways. In 2014, changes giving China more control over Hong Kong’s electoral system led to the 79-day occupation of the city center that came to be known as the Umbrella Movement.
The current protests, which began in opposition to a proposed law that would allow extradition to the mainland, have taken the confrontation to new levels. There is the sheer size of the demonstrations, around a million on June 9 and close to two million a week later, according to the estimates of the organizers (numbers from the police were far lower and far less credible), including huge numbers of young people who would have no memory of pre-1997 Hong Kong.
Then there is the stunning rejection, proclaimed by Sunday’s outpouring of people, of the olive branch proffered by the authorities. The suspension of the extradition measure by Carrie Lam, the Beijing-backed chief executive of Hong Kong, and her highly unusual apology on Sunday amounted to a humiliating about-face in response to the protests.
To the Hong Kong people, however, it was no more than a tactical retreat. They demanded a full withdrawal rather than suspension of the proposed extradition law, an investigation into police tactics and official recognition that their demonstrations were not “riots,” a designation carrying criminal implications.
In effect, they demanded unconditional surrender. And that’s not in Mr. Xi’s playbook.
China’s secretive politics leave unclear the degree to which Mr. Xi is personally invested in the latest confrontation with Hong Kong. He was celebrating his 66th birthday with Vladimir Putin in Tajikistan when Mrs. Lam retreated, and she insists the law was her initiative to begin with. But there can be little question that the Chinese leadership gave Mrs. Lam the nod before she backed down, and none that the confrontation poses a grave challenge to Mr. Xi.
Mr. Xi’s nearly seven years in office have been marked by a steady tightening of his grip on power and a hard-line stance against any concessions to democratic demands. Shortly after ascending to power in 2012, Mr. Xi issued what have come to be known as the “seven unmentionables,” a list of values that were to be combated by the Communist Party. They include “Western constitutional democracy,” human rights, media independence, civil participation, pro-market liberalism and “nihilist” criticism of the party’s past.
These unmentionables are broadly the values that millions of Hong Kongers cherish, making of their enclave a direct challenge to Mr. Xi’s ideology and his scripted narrative that China’s rise is a phenomenon in which democracy and the rule of law are specious Western concepts with no relevance for China, and dissidents are a tiny minority manipulated by foreigners.
Now that a tactical retreat has not worked, the Chinese government has some tough calls to make. More concessions could further embolden the protesters. But a direct assault on Hong Kong’s civil liberties would be far more difficult and costly than, say, suppressing the Uighur minority in their remote Xinjiang region in northwestern China. Hong Kong’s history as a commercial center, its proximity to the enormous Chinese market and its rule of law have made it a global financial hub, with a multinational population to match. If the many businesses headquartered in Hong Kong were to flee a Chinese crackdown on freedoms, China would suffer a blow both to its economy and to its claims of Asian and global leadership.
Mr. Xi has stayed mostly silent on the events in Hong Kong, and however painful he may find it, it is in his best interests to give the protesters their victory. Under the Sino-British Joint Declaration signed in 1984 (evidently without any awareness of the warning implied in that date), Hong Kong is to retain its way of life and its freedoms until 2047. And if the continuing protests have made anything clear, it is that Hong Kongers will resist any efforts to move up the clock.

"When the Choreographer Won’t Fly, the Dancers Rehearse by Skype","Jérôme Bel has decided, for ecological reasons, not to work in any way that involves a plane ride. That can make things difficult.
PARIS — “Can you see me? Can you hear me?”
It was 6 p.m. in Paris and midday in New York, and Jérôme Bel was peering intently at the computer screen on his kitchen table.
The dancer Catherine Gallant suddenly appeared in the Skype window. “We’re on Governors Island. Shall I show you the view?” she said. Mr. Bel, who is often described as an experimental choreographer, groaned theatrically and said, “I wish I could be there.”
But it was Mr. Bel’s decision not to be in the rehearsal room in New York, where Ms. Gallant was about to run through “Isadora,” his new solo about the modern-dance pioneer Isadora Duncan. He will not be at Ms. Gallant’s performance on Wednesday at the Crossing the Line festival, nor at any other performance of the work in North America. That’s because Mr. Bel decided this year, for ecological reasons, that he would not work in any way that involves flying.
It was a tough decision. Like most successful performing artists, Mr. Bel depends on an international touring circuit. But at a moment of growing youth protests about climate change and increasing consciousness about greenhouse gas emissions from air travel, he feels no other choice is possible, he said.
“My career is really international, not national,” Mr. Bel said after the rehearsal, speaking in rapid French that was punctuated by eyebrow-lifting and gesticulations: “I don’t know whether I’ll be able to hang in there.” (Expressive shrug.) “If not, too bad.” (Flourish of hands.) “I’ll go and live in the country and teach dance to children.”
Meanwhile, he is reinventing his professional life, one project at a time. The decision to quit flying came in February, he said, after it dawned on him that, while he was in Paris, assistants had flown to both Hong Kong and Peru to stage his works. “I realized that I was lying to myself, trying not to use too much heating, eating organic food, but being a hypocrite, because my work contributes to the ecological crisis,” he said. “I made the decision that I would no longer be part of this artistic jet set.”
Initially, Mr. Bel thought this would mean the end of his career. His two full-time assistants, whose job is to coordinate and plan his tours, were horrified. But several projects were already in the works, including the Duncan solo, which Mr. Bel had begun creating with the French dancer, Elizabeth Schwartz, with the intention of touring the United States.
So she could avoid flying there, Ms. Schwartz suggested he contact Ms. Gallant, a fellow Duncan specialist based in New York. Mr. Bel and Ms. Gallant decided to try working via Skype. Over several sessions, they worked on changing and adapting the existing text that frames and contextualizes the Duncan dances Ms. Gallant performs in the show.
Before the run-through of the solo in the Governors Island studio, Ms. Gallant tested how far left and right she could move before being cut out of Mr. Bel’s view. As she danced, the screen froze several times, and Amelia Dawe Sanders, Ms. Gallant’s assistant, had to repeatedly log onto the Wi-Fi, which kept disconnecting, and adjust the microphone.
Mr. Bel remained calm throughout, making notes while waiting for the Skype session to reconnect. “Of course it is difficult and unsatisfactory,” he said later. “It’s like being visually impaired and hard of hearing. But this is a price I am willing to pay.”
On the other end, Ms. Gallant was more anxious. The interruptions were disappointing, she said, because it was important for her to be able to perform the solo right through. “You’re really just crossing your fingers,” she added.
“It’s not the same as being in a room together, especially generationally, for someone like me,” said Ms. Gallant, 63. “But I realize that this opportunity exists for me because of what Jérôme decided.”
Mr. Bel is not the only internationally successful artist with an anti-flying stance. The Berlin-based performance artist Tino Sehgal refuses to travel by plane, as does the British theater director Katie Mitchell. (There are even fewer cultural institutions with this policy; the Helsingborg Concert Hall in Sweden is a rare example.)
“It reduces the scope of where I can work,” Ms. Mitchell said in a telephone interview.
“I have been reflecting on, and wondering, whether Skype will evolve, whether our understanding of how we make things will evolve,” she said. If more artists used the video platform this way, she added, “it would open up a whole range of possibilities about how we make work and can use technology.”
For some, however, the difficulties are greater. In a telephone interview, the Belgian choreographer Anne-Teresa de Keersmaeker, who leads the dance company Rosas, called Mr. Bel’s decision “very courageous.” But, she added, “his practice is very different to what we do; when you work with highly skilled dancers performing the specific writing of a choreographer, you can’t transmit that by Skype.”
And, transmission isn’t the only issue. “Let’s not be naïve: Our performance practice is part of the mechanics of a capitalist market,” Ms. de Keersmaeker said. Even her recent decision to have Rosas travel only by train in Europe, increases travel costs and takes more time, she said. “We will ask the people who invite us to share the expense,” she said. “Will they be willing?”
Mr. Bel said he had persuaded theaters for upcoming tours to allow train trips; in the fall of 2020, he is to go to by train to Moscow and his assistants to four cities in China. He said these questions had forced him to interact with theater directors and presenters in a new way. “You have to explain that for 40 hours of train, you need to tour the country, go to more than one city.”
It’s not just his own travel, but the carbon footprint of the arts internationally, which preoccupies Mr. Bel. “If you won’t buy tomatoes that don’t come from France, or wherever you live, why do we watch culture that is flown in from other countries?” he said.
Courtney Geraghty, the artistic director of the Crossing the Line festival, said that it was important to awaken peoples’s consciences about environmental issues, but also important to show work from abroad. “In countries where there is nationalism and protectionism,” she said, audiences need “cross-cultural dialogue and international voices.”
Mr. Bel acknowledged that his decision was radical, and that his choice was not available to all. “Everyone intelligent and sensitive to this cause must invent their own solutions,” he said. “But our work in contemporary art is to change things.” (Huge swirl of arms.) “We must change this.”

Hong Kong Has Nothing Left to Lose,"HONG KONG — After breaking into Hong Kong’s legislature, protesters left a message for Carrie Lam, the city’s top government official, spray-painted on a pillar: “It was you who taught me that peaceful protests are futile.”
To the young activists, the storming of the Legislative Council was an act of desperation. Three times in the past month, tremendous numbers of Hong Kongers — at one point estimated to be more than two million — marched peacefully to protest against a controversial extradition bill with China, which they fear would undermine Hong Kong’s judiciary and its freedom. The government suspended but did not withdraw the law. It did not even meet representatives of those who marched.
I was among the journalists covering the break-in of the building, and I watched as protesters ripped metal bars from the side of the building to smash their way through the windows. Their actions seemed like a breathtaking act of defilement of one of Hong Kong’s institutions.
Yet on closer inspection, I saw that they had zeroed in on certain totems of power. Inside the legislative chamber, someone had blacked out Hong Kong’s emblem — a white bauhinia flower on a red background. They had torn up the Basic Law, effectively Hong Kong’s constitution, on the rostrum. Above it, someone had spray-painted over the words “The People’s Republic of China” in black. There were other graffiti messages on the walls, including, “There are no rioters, only tyranny,” a reference to the government’s announcement that an earlier demonstration, broken up by police firing rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets, constituted “a riot.” But certain parts of the building, like the library, were left untouched. Notes reminded protesters not to damage fragile items such as vases on display. Protesters even left money in the fridge to pay for the soda they drank.
Ms. Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, has vowed to pursue the offenders and condemned their “extreme use of violence.” Beijing criticized their “atrocities.” But this break-in had a clear purpose: It is a collective roar of rage against a government that has failed, by design, to represent the people. The Legislative Assembly’s composition apportions half its seats to business-friendly “functional constituencies,” ensuring that pro-government, pro-Beijing forces are in the majority, regardless of the results of legislative elections.
When those polls don’t produce the representatives Beijing wants, it has used the tools at its disposal to create a more pliant legislature. This happened after the 2016 elections, when a new crop of radical pro-democracy politicians was elected. Beijing then intervened to reinterpret Hong Kong’s Basic Law, retroactively disqualifying six popularly elected politicians over the way in which they took their oaths.
When it comes to Hong Kong politics, it isn’t just that the playing field is tilted. The rules of the game, even the point of the game, are constantly being redrawn. By vandalizing the legislature, protesters have aimed their anger not just at one law but at an entire system that has disenfranchised them.
The vandalism may have alienated many moderates who had previously backed the movement. But I saw large crowds outside the building, who supported the aims of the protesters. They were not firebrands, but students, social workers and physiotherapists who felt there was nothing left for them to lose.
That sense of impotence has been stoked by the failure of the Umbrella Movement in 2014, which sought freer elections but won no concessions after peacefully occupying key thoroughfares for more than two months. One young college student said bitterly: “The Umbrella movement was a big joke. Two months. Nothing gained. So that’s why Hong Kong people are gradually thinking we need to level up our actions.” As news emerged that the police would move in to the building, a young woman protected only by a paper face mask insisted she would stay on to bear witness. “We are scared,” she said. “But we’re more scared that we’ll lose our freedom.”
The protesters left around midnight, and police used tear gas to clear the streets, which had been occupied by some of the tens of thousands who had marched over the course of the day. Many questioned the role of the police: They had been in the Legco building but had suddenly disappeared, allowing protesters the chance to break in. Many suspected the retreat was a deliberate strategy to provide the government with justification to crack down on a “violent” movement. At a surreal 4 a.m. news conference, Ms. Lam, flanked by her unpopular police chief and secretary for security, did nothing to quell the suspicion.
Throughout this hot summer of civil disobedience, Hong Kong’s leaders have been astonishingly tone-deaf. The image of Ms. Lam toasting with champagne glasses at an official 22nd anniversary celebration of Hong Kong’s return to China enraged protesters. She watched the official flag-raising ceremony — accompanied by two hated former chief executives — on a closed circuit television inside a convention center that had been surrounded by rings of security. Outside, protesters held their own ceremony, raising to half-staff a flag depicting a blackened, dying bauhinia.
No one knows what will come next. The protest movement could subside or split into moderate and radical camps. Or the escalating cycles of violence, followed by tear gas, could become commonplace. Much now depends on whether the government will respond to the voices on the street with action. The turmoil is already damaging Hong Kong’s institutions, its international reputation and its desirability as a home. That fear was voiced on another banner, suspended on a wall on the other side of the legislative building, which read, “If we burn, you burn with us.”

"In Battle for Hong Kong, the Field Has Tilted Toward Beijing","HONG KONG — An attempt by Beijing’s hand-selected chief executive in Hong Kong to push through a bill seen as a threat to civil liberties. A defiant crowd of hundreds of thousands marching against it. The deployment of the police to keep demonstrators out of the legislature.
It has been a tumultuous few days for Hong Kong. On Wednesday, the police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at a huge throng of protesters who forced lawmakers to postpone a debate on legislation to allow extraditions to mainland China — a measure Hong Kong residents fear would subject them to the Communist Party’s whims.
The legislation is being championed by Hong Kong’s current leader, Carrie Lam, a lifetime civil servant chosen two years ago by Beijing to head the territory. On Wednesday, she compared the protesters to spoiled children and vowed to keep fighting for the extradition law.
In standing firm, she is channeling the hard-line instincts of her boss, the Communist Party leader Xi Jinping, who has presided over a clampdown on civil society across China and essentially silenced all visible political dissent on the mainland.
Ms. Lam’s position illustrates how far the relationship between Hong Kong and mainland China has tilted toward Beijing in recent years. If she succeeds in riding out the protests and passing the extradition bill, Beijing would get an opening to extend its authority over residents and visitors in the semi-autonomous territory with fewer safeguards than in Hong Kong’s independent courts — potentially chipping away at Hong Kong’s unique position as a center of global finance.
The battle over extradition is unfolding against the backdrop of an intensifying geopolitical competition between China and the United States, fanning longstanding fears among Chinese hard-liners that hostile foreign forces are using Hong Kong as a base of subversion against the mainland.
Beijing has not been shy about its support for Ms. Lam’s plan, which would allow the government to extradite people to the mainland for the first time, with few safeguards. Many in Hong Kong worry that Communist officials will use it to seize political dissidents and others who run afoul of the party, for trial on bogus charges. A protest on Sunday drew as many as a million people, or one in seven residents of the territory.
Hong Kong has been through similar upheaval before. In the summer of 2003, its first chief executive, a shipping tycoon named Tung Chee-hwa, tried to pass stringent security legislation that China’s Communist leadership had insisted the former British colony adopt.
Back then, Mr. Tung and his superiors in Beijing retreated in the face of similar mass protests and quickly defused public anger.
But Ms. Lam has taken a very different stance, and if the extradition law passes — as many expect — it could create the basis for a renewed push to enact the national security legislation, known as Article 23, that failed in 2003.
That legislation — against sedition, subversion, secession and treason — would have allowed the authorities to conduct warrantless searches and shut down newspapers. It has long been a top priority for the Communist Party, and its passage would be an important political triumph for Mr. Xi, who could claim an achievement that eluded his predecessors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao.
Beijing has become much more willing to intervene openly in Hong Kong politics in recent years, and in several important ways the differences between now and 2003 go beyond Mr. Xi alone.
Beijing’s supporters now hold a larger majority in Hong Kong’s Legislative Council — 43 of 70 seats — than they did in 2003. Their camp consists mostly of professional politicians, rather than the patrician tycoons who once dominated the legislature. The tycoons had showed more independence, even if they generally sided with the government against the pro-democracy opposition.
In 2003, the attempt to push through the national security legislation collapsed when one of those tycoons, James Tien, grew alarmed by mass demonstrations. His pro-business political party withdrew its support for the bill, depriving the legislation of a majority.
But that is much less likely to happen with the class of lawmakers in office now. Some are far less affluent and more dependent on their $151,600 government salaries and generous expense accounts.
“They are all yes-men,” Mr. Tien said in an interview Wednesday of his successors in the legislature. “The reason they are yes-men is the last 15 years have seen a gradual shift to more Chinese influence.”
In Hong Kong’s hybrid political system — a result of British colonial tradition as much as Communist control — only half the seats in the legislature are filled by popular elections. Most of the other half of the seats are filled by industry and business groups, and China’s booming economy means Beijing enjoys greater leverage over the Hong Kong economy now than it did even a decade ago, especially in finance.
Ms. Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, was chosen by Beijing after she had tried to serve as a conciliator during the pro-democracy demonstrations that shut down parts of Hong Kong for months in 2014, known as the Umbrella Movement. At the time, she was the government’s second-highest official.
But democracy advocates’ hopes that she would steer a middle course between Beijing’s demands and public demands for greater political pluralism were quickly dashed, as Ms. Lam has shown little willingness to compromise on central issues.
She argues that the extradition bill is needed to close a loophole that has allowed criminals to escape justice by seeking refuge in the territory. Two of the seven members of China’s governing Politburo Standing Committee — Wang Yang and Han Zheng — have called for it to be approved.
It is the first time since Hong Kong’s return to Chinese rule in 1997 that two members of the committee have spoken out on a Hong Kong issue. Three minister-level officials in the central government have also endorsed the legislation.
In the past, senior Chinese leaders had been more restrained because of Beijing’s promise to grant the territory “a high degree of autonomy.”
In 2003, Mr. Tien flew to Beijing after a half million people marched against the national security legislation and met with Liao Hui, then the minister in charge of Hong Kong and Macau affairs. They had a cordial conversation, with Mr. Liao only hinting at his views, and Mr. Tien returned to Hong Kong under the mistaken impression that Mr. Liao had given him freedom to decide how he and his party would vote.
“Sometimes we might be too gentlemanly and not make our points too clearly,” Mr. Tien said on Wednesday, sitting in his suede-walled boardroom overlooking Victoria Harbor. “I thought I convinced him how serious the matter is, and he was nodding his head.”
That kind of “cultural misunderstanding between the Hong Kong Chinese and the mainland Chinese is one of the issues that has not allowed us to build trust,” said Christine Loh, a former lawmaker and under secretary of the environment.
Beijing is more direct now. Its officials regularly summon local politicians and business leaders to meetings at the Communist Party’s local headquarters, a skyscraper that, with a silvery, four-story observation sphere at the top, looks like something out of a Batman film.
Mr. Xi has not commented publicly on the legislation, and there is some debate in Hong Kong about what he thinks of the tense situation in the territory. As television stations broadcast live coverage of the police battling protesters in Hong Kong on Wednesday, state television in Beijing led the evening news with Mr. Xi’s official trip to neighboring Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.
Beijing’s allies in Hong Kong say that Ms. Lam, not Beijing, proposed the extradition bill and has driven it forward. She has portrayed it as her response to a case involving a Hong Kong man accused of killing his girlfriend on a trip to Taiwan. (Officials in Taiwan, though, have objected to the legislation and said they would not seek the man’s extradition if it passes.)
Ms. Lam is widely criticized not only by the pro-democracy opposition in Hong Kong but also, more quietly, by pro-Beijing politicians. They say she misread public opinion, mismanaged the issue and provoked a political crisis that has damaged the city’s international standing.
At this point, though, it would be difficult for Beijing to retreat without losing Ms. Lam. All three of Ms. Lam’s predecessors as chief executive under Chinese rule have left office under a shadow, with none completing a second term. Beijing has no enthusiasm for the acrimonious selection process that would be likely from yet another resignation.
Mr. Tien, whose change of heart doomed the national security bill in 2003, said the extradition plan could cause much bigger problems for Hong Kong businesses than the earlier legislation. But he said he did not want to fight Beijing at a time when the United States appears to him to be trying aggressively to block China’s rise.
“On China versus America, I am on China’s side; on President Trump versus President Xi, I’m on President Xi’s side,” he said.
Chinese propaganda outlets accuse opponents of the bill of colluding with hostile foreign forces. Pro-Beijing politicians point to trips by local democracy leaders to Washington this spring to meet Vice President Mike Pence and State Department officials.
Mr. Tien predicted that the legislature would pass the law next week, and said that he and other business leaders now just want to prevent it from being abused.
The government also prevailed five years ago, when huge crowds of demonstrators paralyzed swathes of Hong Kong while demanding free elections to choose the territory’s next chief executive. The government refused to concede, and after waiting two months, the police dispersed remaining protesters.
The extradition legislation, though, has galvanized the public in a different way. Many residents see it as a government attempt, as in 2003, to strip them of rights they have long enjoyed and put them at greater risk of arrest.
“We have no democracy,” said Emily Lau, a former lawmaker and chairwoman of the city’s Democratic Party, “but enjoy a level of personal freedom and rule of law and an independent judiciary, and we do not want them taken away.”

Japan Cites ‘National Security’ in Free Trade Crackdown. Sound Familiar?,"Last month, before an audience of world leaders, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan forcefully defended the global trade order that President Trump has so dramatically fractured.
“A free and open economy,” he told leaders of the Group of 20 nations in Osaka, Japan, “is the foundation of global peace and prosperity.”
Two days later, Mr. Abe became the latest world leader to strike a blow against free trade, when he moved to limit South Korea’s access to Japanese chemicals that are essential to its vast electronics industry, citing vague and unspecified concerns about national security. In doing so, Japan joined the United States, Russia and other countries that have used national security concerns as a justification for cutting off trade.
Once rarely invoked by world leaders, such arguments are wearing away at long-established global rules intended to keep trade disputes from spiraling out of control. Once they are weakened, experts say, damaging trade wars could become more common.
“If this is used too often, there’s a real potential to absolutely destroy the entire international trading system,” said Bryan Mercurio, an expert on international trade law at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
“If not one or two or three but 10 or 15 countries decide they’re going to take measures, really unilateral measures, based on some ill-defined national security exception, it devalues the rules.”
Japanese officials have said some South Korean companies have inadequately managed the chemicals, which fall under the category of “controlled items” — goods with potential military applications. The officials have not named companies or said how supplies may have been mismanaged.
South Korean officials suspect a different motive: retaliation over an escalating political dispute between the two countries concerning reparations for Japan’s World War II-era conduct. To some, Mr. Abe’s move seemed to take a page from Mr. Trump’s playbook, turning trade into a cudgel.
“The really troubling thing about it is that it represents the increasing weaponization of these trade or economic interests to coerce another country over completely unrelated issues,” said Gene Park, an expert on international political economy and Japanese politics at Loyola Marymount University.
“Japan has a lot of legitimate grievances,” he said, but trade measures are “not the right way to address them.”
South Korea on Friday called on the United Nations to investigate Japan’s claims. “If the investigation concludes that our government has done nothing wrong, Japan should immediately withdraw its retaliatory export restrictions,” Kim You-geun, a senior South Korean national security official, said at a news briefing. “Of course, there should be a thorough investigation into whether Japan is violating the rules as well.”
Japan’s move is the latest challenge to the global trade rules that have underpinned decades of commerce and economic growth.
Countries began setting the rules in the aftermath of World War II, hoping to avoid a repeat of the trade wars that had worsened the Great Depression. But they carved out exceptions, including for restrictions imposed in the name of national security.
For years, governments have been reluctant to use that exception because the idea of “national security” is open to broad interpretation that makes it ripe for abuse.
“If we just all point to national security, there’s a potential for all of the rules to fall apart,” said Tania Voon, an expert on international trade law at the University of Melbourne in Australia. She added that “it’s pretty easy to see how almost anything might be related” to national security.
Now more countries are citing the exception.
Mr. Trump has mixed national security and economic priorities as he has escalated his attacks on major trading partners, allowing him to label European and Japanese cars as national security threats and use the threat of tariffs to force Mexico into tightening its stance against illegal immigration into the United States. Russia cited national security when imposing traffic restrictions in and out of Ukraine. Last year, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates also cited national security to justify a blockade against Qatar.
The World Trade Organization, the global trading referee, is grappling with the issue. In April, it ruled in Russia’s favor over the Ukraine restrictions. The United States sided with Russia in that dispute, though the W.T.O. rejected the American argument that a country’s definition of national security is not subject to review by the group.
China has long combined its economic and political priorities, using trade as a weapon in recent years in territorial disputes with Japan and the Philippines and to protest South Korea’s installation of an antimissile system.
Nevertheless, “I would be very surprised if Japan would have done this without the U.S. doing it in the very recent past,” said Mr. Mercurio of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
If it lasts, Japan’s clash with South Korea could add one more pressure point to global growth. It could also require global technology companies to scramble for the microchips and other parts they need to make everyday gadgets.
“The Japanese have really muddied the water by characterizing the export restrictions as a security move,” said Daniel Sneider, who studies the Japan-South Korea relationship at Stanford University. “Now, what do you do if the South Koreans are unwilling to back off?”
Japanese officials said on July 1 that they would restrict exports of specialized chemicals — fluorinated polyimide, resists and hydrogen fluoride — needed in the production of semiconductors as well as smartphone and television screens. South Korea depends on Japan for much of its supply.
To continue to sell to South Korean customers, Japanese exporters will need to apply for licenses for each one, a process that can take up to 90 days. Additionally, Japan has indicated it may remove South Korea from a list of countries that are exempt from licensing requirements for exports with possible military applications.
While at least one of the chemicals could be used to make weapons, South Korean officials accuse Japan of limiting supplies for an unrelated reason: disagreements over Japan’s colonization of the Korean Peninsula in the lead-up to the Second World War.
The long-simmering issue took new life after South Korea’s Supreme Court ordered a Japanese company to pay compensation to a man who had been forced to work in one of its steel mills during the war. When the company refused, the court ordered the seizure of some of its South Korean assets.
Japan says that case and others were covered by a 1965 pact that declared claims from that era “settled completely and finally.”
“Everyone on both sides of the confrontation clearly knows that this is about the settlement,” said Bong Young-shik, an expert on Korean politics at Yonsei University.
Tensions had already been worsening. In November, South Korea said it would dissolve an agreement with Japan intended to settle the issue of women forced to work in Japanese wartime brothels. Relations soured further in December after Tokyo accused a South Korean warship of locking its radar on a Japanese patrol plane. Still, economic relations had remained stable.
The export limits appear calculated to force big South Korean chip makers like Samsung Electronics to pressure South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, to resolve the claims, said Mr. Sneider, of Stanford. If so, the move may have backfired. South Korean business leaders have rallied around Mr. Moon. South Korea challenged the move before the W.T.O. on Tuesday.
South Korean companies are looking for new suppliers for the chemicals, fearing that Japan could cut off exports entirely, according to Akira Minamikawa, an analyst at IHS Markit. For now, manufacturers have enough stockpiles to meet demand, which has weakened in Europe and China. The main impact will be on the production of high-tech products like advanced non-memory chips and flexible screens that are not yet being produced on a large scale, according to Sanjeev Rana, an analyst at CLSA, a brokerage.
“This issue is a little bit of noise,” Mr. Rana said. “Japan is just trying to make a point.”
Still, he said, there is widespread concern about the possible consequences.
“People are asking, ‘Is this really a one-off thing?’” Mr. Rana said. “‘Or is it the start of something bigger?’”

Waning of American Power? Trump Struggles With an Asia in Crisis,"The Trump administration has taken a hands-off approach to conflicts — from Kashmir to Hong Kong to the rivalry between Japan and South Korea — as Asian officials escalate the battles.
WASHINGTON — For two and a half years, President Trump has said he is finally doing in Asia what he asserts his predecessor, Barack Obama, failed to achieve with a strategic pivot: strengthen American influence and rally partners to push back against China.
But as violence escalates and old animosities are rekindled across Asia, Washington has chosen inaction, and governments are ignoring the Trump administration’s mild admonitions and calls for calm. Whether it is the internal battles in India and Hong Kong or the rivalry between two American allies, Japan and South Korea, Mr. Trump and his advisers are staying on the sidelines.
The inability or unwillingness of Washington to help defuse the flash points is one of the clearest signs yet of the erosion of American power and global influence under Mr. Trump, who has stuck to his “America First” idea of disengagement, analysts say.
“Without the steady centripetal force of American diplomacy, disorder in Asia is spinning in all sorts of dangerous directions,” said William J. Burns, a deputy secretary of state in the Obama administration and the president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “The net result is not only increased risk of regional turbulence, but also long-term corrosion of American influence.”
All American administrations have limited ability to steer events abroad. Foreign governments often ignore requests from the United States. Since 2001, the nation’s long wars, especially in Iraq, have cost it credibility. And the emergence of China as an economic powerhouse and Russia as an anti-Western force means factors outside the Trump administration are contributing to the weakening of American power.
But critics say Mr. Trump’s policies — more focused on cutting American expenses abroad than on building partnerships — have sped that erosion and emboldened governments to ignore entreaties from Washington.
Indian troops are suppressing protests in the contested region of Kashmir after New Delhi ended the territory’s autonomous status, despite Mr. Trump’s offer last month to India and Pakistan to mediate the decades-old dispute.
South Korea announced on Monday that it was dropping Japan from a list of preferred trading partners, ramping up a conflict that jeopardizes Washington’s most important alliances in Asia. Mr. Trump’s top foreign policy officials had advised both nations to settle their differences, to no avail.
Meanwhile, North Korea, the biggest security threat in East Asia, has done five recent tests of short-range ballistic missiles or rocket systems — with no chastisement from Mr. Trump.
And Chinese officials said this week that Hong Kong protesters were starting to show the first signs of “terrorism” — an indication that the Communist Party in Beijing could order tougher measures to end the unrest, even after the Hong Kong police fired tear gas at crowds during the 10th weekend of protests.
Official Chinese news organizations are linking the Trump administration to the protests and labeled an American diplomat, Julie Eadeh, who met with student leaders, a “black hand.”
Tweeting on Tuesday that the Chinese were moving troops to the border with Hong Kong, Mr. Trump issued no warnings other than: “Everyone should be calm and safe!”
“The inability to manage the issues shows some real weakness in the president’s actual commitment to the strategy or any forward diplomatic engagement in Asia,” said Michael J. Green, a senior Asia director for the National Security Council under President George W. Bush.
Mr. Green, now a professor at Georgetown University, added that while the Trump administration was carrying out some useful strategies or tactics in Asia, “it is striking how ineffective the administration is on this Japan-Korea issue and how quiet on Kashmir.”
Though Mr. Trump has embraced a hands-off approach since he took office, some officials, including Matthew Pottinger, the senior Asia director on the National Security Council, have worked to formulate a big-picture strategy on Asia, with the aim of bolstering competition with China.
They have pledged to spend money on regional programs as part of a “free and open Indo-Pacific” strategy, increased the rate of freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea and started a campaign to try to persuade nations to ban the use of communications technology from Huawei, the Chinese company.
But critics say Mr. Trump weakens the American position through continual acts of self-sabotage, including abandoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade agreement that Mr. Obama had forged to create a united front against China.
Mr. Trump also lavishes praise on East Asia’s authoritarian leaders — he said that he and Kim Jong-un of North Korea “fell in love,” and that he and Xi Jinping of China “will always be friends.”
So far, he and his top officials have failed to send any strong signals on the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests. On Aug. 1, Mr. Trump employed the language used by Communist Party officials when he said Hong Kong has had “riots for a long period of time.”
“Somebody said that at some point they’re going to want to stop that,” he added. “But that’s between Hong Kong and that’s between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China.”
Analysts said those comments would be interpreted by Chinese officials as a green light to take whatever action necessary to quell the protests.
Mr. Trump said in June that the United States and China were “strategic partners,” and the administration has held back from taking certain actions that would upset Beijing — notably, imposing sanctions on Chinese officials for the mass detentions of Muslims and approving the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan.
Mr. Trump’s main goal with China has been to reach a trade deal to end the costly tariff war, though the two sides have escalated the dispute after failed talks, leading to stock market turmoil.
Mr. Trump has also stood back during the intensifying feud between South Korea and Japan. On Friday, Mr. Trump said, “South Korea and Japan have to sit down and get along with each other.”
Administration officials say they do not want to be a mediator in the dispute, even though American security interests in the region could suffer — especially if Seoul and Tokyo end an intelligence-sharing agreement supported by Washington that is intended to help with North Korea containment. In late July, John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, called both sides to ask them to freeze their hostilities, and Mr. Pompeo made the same request of their foreign ministers at a summit in Bangkok.
South Korean and Japanese officials are ignoring the Americans. On Monday, Seoul said that not only was it ending a preferential trading partnership with Tokyo, but it was also naming Japan as the first nation on a new list of countries deemed to have bad export practices. Earlier this month, Japan announced that South Korea was no longer a preferred trading partner.
“By failing to act and assume leadership in the region, Trump is allowing nations with long, complicated histories to fall back into traditional rivalries,” said Jean H. Lee, a Korea expert at the Wilson Center.
“The more these nations feel the United States is an unreliable partner,” she added, “the more they will feel compelled to defend themselves. I’m already starting to hear growing calls in South Korea for their own nuclear weapons.”
In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pushed ahead with what appears to be a yearslong plan by Hindu nationalist politicians to control Kashmir, a majority-Muslim region.
Some Indian analysts say Mr. Modi might have accelerated the move because of remarks made by Mr. Trump after his meeting last month with Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan. Mr. Trump said that Mr. Modi had asked Mr. Trump earlier if he could mediate the Kashmir dispute. “If I can help, I would love to be a mediator,” Mr. Trump said.
That is a position welcomed by Pakistan, while India opposes outside involvement. India’s Ministry of External Affairs denied that Mr. Modi had any such conversation with Mr. Trump. Then on Aug. 5, the Indian government revoked Kashmir’s special status and began arresting top Kashmiri politicians — a complete rejection of Mr. Trump’s offer of mediation.
“There’s more the United States should do,” Asad Majeed Khan, Pakistan’s ambassador to the United States, said in an interview on Monday. “The United States is perhaps the only country that can make a difference.”
John J. Sullivan, the deputy secretary of state, is traveling to India this week for meetings planned before the outbreak of the Kashmir crisis. It is unclear what he will say. Mr. Burns, his predecessor, said, “Modi’s India seems unfazed by any American concerns over the potential for escalation.”

Chinese Nationalists Bring Threat of Violence to Australia Universities,"A clash with Hong Kong supporters at a student protest could be a dark omen of what’s to come.
BRISBANE, Australia — The Chinese nationalists disrupting pro-Hong Kong democracy rallies at the University of Queensland arrived 300 strong, with a speaker to blast China’s national anthem. They deferred to a leader in a pink shirt. And their tactics included violence.
One video from the scene shows a student from Hong Kong being grabbed by the throat. Another shows a philosophy student, Drew Pavlou, 20, shouting, “Hey hey, ho ho, Xi Jinping has got to go,” until a counterprotester throws his megaphone aside.
The altercations, which took place last Wednesday in the main square of a major Australian university, were broken up by the police, but experts believe it could be a dark omen of what is to come as the passions of Hong Kong protesters ripple to other countries.
A similar scuffle broke out on Tuesday at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, when three Chinese men were filmed shouting down students from Hong Kong at a rally and pushing a young woman to the ground.
For Australia in particular, the past week signals trouble after years of gliding along and growing rich off China’s growth. Australian universities have come to depend on Chinese donors, students and organizations that are often loyal to Beijing and intolerant of dissent.
More collisions with China’s muscular nationalism now seem likely. Racist chants and insults have been traded, along with punches. The Chinese Consulate in Brisbane praised the “spontaneous patriotic behavior” of the pro-China activists — leading the Australian defense minister to take the extraordinary step of warning foreign diplomats against attempts to suppress free speech.
Deconstructing what led to the clashes on Wednesday, through interviews, online messages and videos, reveals just how volatile, racially charged and violent any reckoning with China may become.
“It would certainly be nice if it didn’t escalate, but I remain quite concerned that the entire way this has been handled makes copycat attacks inevitable,” said Kevin Carrico, a senior lecturer in Chinese Studies at Monash University in Melbourne. “It’s quite worrying.”
New activists and new causes
The protest began with two students: Jack Yiu, 21, a quiet psychology major from Hong Kong, and Mr. Pavlou, a chatty grandson of Greek immigrants from Brisbane.
Both new to activism, they didn’t know each other until a few weeks ago.
Until recently, Mr. Yiu had led the university’s Hong Kong Student Association, holding benign activities like welcome dinners. Mr. Pavlou was known on campus for starting a popular Facebook group for intellectual debate.
But recent events involving China, they said, forced them to act. Mr. Yiu said he had friends in Hong Kong marching for democracy and against a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. Mr. Pavlou said his own outrage was prompted by reading about Xinjiang, a region of China where the government has pushed minority Muslims into re-education camps.
“It’s cultural genocide,” Mr. Pavlou said.
Adding to his anger, he discovered his own university had cultivated close ties with Chinese officials. While the University of Queensland is one of several universities with a Confucius Institute — officially a program to promote Chinese language and culture — the vice chancellor, Peter Hoj, has made more of that relationship than his peers have.
The institute at the university plays a broader role, emphasizing collaboration with China in science, engineering and technology. Until late last year, Mr. Hoj was an unpaid consultant for the Confucius Institute headquarters. This month, he granted a visiting professorship to the Chinese consul general in Brisbane, Xu Jie, bringing a Communist Party official into university life at a time when the United States, Canada and several European countries have cut ties.
“It’s part of this China illiteracy, which is quite prevalent in Australia,” said Louisa Lim, a professor at the University of Melbourne and the author of “The People’s Republic of Amnesia: Tiananmen Revisited.”
“In many cases,” she said, “the allure of Chinese investment and large numbers of Chinese students has been so overwhelming that educational institutions have just thrown their arms wide open without doing their due diligence.”
In a statement online, the University of Queensland said that the consul general would not be teaching and was one of 260 titleholders appointed in recent years.
But for Mr. Pavlou, who is majoring primarily in philosophy, his university’s warm welcome has legitimized a culture of disinformation and censorship. He said his anger crystallized after a student Facebook group, called StalkerSpace, filled up with pro-China statements around the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen   Square massacre in June.
“I saw all these people denying things that happened or stating the official government line on it, and like to me, that was really disgusting and horrifying,” Mr. Pavlou said.
A recent poll of Australians’ views on foreign affairs, by the Lowy Institute, found that many Australians were experiencing a similar shift: Only 32 percent of respondents said they trust China either “a great deal” or “somewhat” to act responsibly, a 20-point fall from 2018.
Mr. Pavlou said the recent protests in Hong Kong were an inspiration. He found Mr. Yiu through other activists, and they agreed to back-to-back rallies on July 24: The Hong Kong students would start at 10 a.m.; Mr. Pavlou and his group, broadening the focus to the university’s China ties, would start at noon.
Mr. Pavlou posted a notice of the event on Facebook. That’s when the trouble started.

Counterprotesters emerge
“Yo bro where u from? Australia?” said the Facebook message from an account with the name Frank Wang. “If so u better want to stay away from political problem.”
“Cancel the event,” the message continued. “If u keep doing this, uv gonna face millions of people on your opposite side.”
Other messages were more aggressive. Mixing Chinese and English, some people called Mr. Pavlou a white pig, using a pig emoji. One comment in Chinese said: “When will you die.”
Mr. Pavlou was drawn into trading insults with some of them. “It was out of fear and anger,” he said. “It was silly. I regret it.”
Nonetheless, he carried on. The first protest was uneventful. A wall filled up with sticky notes of support, mirroring those in Hong Kong. But by the time Mr. Pavlou and a few others started their protest, a crowd had gathered.
Several people there estimated that about 300 people — appearing to be a mix of Chinese students and nonstudents — appeared suddenly. Within minutes, someone had grabbed Mr. Pavlou’s megaphone, prompting him to jump up and push back.
Security guards intervened, but the leader of the counterprotesters demanded an apology on China’s behalf.
“We tried to talk to them,” Mr. Yiu said. “On the megaphone, I told them, we’re just fighting for Hong Kong democracy, not independence.”
By 2:15 p.m., it had grown tense. Mr. Pavlou, who had continued the protest inside the Confucius Institute’s offices, re-emerged to see 50 or so Hong Kong students surrounded.
Priya De, 22, a leader with the socialist group that connected Mr. Yiu and Mr. Pavlou, said she heard white Australians shouting “Go back to China” at the Chinese students, and “Deport them, deport them.”
A video shot by a Hong Kong student showed David Chui, 23, a business student from Hong Kong, being grabbed by the throat and thrown to the ground.
Christy Leung, 21, another Hong Kong student, said a sign was torn from her hands and her clothing ripped. She and Mr. Chui went to the police to press charges. They were told there was nothing they could do.
“I don’t know how to be hopeful,” Ms. Leung said. “People told me to report it and I did, but it didn’t work.”
The aftermath
Mr. Pavlou’s group is planning another protest this week. The university said that it opened an investigation into the clash, and it issued a statement defending free speech but proposing that the demonstration be held in a more remote area of campus.
“It’s simply a way to starve the protest of visibility,” Mr. Pavlou said.
Some students would rather see it canceled. A half-dozen students from mainland China interviewed around campus on Tuesday called any demonstration against Chinese influence unnecessary and useless.
Some activists on the left, noting that the Hong Kong Student Association is not involved, said they worried that any protest led by Australians who were not from Hong Kong or mainland China would only contribute to anti-Chinese racism.
But for Mr. Pavlou, Mr. Yiu, and many others, there is no turning back. A group of Tibetan students has aligned with Mr. Pavlou’s group, calling for the university to shut down its Confucius Institute.
Mr. Yiu and his fellow Hong Kong students are planning more rallies, coordinating with groups all over Australia.
“People in Hong Kong are risking their lives,” Ms. Leung said. “The threats we faced last week are nothing compared to them. We have to stand up. With them.”

China Cannot Erase the Truth of Tiananmen,"Even after 30 years, erasing the history of the massacre in Tiananmen Square remains an obsession of the Chinese Communist Party. To a degree, it has succeeded: The Chinese raised in the extraordinary boom times since that day often know little about what happened on June 4, 1989, or accept the official line that curbing the “counterrevolutionaries” was needed to facilitate the economic miracle.
But those who were there, and many of those who know what happened when the Chinese Army crushed the two-month-old democracy protests, cannot forget — and cannot accept that anyone else should. One of them is Jiang Lin, a former military journalist, who was in the square that night and has been consumed ever since by what she witnessed, and who shared her agonizing memories in a series of interviews with The Times’s Chris Buckley.
Ms. Jiang is 66 now, and she left China last week. Had she not, it is very likely that she would have shared the fate of the many other Chinese who have been repressed because their conscience would not let them stay silent. “The pain has eaten at me for 30 years,” she said. “Everyone who took part must speak up about what they know happened. That’s our duty to the dead, the survivors and the children of the future.”
Hers is an anguish and a mission shared by many people around the world scarred by great atrocities, whether survivors of the Holocaust; or relatives of the “disappeared” in Argentina; or those who carry the memories of the Soviet gulag, the Armenian genocide in Ottoman Turkey, the Khmer Rouge killing fields of Cambodia, the massacres in Rwanda or any of the other mass murders of modern times.
The degree to which a nation is prepared to acknowledge its historical sins reflects the degree to which it has embraced freedom. A democratic West Germany made serious efforts after World War II to confront its Nazi past. With the restoration of democracy, Argentina began prosecuting perpetrators of its “dirty war” against dissidents.
But authoritarian regimes are firm believers in the George Orwell dictum “Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.” The Soviet Union was forever rewriting or blotting out its history to maintain its power over its people, and China has similarly sought to manipulate national narratives and memories, whether through censorship or by force.
Why the ruling Communist Party feels a need to suppress all knowledge of Tiananmen Square is not hard to understand. China’s Communists saw an existential threat in the mass demonstrations around the country demanding fundamental democratic reforms, and the ferocity with which Tiananmen was cleared left hundreds, perhaps several thousands, dead; the toll has never been given. This is not a history the stewards of a “People’s Republic” want known.
Allowing an open discussion of what happened would raise serious questions about the judgment of a purportedly infallible party; about whether China’s economic boom might actually have been delayed by the massacre; about whether China would be even more prosperous today, like Hong Kong or Taiwan, had it adopted democratic reforms sought by the protesters.
Ms. Jiang’s testimony is especially important because she was not a demonstrator; she was a card-carrying member of the military establishment, daughter of a general and herself a lieutenant in the army. In her capacity as a military journalist she tried to spread word of a letter from senior generals opposing martial law. And then she got on her bicycle and went to Tiananmen. There, she saw what happened when the warnings were not heeded, and suffered a serious head wound in the melee.
Her witness is a fundamental challenge to the claim of the Communist authorities that their actions served the people. “How could fate suddenly turn so that you could use tanks and machine guns against ordinary people?” she asked. “To me, it was madness.”
China has changed dramatically in the three decades since that fateful moment. But its leadership has not kept pace, continuing to resist everything the protesters demanded — a democratic and law-abiding society, an independent judiciary, an end to one-party rule. That’s why the party hierarchy expends so much effort in avoiding an accounting for the madness in its past, and that’s why it’s so important that people like Ms. Jiang refuse to let them erase the memory of Tiananmen.

How China Uses LinkedIn to Recruit Spies Abroad,"Western intelligence officials say Chinese agents are contacting thousands of foreign citizens using LinkedIn, including former government officials.
WASHINGTON — One former senior foreign policy official in the Obama administration received messages from someone on LinkedIn offering to fly him to China and connect him with “well paid” opportunities.
A former Danish Foreign Ministry official got LinkedIn messages from someone appearing to be a woman at a Chinese headhunting firm wanting to meet in Beijing. Three middle-aged men showed up instead and said they could help the former official gain “great access to the Chinese system” for research.
A former Obama White House official and career diplomat was befriended on LinkedIn by a person who claimed to be a research fellow at the California Institute of Technology, with a profile page showing connections to White House aides and ambassadors. No such fellow exists.
Foreign agents are exploiting social media to try to recruit assets, with LinkedIn as a prime hunting ground, Western counterintelligence officials say. Intelligence agencies in the United States, Britain, Germany and France have issued warnings about foreign agents approaching thousands of users on the site. Chinese spies are the most active, officials say.
“We’ve seen China’s intelligence services doing this on a mass scale,” said William R. Evanina, the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, a government agency that tracks foreign spying and alerts companies to possible infiltration. “Instead of dispatching spies to the U.S. to recruit a single target, it’s more efficient to sit behind a computer in China and send out friend requests to thousands of targets using fake profiles.”
The use of social media by Chinese government operatives for what American officials and executives call nefarious purposes has drawn heightened scrutiny in recent weeks. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube said they deleted accounts that had spread disinformation about the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests. Twitter alone said it removed nearly 1,000 accounts.
It was the first time Facebook and Twitter had taken down accounts linked to disinformation from China. Many governments have employed similar playbooks to sow disinformation since Russia used the tactic to great effect in 2015 and 2016.
LinkedIn, owned by Microsoft, is both another vehicle for potential disinformation and, more important, an ideal one for espionage recruitment, American officials say.
That is because many of its 645 million users are seeking employment opportunities, often from strangers. To enhance their prospects, many former government employees advertise that they have security clearances.
LinkedIn is also the only major American social media platform not blocked in China because the company has agreed to censor posts containing delicate material.
Chinese agents often make offers over various channels, including LinkedIn, to bring the prospective recruit to China, sometimes through the guise of a corporate recruiting firm offering to pay them for speaking or consulting engagements or aid in research. From there, agents develop the relationship.
“The Chinese want to build these options with political, academic and business elites,” said Jonas Parello-Plesner, the former Danish Foreign Ministry official who reported the apparent recruiting attempt by the Chinese that began over LinkedIn. “A lot of this thrives in the gray zone or the spectrum between influence-seeking and interference or classical espionage.”
People who have just left government are especially vulnerable because they are often looking for new employment, he and other former officials say.
Nicole Leverich, a spokeswoman for LinkedIn, said the company proactively finds fake accounts to remove and has a team that acts on information from a variety of sources, including government agencies.
“We enforce our policies, which are very clear: The creation of a fake account or fraudulent activity with an intent to mislead or lie to our members is a violation of our terms of service,” she said.
Some photographs on fake accounts are generated by artificial intelligence, The Associated Press reported.
In multiple recent cases, LinkedIn proved to be an effective recruiting tool. A former employee of the C.I.A. and Defense Intelligence Agency, Kevin Patrick Mallory, was sentenced in May to 20 years in prison for spying for China. The relationship began after he replied in February 2017 to a LinkedIn message from a Chinese intelligence agent posing as a think tank representative, the F.B.I. said.
The Justice Department last October charged a Chinese intelligence agent, Yanjun Xu, with economic espionage after he recruited a GE Aviation engineer in a relationship that began on LinkedIn, according to the indictment.
Mr. Evanina, the counterintelligence chief, told Reuters last year that Chinese agents were contacting thousands of people at a time on LinkedIn. “It’s the ultimate playground for collection,” he said.
That level of activity has not dropped, though Mr. Evanina declined to give statistics.
“People in the private sector and academia are also being targeted this way,” he said this month. “Foreign intelligence services are looking for anyone with access to the information they want, whether classified or unclassified, including corporate trade secrets, intellectual property and other research.”
The Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
The former Obama senior foreign policy official, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of jeopardizing future interactions related to China, described in interviews a monthslong recruitment effort by someone who appeared to be a Chinese spy.
In May 2017, five months after the official left his government job and just after he made a trip to China, someone called Robinson Zhang reached out via LinkedIn.
Mr. Zhang’s profile photograph features the Hong Kong skyline, and he identifies as a public relations manager for a company called R&C Capital. In a message to the former official, Mr. Zhang described R&C as “an international consulting company based in Hong Kong” that specializes in “global investment, geopolitical issues, public policy, etc.”
“I’m quite impressed by your CV and think you may be right for some opportunities, which are all well paid,” Mr. Zhang wrote, according to screenshots of the exchanges.
The words struck him as strange, the former official said, so he asked Mr. Zhang for a website. Mr. Zhang directed him to a home page with an image of the Eiffel Tower but little information about R&C Capital. It appeared to be “something he made up on the fly,” the former official said. (The New York Times viewed the site, which was deleted sometime after The Times emailed the company for an interview request.)
Mr. Zhang repeatedly indicated that his company could pay for a trip to China. The former official asked multiple times for more detail on the company but did not get any substantive responses.
In a message in August 2017, Mr. Zhang said that Zhejiang University had “already determined a candidate” for a conference on China’s Belt and Road infrastructure projects before suggesting other opportunities — even though the two had not shared any earlier exchanges about this or any other event.
The former official referred Mr. Zhang to a speakers’ agency representing him and has not heard from Mr. Zhang since.
Although the site for R&C Capital listed its address as No. 68 Mody Road in Hong Kong, there is no company by that name there. The company is also not included in the Hong Kong corporate registration database.
Mr. Parello-Plesner, the Danish official, had similar exchanges on LinkedIn with a user by the name of Grace Woo who contacted him in 2011.
Ms. Woo said she worked for DRHR, a headhunting company in Hangzhou, China. When she learned Mr. Parello-Plesner was visiting Beijing in 2012, she suggested he stop by Hangzhou to meet with the company. She asked for an image of his passport so she could make travel arrangements, but he declined.
Mr. Parello-Plesner agreed to meet in the St. Regis Hotel in Beijing. Ms. Woo never appeared, but a young man who said he was from DRHR guided Mr. Parello-Plesner to a conference room, where three middle-aged men welcomed him. They said they were from a government research organization, but they did not have business cards.
“I thought, ‘This meeting is very dodgy,’” Mr. Parello-Plesner said.
The men told Mr. Parello-Plesner they could fund his research if he worked with them, promising “‘really great access to the Chinese system,’” he said.
Mr. Parello-Plesner, suspecting the men were intelligence or security officials, reported the meeting to British officials when he returned to London, where he lived at the time.
“If I were LinkedIn, I would proactively do my homework now,” said Mr. Parello-Plesner, who has researched China’s foreign interference operations as a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and wrote about his encounter last year. “This was just the tip of the iceberg.”
DRHR was one of three companies German domestic intelligence officials singled out in December 2017 as front organizations for Chinese agents. Those officials concluded that Chinese agents had used LinkedIn to try to contact 10,000 Germans, and LinkedIn shut down some accounts, including those of DRHR and Ms. Woo.
Last October, French intelligence agencies told the government that Chinese agents had used social networks — LinkedIn in particular — to try to contact 4,000 French individuals. Targets included government employees, scientists and company executives, according to Le Figaro, the French newspaper.
It can be hard to pinpoint the origins of the people behind fake social media accounts. The former Obama White House official and career diplomat, Brett Bruen, said a user by the name of Donna Alexander contacted him in 2017 on LinkedIn. Her profile says she is a research fellow at the California Institute of Technology, but the photograph is of an actress.
A spokeswoman for the university said it has no record of an employee by that name.
Ms. Alexander’s network on LinkedIn includes White House officials and former ambassadors, according to screenshots seen by The Times. “This person seems to have ingratiated herself with or gotten accepted by a lot of people in the foreign policy structure of U.S. government,” Mr. Bruen said.
At the same time, Western intelligence agencies are discovering another potential issue with LinkedIn — some of their operatives have no account there at all, which might raise questions about a person’s true identity among foreign officials or counterintelligence agents. Mr. Bruen said one European official told him that his country’s intelligence agency was creating “the most boring LinkedIn profiles possible — a shallow cover so it doesn’t arouse suspicion.”

China’s TikTok Blazes New Ground. That Could Doom It.,"The rise of the seemingly innocuous app is forcing Americans to consider a world influenced by a Chinese-backed social media network.
American leaders have effectively thrown Huawei and a handful of Chinese surveillance technology companies out of the country, warning darkly of the national security and privacy threats of installing Made-in-China products into sensitive parts of the nation’s electronic infrastructure.
Now they have cast their fearful gaze on a new Chinese target: the dancing and singing teens and tweens of TikTok.
A secretive federal panel with a national security focus is reviewing the purchase of TikTok two years ago by a Chinese company called Bytedance, The New York Times and others reported last week. Three senators have asked the Trump administration to review potential national security and privacy threats posed by the app, warning that Bytedance could strip out content that displeases the Communist Party, such as videos of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.
TikTok denies that it censors political content. Videos supporting the protesters and declaring “Reclaim Hong Kong!” can be found on the app.
Still, TikTok’s popularity — if you’re the parent of a teenager, that teenager probably has it on her phone — blazes uncharted territory. Its unexpected rise is forcing Americans for the first time to consider living in a world influenced by a Chinese-backed social media network.
That invites the public to take a closer look at Bytedance. It is not an arm of the Communist Party. However, it owes much of its success to its ability to navigate Beijing’s political currents, as well as its skills in delivering harmless fluff that could pass muster with censors.
In fact, its founder, Zhang Yiming, has echoed the comments of Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg that he runs a technology company, not a media company. And yet that hasn’t stopped Facebook from influencing events around the world, with profound and troubling consequences.
No other Chinese tech company has succeeded on the global internet like Bytedance. The country’s vibrant social media platforms and viral video apps have had little success elsewhere beyond the Chinese diaspora. In a time when some in Washington are trying to pry apart the close economic ties between the United States in China, the two countries already live in different worlds when it comes to cyberspace.
TikTok, however, is ascending on the global internet scene just as the technological Iron Curtain is drawing. It has had nearly 1.5 billion downloads globally and 122 million in the United States, according to the data firm Sensor Tower.
That alarms some in Washington. In a letter to American intelligence officials, Senators Chuck Schumer and Tom Cotton said the TikTok platform was “a potential target of foreign influence campaigns like those carried out during the 2016 election on U.S.-based social media platforms.”
They and others point to recent articles claiming or suggesting that TikTok strips out videos of Hong Kong’s protests.
TikTok disputes the allegations, saying that it stores its American user data locally and doesn’t “remove content based on sensitivities related to China.”
“We have never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content, and we would not do so if asked,” it said. “Period.”
That statement doesn’t cover the breadth of the pressure Beijing puts on media companies in China. Rather than outright censoring content, Chinese officials often set broad guidelines for media companies and then let them censor themselves.
TikTok at times has avoided uncomfortable topics entirely. A look at the guidelines on the app when downloaded in Hong Kong shows that they forbid politics-related content and comments.
TikTok updated the guidelines after it was asked about them by The Times, saying that they were supposed to be taken down in May and resurfaced by error. Its Hong Kong content moderation team is partly based in mainland China but is moving to Hong Kong, and it will follow the same rules that the company sets everywhere else, TikTok said.
All that said, TikTok’s critics have yet to offer evidence that Beijing is using TikTok to spread propaganda to young minds, or that it is misusing user data. That may not help its fortunes in the United States: The American government has never offered proof that Huawei’s equipment is a security threat, yet its equipment has been essentially banned from telecommunications networks anyway.
Mr. Zuckerberg, whose company is busily trying to emulate TikTok, argues that the Chinese-owned app represents a competition of values.
“Until recently, the internet in almost every country outside China has been defined by American platforms with strong free expression values. There’s no guarantee these values will win out,” he said in a recent speech at Georgetown University, where he specifically cited TikTok.
Of course, his company once tried to develop software that would allow potential Chinese partners to block content they didn’t like. But the comments strike at a broader truth: To do business on the Chinese internet, any company there has to abide by the government’s wishes, whether it wants to or not.
Bytedance is no different. It was founded in 2012 by Mr. Zhang when he was 29. A geeky programmer, Mr. Zhang says the day in second grade when he received a Tetris hand-held game device was one of the happiest of his life. In college, he was known for his skills in repairing personal computers.
Some people in China compare him to Mr. Zuckerberg. Like the Facebook boss, Mr. Zhang had said machines do a better job than people at distributing content. When Bytedance introduced Toutiao, a news aggregation app that became hugely popular in China, it was run by software instead of an editor in chief. Mostly, it delivered headlines to users based on what they had clicked before.
“I can’t accurately decide whether something is good or bad, highbrow or lowbrow,” Mr. Zhang told a Chinese business magazine in 2016. “I may have my judgment, but I don’t want to impose it on Toutiao.”
For many users, that system delivered a steady stream of pablum, depending on what they had clicked before: bikini photos, silly videos, pet memes. Soon a backlash developed.
“Zhang Yiming and his engineers train the machine to understand your heart,” a blogger, He Jiayan, wrote. “At the same time they’re training you so you’ll be addicted to the machine.”
The TikTok spokesman said the app and other Bytedance apps had a time management feature that allowed users and parents to set limits of 40, 60 or 120 minutes.
The algorithm-driven approach has worked well for Bytedance. By the end of 2016, Toutiao became China’s No. 2 app after the messaging app WeChat, based on the time users spent on it per day, according to QuestMobile, a Chinese data firm. Last year, it raised a new round of funding from investors including SoftBank that valued it at $75 billion, making it one of the most valuable start-ups in the world.
Toutiao also attracted the attention of Lu Wei, China’s heavy-handed internet czar at the time, according to industry executives. When other internet companies complained that Toutiao was stealing their content, one of Mr. Lu’s top lieutenants told them that he was a fan and that they should stop complaining and work with the company, said two of them. They asked for anonymity because discussing the work of China’s censors in public is tantamount to corporate suicide.
Bytedance denies that it had a close relationship with Mr. Lu or benefited from any connection with him. Mr. Lu stepped down from his post in mid-2016 and was sentenced this year to 14 years in prison for corruption.
Then the company had its own run-ins with the censors. In April 2018, Bytedance and a few other star start-ups were punished for running “unhealthy” content. The company was ordered to shut down an app called Neihan Duanzi for hosting vulgar jokes and videos.
Mr. Zhang apologized, saying in a letter that he took responsibility for content that was incompatible with “core socialist values.” He vowed to strengthen party building at Bytedance and announced that he would enhance the role of the editor in chief and expand the content moderation team to 10,000 from 6,000. Like other online outlets, Toutiao also began featuring stories about Xi Jinping, China’s leader, at the top of its feed.
His apology seemed to be well received. Within two weeks, he delivered a keynote speech at a technology conference hosted by internet regulators. His topic: Bytedance’s global expansion strategy.

"For Both Trump and Xi, Trade Deal Comes Amid Growing Pressures at Home","BEIJING — The interim trade pact announced Friday between the United States and China came together as both countries’ leaders faced mounting political pressures and rising economic worries at home.
For months, President Trump has increased pressure on Beijing with higher tariffs on Chinese goods, insisting on a comprehensive trade deal that addressed a long list of concerns about how China manages its economy. And for months, senior Chinese officials met Mr. Trump’s escalating tariffs with their own as they remained equally emphatic that any deal must completely erase Mr. Trump’s tariffs.
On Friday, both sides decided that half a deal was better than none, consenting to a preliminary agreement that would involve China buying more American farm products and taking several other limited steps to open its economy in exchange for the United States forgoing its planned tariff increase next week.
The truce will help calm a trade fight that has taken a significant toll on the world’s two largest economies and threatened to further slow global growth at a precarious moment. Perhaps more important, it will help both Mr. Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, secure a win in the midst of domestic tumult.
Mr. Xi faces violent street protests in Hong Kong, as well as sharply rising grocery prices that could be brought down with imports of American food. Mr. Trump is eager to change the conversation away from an impeachment inquiry and a rapidly widening series of questions about his team’s involvement in Ukraine. And both leaders are confronting a steady drip of negative economic news, as the trade war weighs on manufacturing and business investment.
“It’s pretty clear that the U.S. and China have fought this trade war to a stalemate,” said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “At the moment, neither side sees any real advantage in escalation. The president wants an off-ramp for electoral reasons, and I think the Chinese want an off-ramp primarily for economic reasons.”
Mr. Trump and his advisers have denied that the trade war has caused any economic damage in the United States, instead blaming a strong dollar as well as the Federal Reserve, which has already begun cutting interest rates. But the evidence is becoming harder to ignore. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund warned that the trade war with China could cost the global economy around $700 billion by 2020 — a loss equivalent to the size of Switzerland’s entire economy.
Top Fed officials have also warned of economic risks from Mr. Trump’s trade war and cautioned that while the Fed will do what it can to keep the expansion going, its powers are limited. And stock markets, whose performance Mr. Trump has pointed to in the past as a barometer of his success as president, have been whipsawed by every escalation.
“Every time there’s a little bad news, the market would go down incredibly,” Mr. Trump said on Friday as he announced the deal. “Every time there was a little bit of good news, the market would go up incredibly.”
With Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign approaching, he and his advisers are increasingly conscious of the need to limit any economic damage, particularly among key political constituencies like farmers, who have suffered the most.
The American farm economy has stumbled into recession, hurt by a sharp drop-off in sales to China, among the largest export markets for agricultural goods like soybeans, pork and corn. While the administration has tried to blunt the pain with two rounds of financial assistance, farmers have increasingly pleaded with the White House to end the trade war, saying the handouts are not enough to make up for the lost sales.
That pain was set to get worse next week. Until Friday’s truce, Mr. Trump had planned to increase tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods to 30 percent from 25 percent, a hike that would likely have been met with further retaliation by China and been particularly burdensome for consumers and businesses going into the holiday season.
Mr. Trump said on Friday that China has agreed to buy $40 billion to $50 billion worth of American farm goods annually, after scaling up over a period of two years. He compared the figures to annual Chinese purchases before the trade war, which were about $24 billion.
“The deal I just made with China is, by far, the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Saturday morning. “In fact, there is a question as to whether or not this much product can be produced? Our farmers will figure it out. Thank you China!”
The compromise is even more timely for Mr. Xi. Sharply rising food prices have become a national issue in China. A lethal epidemic among the country’s pigs, with mortality as high as what people in Europe faced during the Black Death of the mid-14th century, has sent prices skyward for pork as well as for alternatives like beef and lamb.
As the Chinese public has begun asking, “Where’s the beef?”, China’s trade negotiators suddenly have an answer: It can come from the United States, along with a lot of pork, soybeans and other food.
But while the agreement will benefit certain industries, it will likely not reverse a trend toward greater economic divisions between the two countries.
If the understanding on Friday holds together, it would allow the United States to retain tariffs imposed over the past 16 months on a wide array of Chinese industries. That could prompt many companies to continue efforts to shift production away from China, possibly to the United States but more likely to American allies in Southeast Asia.
Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the agreement will defer new sanctions but do little to resolve the major underlying sources of friction between the two countries.
“It’s hard to see this really amounting to an actual de-escalation of tensions or anything that businesses can take to the bank,” Mr. Prasad said.
Mr. Trump has often criticized past administrations for ceding too much to China, and negotiating endlessly with limited results. China experts say that the many months of painful standoff have perhaps shown the limits to Mr. Trump’s winner-take-all approach.
“We can’t get Cuba to do what we want,” said Elizabeth C. Economy, the director for Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. “I don’t know why we could get China to do what we want.”
Negotiators say they will continue discussing other issues once the deal is signed. But the compromise does signal a shift in strategy for officials in the Trump administration, who had previously said they would settle for no less than a comprehensive pact that addressed so-called “structural issues.”
“What we want is fair trade,” Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump’s top negotiator, told Congress in February. “That requires structural change.”
American negotiators have talked about curbing various Chinese industrial policies that they view as harmful to American businesses, including China’s generous subsidies to its state-owned companies, policies that coerce technology away from multinational firms and a pernicious history of cybertheft.
But while the agreement includes some new protections on intellectual property, greater access for financial services companies and guidelines as to how China manages its currency, it does not appear to address several of these deeper concerns.
In a statement, the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents American companies that do business in China, said it hoped the tentative agreement would restore sufficient confidence to allow negotiators to tackle other issues, including “market-distorting subsidies for state-owned enterprises and equal treatment for U.S. and other foreign companies.”
Whether China will agree to deeper concessions is not guaranteed, particularly given Mr. Xi’s political sensitivities at home. Those crises have come at a bad time for Mr. Xi in terms of China’s political calendar.
In the next three weeks, Mr. Xi will face a long-awaited session of the 204-member Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The committee, which has not gathered since February of last year, holds enormous power in China and has authority to change the country’s leaders.
While Mr. Xi’s political dominance seems secure, he appears to be facing renewed pressure to share some of that power. His colleagues, particularly Premier Li Keqiang, who oversees government ministries while Mr. Xi oversees the Communist Party, have become slightly more visible lately, although still in Mr. Xi’s shadow.
As the Central Committee session approaches, Mr. Xi has taken personal responsibility to an unusual degree for both the status of China’s relationship with the United States as well as the general health of the Chinese economy. To handle the trade talks with the United States, Mr. Xi chose a Communist Party commission that he personally oversees, and put one of his closest advisers, Vice Premier Liu He, in charge of it.
“In the current dilemma, he to some extent needs to answer to the Central Committee members who attend the meeting,” wrote Deng Yuwen, a former editor at an influential Communist Party journal in Beijing, in an opinion column on Thursday.
The possibility that the deal announced on Friday falls apart after the Central Committee meets remains a real one. The Chinese appear to be hedging their bets. Chinese state media did not describe the arrangement on Saturday as an actual deal. Mr. Trump himself was quick to say on Friday that legal details of the deal had not yet been worked out and committed to paper.
China and the United States have reached two previous truces in their trade war — the first in December in Buenos Aires and the second in June in Osaka, Japan. The Buenos Aires accord lasted five months. The Osaka accord crumbled in a month.
“Anything can happen,” Mr. Trump said Friday when asked if the deal could fall apart before the two sides plan to sign it, at a summit of global leaders in Chile next month. “That can happen. I don’t think it will. I think we know each other very well.”

"In Hong Kong, a Publisher Struggles to Document Tiananmen’s Carnage","HONG KONG — Even after this city returned to Chinese control in 1997, it has traditionally held the largest annual vigil for the Tiananmen protesters killed in the government’s crackdown. It is home to the only museum dedicated to the events of 1989.
But as Beijing’s influence has increased, one of the greatest reservoirs of those memories — Hong Kong’s publishing industry — is imperiled. On the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown, people who produce books documenting it and other key moments in Chinese history fear they will soon be driven out of business.
“Independent publishing has been reduced to a nonprofit activity for preserving some important historical documents, memoirs and recollections,” said Bao Pu, the founder of New Century Press, one of the few surviving Hong Kong publishers focusing on modern China. “Otherwise it would be gone.”
Hong Kong once churned out a broad range of books focused on China’s modern history and Communist Party politics, from thinly sourced potboilers churned out under pen names to respected works of analysis by top authors. Books and magazines in Hong Kong were often the venue of choice for leaks from Communist Party elites, and where ousted mainland officials would shop their memoirs.
[ Photos of the Tiananmen protests  from a student witness.]
For years, Hong Kong publishers found a ready audience of mainland Chinese readers who wanted books they could not find at home and could sneak back into mainland China. But the industry has declined thanks to tighter border checks, the consolidation of Hong Kong distributors and retail outlets under mainland control, and the disappearance and imprisonment of independent booksellers.
“Authors are afraid to publish. Publishers are afraid to continue doing business. Distributors are also afraid,” said Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher for Human Rights Watch. “Bookstores are diminishing and people there are afraid, too. So are the buyers, of course. It’s an attack on the publishing industry from all aspects.”
New Century Press last week released “The Last Secret: The Final Documents From the June Fourth Crackdown,” a collection of statements and speeches on the Communist Party’s decision-making process in 1989, as well as an analysis of top leader Deng Xiaoping by the veteran journalist Dai Qing, and a memoir by the academic and Tiananmen hunger striker Zhou Duo. The three new books are particularly important to Mr. Bao. Now 52, he was a college senior in Beijing in 1989, and his father was the most senior Communist Party official to go to prison for siding with the calls for political reform.
“I met a lot of people at Tiananmen,” Mr. Bao said. “The event really changed our lives. It certainly changed mine.”
[New documents  show power games  behind Tiananmen crackdown.]
Mr. Bao said that publishing his latest three books — New Century’s sole output this year — required extraordinary efforts. And he wonders if he will be able to do it again.
The company could previously produce about one book a month, Mr. Bao said, but it has been hampered by various obstacles, including the loss of its longtime printer in Hong Kong, Asia One, which cut ties in 2016.
“There was no direct explanation, just ‘We don’t want to work with you anymore,’” said Mr. Bao. Peter Lau, the managing director of Asia One, denied any political pressure but said he did not recall why his company stopped working with New Century. New Century has since worked with printers outside Hong Kong.
China’s efforts to target outside publications stretch back decades, including a drive against materials from Hong Kong, Taiwan and elsewhere immediately after the Tiananmen massacre in 1989. The current effort, called the Southern Hill Project, began in 2010. Border checks were heightened to prevent travelers from bringing in books. Those that were caught had their books taken and were warned.
Sino United Publishing, which controls three bookstore chains in Hong Kong and as much as 70 percent of its publishing market, is ultimately controlled by China’s Ministry of Finance. The company has denied political influence in its decision-making, but at such shops, books critical of the Chinese leadership are either hidden away or nonexistent.
The People’s Recreation Community, a shop with a street sign featuring an image of Mao in a People’s Liberation Army cap, was a haven for readers from mainland China seeking such titles. It closed last year after a failed attempt to rebrand it as a cafe. The proprietor, Paul Tang, denied any outside pressure but blamed a lack of customers and new offerings from publishers.
And in the past few years, several Hong Kong media workers have been arrested or detained by Chinese officials, including the publisher Yiu Mantin, who was arrested in 2013, and the magazine journalists Guo Zhongxiao and Wang Jianmin in 2014.
In 2015, several employees of Mighty Current Media, which published gossipy books on Chinese politics, and its associated retail outlet, Causeway Bay Books, disappeared.
The Chinese authorities said the men had gone to the mainland voluntarily to help with an investigation. But another detained bookseller, Lam Wing-kee, revealed after being allowed to return to Hong Kong that he had been held in solitary confinement and forced to confess to illegal book sales.
In April, Mr. Lam fled Hong Kong for Taiwan out of fear he could be sent to mainland China under a new extradition law being considered by the Hong Kong government.
“I am very scared,” he said by telephone from Taiwan, where he has been given permission to remain until July.
The extradition changes have been criticized by press freedom organizations, which have said they would leave Hong Kong journalists and publishers open to politically motivated charges from the mainland, further eroding the foundations of free speech in Hong Kong.
Still, Ms. Wang said she is encouraged that people like Mr. Bao are continuing to work, and that some Hong Kong publishers do not intend to go quietly.
“I see the spirit is still there,” she said. “The system is more repressive, but people are still putting up a fight, no matter how hopeless it seems.”

China Plays ‘Fight the Landlord’ to Tame Hong Kong,"State media puts pressure on Li Ka-shing, a powerful property tycoon, showing the Communist Party’s view of business as a means of control.
“Fight the Landlord” is one of the most popular card games in China. The name comes from the 1950s, when the Chinese Communist Party confiscated property from landowners, often violently, in the name of the masses. As many as two million people were killed.
China’s state-controlled media is playing a new game of “Fight the Landlord,” and its target is one of the biggest landlords in the world: the 91-year-old Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing. Hong Kong’s summer of protests stems mainly from sky-high housing costs, China’s media argues, and Mr. Li and other local real estate tycoons should be held responsible.
“In the current chaotic situation in Hong Kong, many young people are venting their dissatisfaction with high housing prices and expensive rents at the government,” said an official commentary by the party’s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, which oversees China’s police and courts. “They’re probably blaming the wrong target.”
The return of “Fight the Landlord” lays bare the Communist Party’s shifting attitudes toward the business world. Hong Kong’s property tycoons were once big beneficiaries of an unspoken pact between Beijing and business: They could wheel and deal as they liked, so long as they helped China achieve its economic dreams and left the politics to the Communist Party.
Today, as the party tightens its grip over daily Chinese life, business has become another tool for control. Business leaders who aren’t sufficiently loyal can suddenly find themselves at risk.
And in Hong Kong, where companies operate under a different set of laws but still depend on the mainland for their profits, China’s state media is increasingly willing to threaten or humiliate any business leader who stands in the way.
The party’s growing reach raises questions about the future of people like Mr. Li — and, by extension, of all of Hong Kong. Mr. Li was a consummate player of the old game, cultivating ties with Beijing’s most powerful leaders even as he increased his wealth. But under Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, the party has demanded absolute loyalty, eliminating some of the gray areas where business in Hong Kong once stood.
“One of the biggest characteristics of Mr. Xi’s ruling style is that he’s not interested in uniting different interest groups,” said Leung Man-tao, a Hong Kong writer and commentator who has big followings in both the mainland and Hong Kong. “He can’t see the value of gray areas. He wants absolute loyalty.”
In the mainland, the party has taken a direct role in how some of China’s biggest and most successful companies do business.
This past summer, Chinese officials met with the country’s two most powerful internet tycoons, Jack Ma of Alibaba and Pony Ma of Tencent, to talk about deeper cooperation between state-owned enterprises and the tech giants. Just two years ago, their companies plowed billions of dollars into backing one state-owned telecommunications company.
In September, officials in the Chinese city of Hangzhou said they would appoint a government representative to serve as a liaison in the top offices of companies based there, including Alibaba. They said the goal was to improve coordination between government and business.
Businesspeople who don’t get on board risk becoming targets.
Wang Gongquan, a billionaire venture capitalist who advocated more liberal political and social policies, was detained in September 2013 and jailed for five months. Ren Zhiqiang, a property developer, found his social media accounts deleted when he used them to criticize the party’s tightening control over discourse and is no longer allowed to leave the country.
Since the protests began, Beijing has taken a more direct role in Hong Kong. State-controlled media has castigated Cathay Pacific and other employers whose workers joined the protests. Beijing has urged representatives from nearly 100 of China’s biggest state-run companies to step up investment and assert more control of companies in Hong Kong, according to Reuters.
Now the government is taking on Hong Kong’s property developers, a group that has long sought to stay in Beijing’s good graces. Hong Kong’s largest pro-Beijing political party in September called on the city government to take back land from property developers to build affordable housing. Some property companies have said they would turn over some plots, though Mr. Li has not made his plans public.
Beijing’s accusations against Mr. Li and the other real estate tycoons aren’t groundless. The cozy relationship between the Hong Kong government and wealthy property developers has long drawn criticism from experts who say it worsens housing affordability.
But Beijing’s heavy-handed ways aren’t likely to solve the problem. Mainland cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen rank among the world’s most expensive housing markets despite state control. Those efforts also aren’t likely to satisfy the demonstrators, who are trying to defend their individual rights against Beijing’s growing sway over the city. Giving Beijing a bigger role in Hong Kong’s economy goes against the goal.
Through his foundation, Mr. Li has called the accusations against him “unwarranted,” and said he hoped that all parties would seek dialogue instead of inciting conflicts. His representative didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Chinese media has been less specifically aggressive with Victor Li, one of Mr. Li’s sons, who now runs the day-to-day operations of the Li empire. Richard Li, another son with his own property and telecommunications investments, took out ads opposing Hong Kong independence after the Chinese online community accused one of his companies of supporting a pro-independence pop singer.
Mr. Li’s career spans decades, and offers a glimpse at how the Communist Party’s view of business has changed over the years. He arrived in Hong Kong as a poor refugee fleeing Japanese forces during World War II. From that modest background, Mr. Li made a fortune through real estate, ports, telecommunications and utilities, earning the nickname “Superman” from admiring Hong Kongers.
Politically, Mr. Li’s instincts have long been strong. China’s state media lauded Mr. Li as a “patriot” for his philanthropic work in the mainland.
He met frequently with past Chinese leaders who were eager to show they supported the emerging class of Chinese business leaders. Deng Xiaoping, China’s paramount leader in the 1980s, held two one-on-one meetings with Mr. Li. Deng’s successor, Jiang Zemin, stayed at Mr. Li’s Harbor Grand Kowloon hotel during his three visits to the territory and had meals with him. Mr. Li has also met with Mr. Xi, when the future Chinese leader was a provincial official.
But Mr. Li in recent years has shown an independent streak just as the Communist Party began seeking greater control.
His company started selling off assets in the mainland and Hong Kong in 2013 as the property market became more uncertain. State media portrayed his retreat as lack of confidence in China’s economy. Two years later, a Chinese think tank controlled by state media published an article, headlined “Don’t Let Li Ka-shing Get Away With It,” that argued that Mr. Li should shoulder more social responsibility by helping the poor since he had made so much money in China through his political connections. Mr. Li then issued a three-page statement saying he wasn’t withdrawing from China.
Mr. Li has also demonstrated some political independence. He didn’t support the 2012 candidate whom Beijing picked for Hong Kong’s top leader. During the 2014 Umbrella Movement, a Xinhua News Agency article criticized him for not being “clear whether or not he agreed with the appeals of the protesters.”
During the latest round of protests, state media has again portrayed Mr. Li as ambivalent. It criticized the tone of newspaper ads he bought that called for peace on Hong Kong’s streets.
Then in September, at a Buddhist event in Hong Kong, Mr. Li said: “We hope the young people can take the big picture into consideration. For those at the helm, we hope they can give the masters of our future a way out.” A full-throated denunciation of the protesters it was not.
For others, the public pressure on Mr. Li sends a chilling message, said Chen Tianyong, an entrepreneur who left China and settled down in Malta this year after becoming disillusioned with the way Beijing managed the economy.
“If they can turn against Li Ka-shing so easily,” Mr. Chen said, “one can imagine what could happen to the rest of us.”

Dealing With China Isn’t Worth the Moral Cost,"We thought economic growth and technology would liberate China. Instead, it corrupted us.
The People’s Republic of China is the largest, most powerful and arguably most brutal totalitarian state in the world. It denies basic human rights to all of its nearly 1.4 billion citizens. There is no freedom of speech, thought, assembly, religion, movement or any semblance of political liberty in China. Under Xi Jinping, “president for life,” the Communist Party of China has built the most technologically sophisticated repression machine the world has ever seen. In Xinjiang, in Western China, the government is using technology to mount a cultural genocide against the Muslim Uighur minority that is even more total than the one it carried out in Tibet. Human rights experts say that more than a million people are being held in detention camps in Xinjiang, two million more are in forced “re-education,” and everyone else is invasively surveilled via ubiquitous cameras, artificial intelligence and other high-tech means.
None of this is a secret. Under Xi, China has grown markedly more Orwellian; not only is it stamping its heel more firmly on its own citizens, but it is also exporting its digital shackles to authoritarians the world over. Yet unlike the way we once talked about pariah nations — say East Germany or North Korea or apartheid South Africa — American and European lawmakers, Western media and the world’s largest corporations rarely treat China as what it plainly is: a growing and existential threat to human freedom across the world.
Why do we give China a pass? In a word: capitalism. Because for 40 years, the West’s relationship with China has been governed by a strategic error the dimensions of which are only now coming into horrific view.
[Farhad Manjoo answered your questions about this column  on Twitter .]
A parade of American presidents on the left and the right argued that by cultivating China as a market — hastening its economic growth and technological sophistication while bringing our own companies a billion new workers and customers — we would inevitably loosen the regime’s hold on its people. Even Donald Trump, who made bashing China a theme of his campaign, sees the country mainly through the lens of markets. He’ll eagerly prosecute a pointless trade war against China, but when it comes to the millions in Hong Kong who are protesting China’s creeping despotism over their territory, Trump prefers to stay mum.
Well, funny thing: It turns out the West’s entire political theory about China has been spectacularly wrong. China has engineered ferocious economic growth in the past half century, lifting hundreds of millions of its citizens out of miserable poverty. But China’s growth did not come at any cost to the regime’s political chokehold.
A darker truth is now dawning on the world: China’s economic miracle hasn’t just failed to liberate Chinese people. It is also now routinely corrupting the rest of us outside of China.
This was the theme of the N.B.A.’s hasty and embarrassing apology this week after Daryl Morey, the Houston Rockets’ general manager, tweeted — and quickly deleted — a message in support of Hong Kong’s protesters. After an outcry from American lawmakers, Adam Silver, the N.B.A.’s commissioner, later seemed to backtrack on his genuflection.
But I wasn’t comforted. The N.B.A. is far from the first American institution to accede to China’s limits on liberty. Hollywood, large tech companies and a variety of consumer brands — from Delta to Zara — have been more than willing to play ball. The submission is spreading: This week the American video game company Blizzard suspended a player for calling for the liberation of Hong Kong in a live-stream. And according to Deadspin, ESPN — a network owned by Disney, which has worked closely with the Chinese government on some big deals in China — warned anchors against discussing Chinese politics in talking about the Rockets controversy.
This sort of corporate capitulation is hardly surprising. For Western companies, China is simply too big and too rich a market to ignore, let alone to pressure or to police. If the first and most important cost of doing business in China is the surgical extraction of a C.E.O.’s spine, many businesses are only too happy to provide the stretcher and the scalpel.
But it will only get worse from here, and we are fools to play this game. There is a school of thought that says America should not think of China as an enemy. With its far larger population, China’s economy will inevitably come to eclipse ours, but that is hardly a mortal threat. In climate change, the world faces a huge collective-action problem that will require global cooperation. According to this view, treating China like an adversary will only frustrate our own long-term goals.
But this perspective leaves out the threat that greater economic and technological integration with China poses to everyone outside of China. It ignores the ever-steeper capitulation that China requires of its partners. And it overlooks the most important new factor in the Chinese regime’s longevity: the seductive efficiency that technology offers to effect a breathtaking new level of control over its population.
There was a time when Westerners believed that the internet would be the Communist regime’s ruin. In a speech in 2000 urging Congress to normalize trade relations with China, President Bill Clinton famously quipped: “There’s no question China has been trying to crack down on the internet. Good luck! That’s sort of like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall.” The crowd of foreign policy experts erupted in knowing laughter.
China proved them wrong. It didn’t just find a way to nail Jell-O; it became a Jell-O master carpenter. Through online surveillance, facial recognition, artificial intelligence and the propagandistic gold mine of social media, China has mobilized a set of tools that allow it to invisibly, routinely repress its citizens and shape political opinion by manipulating their feelings and grievances on just about any controversy.
This set of skills horrifies me. China may not be exporting its political ideology, but through lavish spending and trade, it is expanding its influence across the planet. There is a risk that China’s success becomes a kind of template for the world. In the coming decades, instead of democracy — which you may have noticed is not having such a hot run on either side of the Atlantic — Chinese-style tech-abetted surveillance authoritarianism could become a template for how much of the world works.
I should say there were a couple of small reasons for optimism regarding the spread of Chinese tyranny. The bipartisan outrage over the N.B.A.’s initial apology to China did suggest American lawmakers aren’t willing to give China a completely free pass. The Trump administration also did something clever, placing eight Chinese surveillance technology companies and several police departments on a blacklist forbidding them from trading with American companies.
But if we are to have any hope of countering China’s dictatorial apparatus, we’ll need a smarter and more sustained effort from our leaders. I’m not holding my breath.

‘The Beacon Has Gone Out’: What Trump and Giuliani Have Wrought,"KIEV, Ukraine — In 2014, Ukraine’s wildly corrupt president, Viktor Yanukovych, fled to Russia after mass protests on the Maidan, Kiev’s central square. During what Ukrainians call the Revolution of Dignity, police snipers killed dozens of demonstrators. In the revolution’s aftermath, a number of young idealists decided to plunge into politics, hoping to reform their troubled country from the inside. One of them was Serhiy Leshchenko, at the time perhaps the country’s most famous investigative journalist.
The American political scientist Francis Fukuyama had encouraged Leshchenko and some of his friends to run for Parliament. He’d met Leshchenko in 2013, when the journalist took part in a three-week summer course run by Fukuyama at Stanford that aims to teach activists from around the world about building democratic institutions. “After the Maidan revolution, I thought that it was particularly important that all these people in civil society actually go into the government,” Fukuyama said.
Many of them did. That October, Leshchenko, a lanky, bearded hipster with a passion for rave culture, became part of a cadre of Western-oriented newcomers elected to Parliament, even as he continued to work as a journalist exposing corruption. This year, after Volodymyr Zelensky won the presidential election, Leshchenko advised him during the transition.
Then Rudy Giuliani began attacking Leshchenko as a conspirator against America.
In 2016, Leshchenko had helped expose the “black ledger,” an accounting book of hundreds of pages found in Yanukovych’s former party headquarters. Among its many entries, it showed $12.7 million in secret payments to Paul Manafort. At the time, Manafort was running Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, but before that, he was one of Yanukovych’s most important advisers.
One of the reasons Manafort is in federal prison is that he failed to disclose or pay taxes on millions of dollars from Ukraine. But if you believe Giuliani, the black ledger was part of a plot to damage Trump.
During a Fox News appearance on May 10, Giuliani described the ledger as a “falsely created book” and Leshchenko as part of a group of “enemies of the president, in some cases enemies of the United States.” Last month, in an epic, ranting interview on CNN, he accused Ukraine’s leading anti-corruption organization, the Anti-Corruption Action Center, or AntAC, of developing “all of the dirty information that ended up being a false document that was created in order to incriminate Manafort.”
In Giuliani’s fevered alternative reality, Ukraine’s most stalwart foes of corruption are actually corruption’s embodiment. Deeply compromised figures with vendettas against the activists — particularly the ex-prosecutors Viktor Shokin and Yuriy Lutsenko — are transformed into heroes.
This addled, through-the-looking glass fantasy came to drive American foreign policy in Ukraine. Trump withdrew the American ambassador to the country, Marie Yovanovitch, whom reformers saw as their champion. He withheld military aid that Ukraine desperately needed, while asking Zelensky to do him a “favor” and investigate deranged fictions about Ukrainian interference in American elections, as well as Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.
Given how much Ukraine depends on American support, Giuliani’s smears made it politically impossible for Leshchenko, who left Parliament in August, to continue advising Zelensky. Now, with Ukraine at the center of a world-historical international scandal, he is stupefied to find himself defamed by powerful forces in the United States, once the world’s strongest backer of those fighting for democracy in his country.
“I could imagine that maybe some Ukrainian prosecutors will create a fake case against me, or some criminals will attack me, or I could be attacked by trolls on social media,” Leshchenko told me when I met him in a Kiev cafe. “But I never imagined before that my real problems will appear because of the statement of the personal attorney of the American president.”
If America can be said to have a foreign policy at this debased stage of the Trump administration, it mostly consists of sucking up to strongmen while betraying everyone who ever believed in America’s putative ideals. Trump has given Turkey his blessing to assault the Syrian Kurds, America’s crucial allies against ISIS. In June, he reportedly promised China that he wouldn’t speak out in favor of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, some of whom have been carrying American flags, as long as trade talks progressed.
Here in Ukraine, a country locked in a proxy war with Russia, coping with a deluge of disinformation and propaganda and struggling to transcend a history of corruption, reformers are trying to figure out what it means when the American president sides against them.
[ Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
Pro-Western reformers, the Ukrainian philosopher Volodymyr Yermolenko told me, had seen the United States as a “a perfect democracy functioning very well,” with an admirable system of checks and balances. “And now this image is crumbling and that’s very dangerous.”
The Ukrainians I spoke to aren’t naïve; they understand that America, like any other country, generally acts from self-interest rather than high principle. But there was a time when America at least viewed the projection of democratic values as being in its self-interest. That gave liberals in countries like Ukraine leverage against recalcitrant officials.
“The majority of the reforms, especially on anti-corruption, were passed because there was a very strong demand from civil society, and there was the I.M.F. and the U.S. Embassy pushing it hard,” said Oleksandra Ustinova, a former board member of AntAC who was elected to Parliament this year.
The U.S. also provided a degree of protection to local activists and journalists. When Lutsenko was prosecutor general in Ukraine — a position roughly equivalent to our attorney general — he would, said Ustinova, harass anti-corruption campaigners with spurious criminal investigations. “The U.S. ambassador and the E.U. ambassador were going out publicly saying you cannot do this,” Ustinova said.
Now that’s all changed. As The New York Times reported, after Trump recalled the U.S. ambassador, Lutsenko gloated to the head of AntAC that he had “eliminated your roof,” using Russian mafia slang for guardian.
“We’ve been exporting our corruption to them, rather than trying to export good governance,” said Fukuyama.
When he said that, Fukuyama may not have known how right he was. A few hours after I met Leshchenko, news broke that two Ukrainian-born clients of Giuliani, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, had been arrested on charges of campaign finance crimes as they were preparing to leave the United States with one-way tickets.
According to an indictment, the two “sought to advance their personal financial interests and the political interests of at least one Ukrainian government official with whom they were working.” (In one of those preposterously on-the-nose details that make the Trump era feel like a computer simulation on the fritz, Parnas had a company called Fraud Guarantee.)
As soon as news of the indictment broke, I messaged Leshchenko, who guessed that the unnamed Ukrainian official was Lutsenko. It was a natural assumption; it had already been reported that Parnas and Fruman connected Giuliani with Lutsenko, who had been feeding Trump’s lawyer conspiracy theories about the journalist, the former American ambassador and Joe Biden.
Sure enough, on Saturday NBC News reported that Lutsenko was the official in the indictment. Yovanovitch might have been referring to Lutsenko when she said, in her Friday congressional testimony, that “individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.”
Thanks to Giuliani’s escapades, the domestic grudges of a crooked Ukrainian prosecutor have blossomed into a scandal that’s likely to lead to the impeachment of an American president. Federal prosecutors are now investigating whether Giuliani himself broke the law.
Lutsenko has since left Ukraine for London, and Ukrainian authorities have opened a criminal case against him for allegedly abusing his authority in an unrelated matter. In a recent interview, he told reporters for The Times that in speaking to Giuliani, he sought to tell Trump’s lawyer what he wanted to hear. “I understood very well what would interest them,” Lutsenko said, adding, “I have 23 years in politics.”
He should be seen as wholly discredited, but in our polarized, frenzied media environment, lies never really go away. Trump’s defenders will continue to take Lutsenko’s stories at face value. Worse, long after America has forgotten them, these slanders, which Trump and Giuliani magnified to gargantuan scale, will linger in Ukraine, undermining the people our country once sought to help.
“This smear campaign circulates everywhere: in American media, then in Ukrainian media,” said Leshchenko. Those in Ukraine who want impunity for corruption, he said, can now say, “Look at these anti-corruption activists and journalists and members of Parliament. They are not welcome in the U.S., so don’t listen to them. So it suppresses our reputation here in Ukraine as well.”
Ukrainians are no strangers to post-truth politics. The first time I ever heard the term “fake news” was in 2015, when I learned about the Ukrainian fact-checking organization StopFake. It was created by a group of journalists to push back against the torrents of Russian disinformation sowing chaos in the country’s politics. At the time, it would have been hard to imagine that the United States would soon join Russia as a source of weaponized untruth in Ukraine.
“This is very new, because now it seems it’s not only Russia influencing Ukrainian politics, but Ukraine is also influencing the U.S., and things happening in the U.S. are greatly influencing Ukraine,” Yevhen Fedchenko, one of StopFake’s founders, told me. “So it becomes much more complicated.”
Here’s what’s not complicated. Throughout our history, America has committed many sins against democracy around the world, but we used to be on the right side in Ukraine. Not anymore. As one former U.S. diplomat said to me recently, “The beacon has gone out.” We’re with the oligarchs now.

Hong Kong Protesters Are Fueled by a Broader Demand: More Democracy,"HONG KONG — When hundreds of thousands of people in Hong Kong peacefully took to the streets last month, they had a few specific demands, including the withdrawal of an unpopular bill and an investigation into police abuse. In recent days, they added another call: the right to direct elections.
This latest demand brought into focus the issue that has been quietly seething at the heart of the protests: Hong Kong’s increasingly fraught relationship with mainland China and the authoritarian ruling Communist Party.
That longstanding anxiety flared last week when a small group of demonstrators stormed the city’s legislature, blacked out the name for mainland China from Hong Kong’s official emblem and spray-painted slogans calling for universal suffrage.
It was a dramatic rebuke of a political system that protesters say created a ruling class that has become more beholden to Beijing than to Hong Kong since the former British colony’s return to Chinese rule 22 years ago. The protesters’ forceful charging of the legislature brought this anger so jarringly to the fore that even a few members of the pro-establishment camp have urged the government in recent days to revisit steps toward political reforms.
The city’s embattled leader, Carrie Lam, asserted on Tuesday that the bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China was “dead” and would not be revived. But she also acknowledged that the protests were driven by broader problems dating to a failed 2014 pro-democracy movement that sought genuine, freer elections.
On Sunday, when tens of thousands of protesters once again urged the government to fully withdraw the bill, they also called for the legislature to be dismissed and for free elections.
“Mainland China worries us the most,” said Patrick Luk, 37, an administrative staffer at a community college who joined the protest with his wife and 5-year-old son. That is why, he said, universal suffrage is his most important priority.
“They force people to adhere to their doctrines,” Mr. Luk added, referring to the Communist Party. “They want us to be faithful to them.”
The protests were piling pressure on Mrs. Lam, and a few pro-establishment politicians have called for a shake-up of her senior advisers. Mrs. Lam has suspended the bill indefinitely but not fully withdrawn it, and in a briefing with reporters on Tuesday did not indicate any willingness to make further concessions.
Asked if she would restart political reforms to give the people of Hong Kong universal suffrage, Mrs. Lam sidestepped the question, but acknowledged that there were “fundamental deep-seated problems” that could be related to the economy, cost of living or politics.
Protesters and pro-democracy lawmakers want to protect the high degree of autonomy Hong Kong was promised when it was returned to China in 1997 under a policy known as “one country, two systems.” That autonomy is guaranteed until 2047, but the Communist Party and its security apparatus have increasingly encroached on the territory.
The last sustained protest movement demanding a direct say in the election of the territory’s chief executive ended in failure in 2014. Since then, Beijing has intervened to remove six politicians elected to Hong Kong’s legislature, a major setback for the opposition. Several others were disqualified from running in local elections by officials who questioned the sincerity of their belief that Hong Kong is an “inalienable part” of China.
As a result, protesters and experts say, the political playing field is so far out of balance that many of Hong Kong’s youth have felt shut out, and blame the generations of politicians before them for compromising their futures for the sake of seeking Beijing’s favor.
The experts and protesters say this may help explain why, when those frustrations boiled over at the legislature last week, many others in the movement remained sympathetic, seeing it as a culmination of years of pent-up anger.
“At first, I was shocked by their behavior too, but then I understood,” said Candy Wong, 56, a dentist and mother of two who joined a rally of thousands of parents on Friday to express support for the protesters.
“Those young people are not rioters,” Ms. Wong added. “They have tried everything else to make the government listen, but nothing has worked.”
Some politicians in the pro-establishment camp, possibly with an eye on future elections, have also spoken out about the need for the government to tackle the political structure that is the root cause of the protesters’ anger.
Jasper Tsang, a former president of the Legislative Council and a founding member of the largest pro-Beijing party in Hong Kong, turned heads last week when he raised the possibility of revisiting the debate over political reform.
“One of the main reasons there is so much anger is that the Hong Kong people, especially the youth, haven’t been given any hope for universal suffrage,” Mr. Tsang told HK01, a local news site.
Ronny Tong, a lawyer and member of the chief executive’s top advisory body, the Executive Council, echoed that suggestion.
“If the current difficulty in some way is caused by a failure of political reform, then we should consider bringing back political reform,” Mr. Tong said in an interview. He added that if the democratic lawmakers agreed to talk without any preconditions, he could “guarantee that the Hong Kong government would be willing to do just that.”
Samson Yuen, an assistant professor of political science at Lingnan University in Hong Kong who studies local social movements, said most protesters agreed that Hong Kong needed more democracy but that some were concerned it could distract from the movement’s more achievable demands.
“There have been a lot of splits even within the protesters regarding whether people should shift their demands to asking for democracy because that’s not what this movement is for,” Mr. Yuen said.
There is also the question of what political reform would even look like. Beijing once offered a form of direct elections that would have allowed the public to elect Hong Kong’s chief executive from a slate of two or three preapproved candidates.
But pro-democracy legislators voted down the measure in 2015, and Beijing’s supporters in the legislature said then that the Communist Party was unlikely to offer more generous terms. Since then, Hong Kong has continued to rely on a 1,200-member committee heavily weighted in Beijing’s favor to pick its chief executive.
In an editorial on Monday, the pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Wen Wei Po dismissed the calls for universal suffrage as irrelevant and having no legal basis. The paper argued that no city leader or government would “be able to, or have the authority to” agree to such a demand.
Last week, Lau Siu-kai, vice chairman of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, a semiofficial research institute with ties to Beijing, told a Hong Kong broadcaster that any debate on political reform would only “further divide society.”
The way to resolve the issue is to improve the government’s communication with the public, Mr. Lau and others said.
“None of our leaders have been able to articulate a vision of our future under ‘one country, two systems’ which has been inspiring to our young people,” said Regina Ip, a pro-establishment lawmaker and another member of the Executive Council.
Calls for political reforms are likely to be rejected by the Chinese leadership under Xi Jinping, who has strengthened authoritarian controls across China since coming to power in 2012, experts said.
Mr. Xi has already made an extraordinary concession to the protesters by allowing Mrs. Lam to suspend the bill, said Ma Ngok, an associate professor of government at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. So the chances that Mr. Xi would agree to political reforms, Mr. Ma said, are slim.
“Given that the entire country is still well on the road to full autocratic rule,” Mr. Ma said, “it’s unlikely they would initiate any kind of liberalization in Hong Kong.”

"Tanks, Missiles and No Pigeons: China to Celebrate 70th Birthday of the People’s Republic","BEIJING — Enormous flower arrangements in Beijing extol the signature promise of China’s leader to realize the Chinese Dream. Red banners urge people to “rally closer” to the Communist Party with “Comrade Xi Jinping at its core.” The authorities have restricted live entertainment venues, ordered people to vacate apartments and banned flying kites, sky lanterns and even homing pigeons, a charming feature of many neighborhoods.
As the Communist Party of China prepares to celebrate the 70th anniversary of its rule, the state is choreographing the pomp and pageantry to exalt President Xi as the unassailable leader of a rising nation and the indispensable bulwark against an array of challenges that threaten to erode its iron grip on power.
On Tuesday, the country’s National Day, he will preside over a military parade through Tiananmen Square whose preparations appear as ambitious and, arguably, as grandiose as the leader himself. It will involve 15,000 soldiers and sailors, 160 fighter jets, bombers and other aircraft, and 580 tanks and other weapons — some of them, military commanders hinted coyly, never before seen in public.
For Mr. Xi, the anniversary has come at an opportune, and much-needed, moment. It has given him a chance to bask in the party’s achievements at a time when it is coming under increasing strain, especially from the economic drag of the trade war with the United States. It is also fending off condemnation of the government’s mass detentions of Muslims in Xinjiang; battling an epidemic of African swine fever that has driven up prices for that Chinese staple, pork; and trying to contain months of protests in Hong Kong that have surged into an open defiance of Beijing’s rule.
“The republic is built by each brick and tile like this,” Mr. Xi said on Wednesday after riding an express train 25 miles south from the city center to inaugurate Beijing’s new international airport, one of the mega-projects that China has built as an affirmation of its political and economic greatness. The airport, with seven runways and a star-shaped terminal by the famed Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid, is set to be the world’s largest.
On the occasion of a simple ribbon cutting, he sought to channel the spirit of the founding of the People’s Republic of China by quoting from one of Mao Zedong’s revolutionary war poems, “Loushan Pass,” about a battle in the mountains of Guizhou in 1935.
Idle boast the strong pass is a wall of iron
With firm strides we are crossing its summit
In seven years in office, Mr. Xi has successfully consolidated his power by purging rivals, crushing dissent and removing the constitutional limits on his power. He has made the party the arbiter of all aspects of Chinese life and urged greater ideological purity to gird the nation for what he repeatedly describes as a great and continuing struggle.
He has sought to amass power as great as any leader since Chairman Mao, and even, to the dismay of some critics, presumed to place himself beside Mao in the pantheon of China’s Communist leaders.
“Xi gets it that the story matters,” Timothy Cheek, a professor of Chinese history at the University of British Columbia, wrote in an email. “He is facing what the Soviet bloc faced in the 1980s: lack of belief in the professed values of the party in the face of obvious contractions and corruption.”
That failure is a lesson that Mr. Xi and other leaders have studied well. China has thrived in ways the Soviet Union did not, largely because it managed a transition to a kind of free-market capitalism that offered millions of Chinese greater material prosperity.
Sustaining that is now the greatest challenge facing Mr. Xi and the party. China’s growth has slowed to its weakest point in decades, as the trade war grinds on the economy and consumers pull back. While trade talks continue, President Trump has continued to lash out at China, calling it a “threat to the world.”
“The weak link is not the lack of democracy,” Mr. Cheek said of the foundations of the party’s power. “It is the prospect of an economic downturn, of a failure to deliver to the ordinary citizen.”
The expectation of protests in Hong Kong, the semiautonomous territory returned to Chinese sovereignty 22 years ago, has already created a counternarrative to the Communist Party’s birthday celebration. Around the world, the televised cuts from Tuesday’s military parade in Beijing — and fireworks in the evening — to another round of tear gas and gas bombs in Hong Kong seem inevitable.
[Read more on how the protests in Hong Kong   expose a generational rift  .]
National Day commemorates Oct. 1, 1949, when Mao appeared on the same balcony on the Gate of Heavenly Peace that Mr. Xi will on Tuesday and proclaimed the formation of the People’s Republic of China.
At the time, the civil war against the nationalists still raged, and the Communist Party had few resources to govern so large an impoverished and war-battered country. In one famous anecdote repeated by officials and state news media this past week, some of the 17 aircraft that took part in the first parade flew over Tiananmen Square a second time to make the air force seem bigger than it really was.
A military parade was held each National Day from 1949 to 1959, but the tradition lapsed during the darkest years of Mao’s reign, which included the Great Famine and the Cultural Revolution. It resumed in 1984, overseen by Deng Xiaoping, the leader who began the reforms that opened up China’s economy.
“National Day parades and celebrations are carefully designed to communicate the self-image the regime wants Chinese people and the world to see,” said Susan L. Shirk, an expert on China at the University of California, San Diego, who was in the bleachers on Tiananmen Square during the 35th anniversary.
The party then wanted to promote capitalist policies to a generation raised on communist ones, so the parade featured banners with slogans like “Time Is Money” and floats promising material comforts. One float carried a 20-foot-tall chicken, another a refrigerator stocked with cold beer.
“Today,” Ms. Shirk added, “China has become more of a national security state.”
The 40th anniversary fell only months after the massacre that put down the student-led democracy movement on Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. The parade went on, but without the military hardware, “apparently because Beijing residents had seen enough weaponry in recent months,” The Times’s correspondent at the time, Nicholas D. Kristof, wrote.
Tuesday’s parade will not be the biggest by the number of participants, military officials acknowledged at a briefing in Beijing this past week, but they emphasized it would include new weapons, all of them made in China, tested and ready to use.
Researchers scouring satellite photos of staging areas near Beijing have spotted a hypersonic drone and a new mobile intercontinental ballistic missile, the DF-41, which is capable of hurling multiple nuclear warheads toward any city in the United States.
The parade will showcase a military that is, according to foreign military analysts, more capable, more integrated and better equipped than at any point in Chinese history.
“In the past 70 years, the development and growth of the Chinese military is there for all to see,” the Defense Ministry’s spokesman, Senior Col. Wu Qian, said in the briefing, when asked if the display of weaponry was intended to send a message to potential adversaries. “We have neither the intention nor the need to flex muscle through military parades.”
He and the other officers emphasized the military’s obedience to the Communist Party leadership — as if it were in question — and its embrace of the military reorganization overseen in recent years by Mr. Xi, whose many titles include chairman of the Central Military Commission, despite some resistance in the ranks.
The preparations have transformed the city, turning it into a stage to glorify the country, the party and Mr. Xi himself. Nothing has been left to chance.
Even the troops involved are chosen not only according to physical standards — the male soldiers marching in formation should be 5 feet 9 to 6 feet 1 — but also for political ones, said Maj. Gen. Tan Min, executive deputy director of the Military Parade Joint Command and deputy chief of staff of the Central Theater Command.
They, too, face inconveniences. According to an article in The Global Times, troops were given disposable diapers to wear during rehearsals because there was no time allotted for bathroom breaks.
A salesman in Beijing, Zhang Sheng, said he very much looked forward to the parade. “I want to come on that day, but probably can’t because there are too many people.”
In fact, access to the parade is restricted to only those with passes. Mr. Zhang, 35, brought roller skates to ride along the parade route ahead of the festivities, but it was forbidden.

How Vladimir Putin Falls,"A dictator meets an opponent he can’t co-opt, corrupt, calumniate, cow or coerce.
The Russian human-rights lawyer Karinna Moskalenko once explained to me how Vladimir Putin’s machinery of repression works.
“It isn’t necessary to put all the businessmen in jail,” she said. “It is necessary to jail the richest, the most independent, the most well-connected. It isn’t necessary to kill all the journalists. Just kill the most outstanding, the bravest, and the others will get the message.”
Her conclusion: “Nobody is untouchable.”
That was in 2007, when Putin still cultivated an image as a law-abiding, democratically elected leader. But that fiction vanished long ago.
Boris Nemtsov, the leading opposition figure, was murdered in the shadow of the Kremlin in 2015. His successor in that role, Alexei Navalny, has been in and out of prison on various trumped-up charges, as well as the victim of repeated attacks by “unknown chemicals.” Others, like the Putin critic and ex-Parliament member Denis Voronenkov, have been gunned down in broad daylight in foreign cities.
So it’s little less than awe-inspiring to read Andrew Higgins’s profile in The Times of opposition activist Lyubov Sobol.
Sobol, 31, is a Moscow lawyer and Navalny associate who has spent years pursuing a graft investigation of Putin intimate Yevgeny Prigozhin, the oligarch indicted by the U.S. last year for sponsoring the troll factory that interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. Considering that journalists have been killed looking into Prigozhin’s other businesses, Sobol’s doggedness recalls Eliot Ness’s pursuit of Al Capone in “The Untouchables” — except, unlike Ness, she has no knife, no gun, no badge, no law, and no federal government to aid her.
Now she is at the forefront of protests that have rocked Russia this summer after the regime disqualified opposition candidates (including her) from running in Sunday’s municipal elections. Her husband has been poisoned. Assailants have smeared her with black goo. Police dragged her from her office. Only a law forbidding the imprisonment of women with young children has kept her out of jail.
“I am always asked whether I am afraid, and I know that I should say, ‘Yes, I am,’” she tells Higgins. But, she says, “I am a fanatical kind of personality and am not afraid. I have always been a fan of the idea of fairness and, since childhood, have hated to see the strong abuse the weak.”
When regimes like Putin’s realize they cannot co-opt, corrupt, calumniate, cow, or coerce their opponents, what usually comes next is a decision to kill them. The risk that this could happen to Sobol or Navalny is terrifyingly real, not least because Putin has so many underworld friends willing to do his presumptive bidding without asking for explicit orders.
But Putin also needs to beware. Dictatorships fall not only when they have implacable opponents but also exemplary victims: Steve Biko in South Africa, Benigno Aquino in the Philippines, Jerzy Popieluszko in Poland. Through their deaths, they awakened the living to the conviction that it was the regime that should die instead.
Today, Nemtsov continues to haunt the Kremlin. So do Sergei Magnitsky, Natalia Estemirova, Alexander Litvinenko and Anna Politkovskaya, to name just a few of the regime’s murdered adversaries. At some point, a growing list of victims will start to weigh heavily against Putin’s chances of staying in power. The death of a galvanizing opposition figure could be the tipping point.
Especially when the political-survival formula that has worked for Putin so far is coming unstuck. That formula — enrich your cronies, terrify your foes, placate the urban bourgeoisie with a decent standard of living, and propagandize everyone else with heavy doses of xenophobic nationalism — no longer works so well in an era of Magnitsky sanctions, international ostracism, a persistently stagnant economy, middling oil prices, unpopular pension reforms, and dubious foreign adventures.
It works even less well when your domestic foes aren’t so easily terrified. As in Hong Kong, a striking feature of the Russian protests is the extent to which they are youth-driven — a vote of no-confidence in whatever the regime is supposed to offer. One recent survey found that the number of young Russians who “fully trust” Putin fell to 19 percent this year, from 30 percent last year. That’s not a good trend line for a man who aspires to die on his throne.
None of this guarantees that Putin can’t bounce back, not least if Donald Trump gives him the kinds of breaks, like readmission into the G7, he needs. And Robert Mugabe’s death this week at 95 is a reminder that tyrants can endure longer than anyone expects.
Still, for the first time in 20 years, the elements by which Putin falls are coming into place. Core among them is the courage of people like Sobol — a woman who, as Pericles said more than 2,400 years ago, “knows the meaning of what is sweet in life and of what is terrible, and then goes out undeterred to meet what is to come.”

"As Hong Kong Erupted Over Extradition Bill, City’s Tycoons Waited and Worried","HONG KONG — Weeks before this semiautonomous city erupted in political chaos over a contentious extradition bill, more than 200 of its most powerful business leaders were summoned to the Chinese government’s headquarters here.
The message from Beijing: If you have worries about the bill, keep them to yourself.
And they did — until hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets. When the Chinese government appeared unsure how to react, and a later protest turned violent, business leaders were stirred into action. Deals were canceled. Money appeared to flee, raising concerns that Hong Kong could cede financial ground to Singapore. Within days, a handful of business leaders were publicly suggesting that the Hong Kong government should back down.
Public defiance forced the government to capitulate, in a stinging setback for the city’s ultimate masters in China. It also gave the business community cover to speak out.
[Thousands of protesters  surrounded Hong Kong government offices on Friday , further pressuring the city’s leaders.]
In interviews with The New York Times, more than a dozen top business and political leaders said that the city’s titans of commerce and finance had wrestled with when and how to act. They feared the extradition bill would expose them to the authoritarian arm of Beijing. But only when Beijing seemed to waver did they emerge to oppose it.
“If you do business in China, although you may have worries, when the absolute top leader asks for your support, what do you say?” said Michael Tien, a retail magnate and one of two pro-Beijing Hong Kong lawmakers to openly call for delaying the bill’s passage.
As the fight over Hong Kong’s future rages, its business leaders — once the city’s biggest power brokers — are in a position that is growing more precarious. China’s rise has enriched Hong Kong, but it has also emboldened Beijing to take a greater hand in the city’s affairs.
That stronger hand threatens Hong Kong’s future as a global commercial hub, but business leaders increasingly fear resisting a Chinese government that does not tolerate dissent.
Outside pressures also played a role in the business leaders’ speaking out. Local tycoons were spooked by rising threats by lawmakers in the United States to reconsider an American policy granting special trade status to Hong Kong, raising the prospect that the city could become another front in President Trump’s trade war with China.
Hong Kong, a former British colony, owes its rise to its position as the world’s bridge to China. It operates under its own laws, enjoying independent courts and wide freedom of expression. That has made it an ideal base for local billionaires and global companies to run their mainland businesses.
Those business types have long enjoyed tremendous power. They control roughly one-third of the seats of the Legislative Council, the city’s lawmaking body. A few tycoons own the property companies, utilities, supermarkets and other businesses central to everyday life.
Their support, or lack of it, has helped decide the fate of other political movements. A pro-business party effectively blocked a 2003 law that would have extended China’s national security apparatus into the city, resulting in the eventual ouster of Hong Kong’s top leader. By contrast, businesses harshly criticized the 2014 occupation of parts of the city by protesters opposing the mainland’s increasing sway in Hong Kong. The protest ultimately faltered.
The extradition bill drew immediate worry from the business community when it was submitted in February. The bill would make it possible for Hong Kong to extradite suspects to the mainland. In closed-door meetings, business leaders argued that it could make them vulnerable to charges of corruption in China, where bribery has long been seen as a cost of doing business but has become the target of a nationwide crackdown in the past few years.
“When we started to open up factories in China, the overall rule of law was not so mature,” said Felix Chung, a Legislative Council member and Liberal Party leader who represents the textiles and garment sector.
“A lot of things had to be done by special ways, through corruption, bribery or whatever,” said Mr. Chung, who opened his factory on the mainland in 1993.
In March, Mr. Chung and other Hong Kong business representatives met privately with John Lee, the top official at the city’s Security Bureau, which submitted the original bill, to express their concerns. After the meetings, the government narrowed the scope of the bill, easing the worries of some business owners, but bribery remained on the list of offenses that could lead to extradition.
Opposition built among local and international businesses. By the end of March, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong said that it still had “serious concerns” about the bill, adding that it would “reduce the appeal of Hong Kong to international companies considering Hong Kong as a base for regional operations.”
The Hong Kong offices of global multinational companies were flooded with emails and telephone calls from head offices worried about the implications of the legislation.
“It would apply to the accountants and the bankers who structure the loans to the corporate lawyers who advised on the various issues of the financing,” said Michael Vidler, a prominent lawyer in Hong Kong.
“All it would take is some breakdown in a business deal or someone not wanting to repay a loan with an entity in China with a high-placed official, and they would find themselves at the end of the extradition requests,” he said.
Chinese officials tried to quell dissent. On May 17, they summoned more than 200 pro-Beijing officials and business leaders to discuss the bill and seek support for the measure. A few days later, two of the most senior officials in the Chinese Communist Party, Han Zheng and Wang Yang, voiced their support.
With the date for lawmakers to approve the bill looming, the typically pro-establishment Hong Kong Law Society uncharacteristically called for the government to delay passage. The call from the society, which represents lawyers involved in a wide range of commercial transactions, helped to galvanize many ordinary citizens and small-business owners, to speak out in protest.
Four days later, on June 9, hundreds of thousands of people filled the streets of Hong Kong in one of the largest demonstrations in the city’s history.
China’s reaction was muted. The Foreign Ministry said it still supported the bill and criticized “foreign forces that interfere” in Hong Kong’s affairs. But local tycoons realized that Beijing had underestimated the local opposition.
The next day, Abraham Shek, a pro-Beijing lawmaker who is a director of Goldin Financial, a major real estate developer, demanded an urgent board meeting. Goldin Financial was on the verge of completing a hard-won deal to buy a $1.4 billion property at the site of Hong Kong’s old Kai Tak airport.
The board decided to abandon the deal, forfeiting $3.2 million as a penalty, citing “social contradiction and economic instability.”
Mr. Shek did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Goldin Financial said the company had no more to add.
“I think it was sensible,” Mr. Chung, the Liberal Party leader, said. “What if Hong Kong becomes a very unstable place with many demonstrations every week?” he added.
In the United States, Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed “deep concern” and suggested that Congress could reconsider the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act, which gives the city special status for customs and commercial purposes.
Still, Hong Kong’s leaders did not dare speak out publicly until after June 12, when tens of thousands of protesters surrounded the Legislative Council building, preventing lawmakers from debating the bill. Police officers fired tear gas and shot rubber bullets. Businesspeople watched the fray from their skyscraper windows.
The business world squirmed. A share sale worth more than $1 billion by the property developer ESR Cayman was postponed because of the instability, said a person with knowledge of the decision, who asked to speak anonymously because the discussions were private. ESR declined to comment.
A gauge of money supply in Hong Kong known as Hibor spiked that day to its highest point since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008, suggesting that some panicked investors might be pulling their money out of Hong Kong.
By Friday, Bernard Chan, president of a local insurer and a top government adviser, and Mr. Tien, a deputy to China’s national Parliament, urged a pause on the bill.
“After you had this many people in the streets and there were casualties, we did not want further escalation,” Mr. Chan said.
Carrie Lam, the city’s chief executive, met with pro-Beijing lawmakers and senior Chinese officials. Then, on Saturday, June 15, she said she would postpone the bill.
The battle over the bill is not over. Mrs. Lam or any successor could still push it through. But many people within Hong Kong’s business community hope that Beijing would see the value in addressing the concerns of people and companies.
“This incident revealed the true character of the Hong Kong people,” Mr. Tien said, “and sent a signal to China that if they really want to rule Hong Kong with stability and prosperity, they have to gain the hearts of the Hong Kong people.”

Private Surveillance Is a Lethal Weapon Anybody Can Buy,"The plan was simple: Give the government of Uzbekistan the ability to monitor everyone’s communications.
I first heard the story about five years ago from an American defense consultant. I had spoken to him over the years about arms sales, particularly those involving the former Soviet Union. He had been involved in overseeing foreign military sales for the American government before he went into the private sector, using his expertise to help broker deals around the world. In 2014, the market in Uzbekistan looked promising.
It was the same year that Human Rights Watch declared that “Uzbekistan’s human rights record remained abysmal across a wide spectrum of violations.” Islam Karimov, the country’s president at the time, reportedly boiled at least one of his enemies alive. The Uzbek government wanted to buy what is known in official parlance as “lawful interception,” and among privacy advocates as surveillance technology. The American company the defense consultant was working for was offering the Uzbeks technology to surveil cellphone and internet communications as well as fixed landlines.
A small team representing the American company went to Tashkent, the Uzbek capital, to meet with officials and tell them what they had to offer. “We don’t want to stop people from using the internet, we want to control it,” the American defense consultant said the Uzbek general in charge of the procurement told one of his colleagues.
It was by any measure a memorable trip. In the evening, the defense consultant and his colleagues walked around the city, taking in the modern luxury hotels and Soviet-era Brutalist architecture. Knowing the Uzbek government would monitor foreign visitors whom it suspected of being spies or involved in political activities, the group made sure to keep to the main streets, so it wouldn’t appear they were trying to do anything secretive. (There were even stranger aspects to the trip: At one point, the consultant recalled, the Uzbek hosts sent prostitutes to his group’s hotel; the women were turned away by hotel security.)
After the American defense consultant told me about the trip, I’d filed it away in my mental archive as one of those stories I often hear about the strange underbelly of the overseas defense market. But more than five years later, the type of technology he was selling has become more widespread, and more controversial.
High-tech surveillance technology, once the purview of sophisticated spy services in wealthy countries, is now being offered by private contractors around the world as part of a highly secretive multibillion-dollar industry.
In the past year, there have been at least two high-profile reports that authoritarian states have used Western surveillance technology intended to track down criminals and terrorists to spy on journalists or political activists: The United Arab Emirates company DarkMatter allegedly spied on journalists (a claim the company denies); the Saudi government has been accused of using spyware made by the Israeli firm NSO Group to hack into the phone of a close associate of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi writer killed in his country’s consulate in Istanbul last October. And in the United States, security researchers are raising the alarm that cheaper versions of this technology are being used and abused by private consumers.
While other kinds of weapons are subjected to stringent international regimes and norms — even if these are often broken — the trade in spy technology is barely regulated. The American defense consultant, who shared materials and details so long as I agreed not to use his name or the name of his company because it would endanger his professional contacts abroad, was quick to point out that nothing in what he was proposing in 2014 was illegal. It still isn’t.
But allowing this sort of technology to fall into the wrong hands can have the same impact as selling a lethal weapon. If you have a cellphone, “you are enabling your surveillance,” said Alec Ross, a senior adviser on innovation to Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state. “The capabilities of foreign intelligence services are only growing. This issue creates a body count.”
In the end, the company that the American defense consultant represented didn’t get the contract. He heard that the business went to an Israeli firm, though he had no way of knowing for sure — the government of Uzbekistan never posted the tender online, let alone announced the winner. But his assumption appears to be backed up by a 2015 report from Privacy International, a nongovernmental organization that tracks the export of surveillance technology, that said two companies operating from Israel had set up monitoring centers in Uzbekistan with the ability to intercept any phone, ensuring the “communications of every individual are within the reach of the security and law enforcement agencies.”
Uzbeks have given detailed accounts of their surveillance. Gulasal Kamolova, a journalist who fled Uzbekistan in 2015 and now lives in France, told Amnesty International that she believes her mobile phone has been under surveillance since 2008. She described how once, while she was still in Uzbekistan, she was contacted by an Uzbek security services officer who said, shortly after she received an international call: “You got a call from abroad. Who was calling?”
Ms. Kamolova worries that the Uzbek security service still tracks her number in France. She has reason to be concerned: The marketing material the American defense consultant’s company gave to the Uzbeks said the company could search for a phone user based on his unique “voice print,” regardless of what phone number he’s using, and to pinpoint his location. Another document described an option for “worldwide tracking of mobile phones.”
Did an Israeli surveillance company help intercept Ms. Kamolova’s call? It’s impossible to know because who gets what contracts is almost never public knowledge, and it is a complex business involving software companies, hardware vendors and even traditional telecoms.
Stephen E. Arnold, a former manager at Booz Allen Hamilton and a specialist in online systems for law enforcement and intelligence software, told me that most estimates of the value are “pure baloney,” and said creating a realistic estimate would require collecting data that most companies are loath to provide. One market research report claims that it could be worth $3.3 billion in the next few years; the NSO Group, which has been raising money, is more optimistic, saying the industry is valued at some $12 billion.
One thing is clear: The private surveillance industry is growing. A firm that creates a catalog of these technologies, once named the “Little Black Book of Electronic Surveillance,” changed the name in 2016 to the “Big BlackBook.” It had doubled in size in its first three years. The 2017 edition includes 150 vendors.
The genesis of this global spy bazaar can be traced back to the frenetic weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, when Congress rushed through the Patriot Act, a law that vastly expanded the American government’s wiretapping authorities. In the process, lawmakers inadvertently created a market for companies interested in providing services and technologies to collect and analyze the new trove of data.
In 2002, in a testament to the American entrepreneurial spirit, a company in McLean, Va., called TeleStrategies held the first ISS World conference, for companies interested in helping government authorities gather intelligence. The conference, labeled the “Wiretappers Ball” by critics, is now held several times a year in cities like Washington, Dubai, Prague, Panama City and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. (Jerry Lucas, who owns TeleStrategies, declined to comment on his company’s success. “I don’t make myself available to talk to the press about ISS World,” he told me.)
The technical discussions from those early days now almost seem quaint: The information that was collected was largely phone calls made through landlines and mobile phones, and emails. Over the next few years, the way people communicated changed drastically — first Facebook, then Skype, then the iPhone. Within a few years, billions of people were walking around with devices in their pocket that did everything from finding a date to tracking exercise habits.
“It used to be that if you wanted to look into somebody’s brain, you needed to talk to them or to physically follow them, or to pick them up and then torture them until they told you what was inside,” said Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights advocacy group. “Then it used to be all you had to do was install malware remotely on their computer. And even then, you had sort of a limited look inside their brain.
“Now everyone carries a tracking device around in their pocket, which also contains all of their messages, all of their contacts, basically a map of their friends, all of their photos. It is, she said, “essentially the inside of your brain.”
Surveillance tech companies quietly began to spring up in the United States and Europe; some were traditional telecoms that had long worked with government authorities to conduct lawful interception. Others were smaller start-ups.
One country in particular saw an opportunity in this emerging market: Israel. In 2010, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided he needed to jump-start his country’s cyberindustry, unrolling a series of measures to allow veterans of Israel’s version of the National Security Agency, known as Unit 8200, to create private businesses.
Speaking this year at a cybersecurity conference in Tel Aviv, Mr. Netanyahu said his inspiration dated back to the 1970s, when he was studying management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He saw a big “ugly warehouse” that he was told belonged to the C.I.A. or N.S.A. The future prime minister liked the potential in merging intelligence with academia, and creating a work force that could carry the technology into the private sector. “My idea was, why don’t we do that here?” he said.
But to do that, he said, he needed to make sure that there weren’t regulations holding the industry back. “There’s no industry more susceptible and more inviting of regulations than cybersecurity,” he said. “It’s like weapons — it is a weapon.”
In 2011, he established a special task force to help develop Israel’s private cyber industry and reduce “export impediments” on cybertechnology. Veterans of Unit 8200 and other parts of the Israeli military began to create businesses, many involved in defensive cybersecurity, but others went into offense, including several who created NSO Group, which is now one of the most prominent private spy tech companies. Rather than defending computer systems from attack, this new breed of offense-oriented companies would help hack into foreign systems.
The timing was auspicious. In 2011, popular uprisings fueled by social media and messaging apps swept the Arab world. Intelligence agencies everywhere wanted ways to monitor social media to see — and often stop — protests spreading.
Even then, knowledge about what these companies were offering, and what the governments were using, was highly restricted. But in May 2013, an intelligence contractor named Edward Snowden left for Hong Kong with a trove of top-secret material that detailed the N.S.A.’s global surveillance programs, including Prism, which gathers a vast amount of internet communications. These revelations changed the conversation about electronic surveillance overnight.
“I think those disclosures had the unintended effect of putting forth a kind of blueprint,” Ronald Deibert, the director of Citizen Lab, a cybersecurity watchdog group at the University of Toronto, told me. “In June 2013, you wake up and you read The Guardian report about Prism; first thing I would do is turn to my security chief and say, ‘How do I get myself one of those?’”
Few countries have the resources to build or buy a program like Prism, but they can afford the services of NSO Group. Around the time of the Snowden revelations, a shift was happening: By 2013, about one-third of the companies at the Wiretappers Ball were from “non-Western countries,” including China, India, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, according to a 2013 interview Mr. Lucas gave to Mr. Arnold, the former Booz Allen manager.
In the fall of 2012, an Ethiopian dissident who had been living in the United States for more than two decades opened an email attachment. The Word document, written in his native Amharic, admonished him for his political activities. “If you are not willing to cooperate with us, you should know that you will suffer from continuous and major attack,” it read.
The spyware even swept up the web search history of his ninth-grade son.
In reality, the document was the attack: an embedded macro — unseen bits of computer code — covertly installed a spyware program called FinSpy on his computer. The spyware, which is made by Gamma Group, an Anglo-German company, can record every keystroke, call or text on an infected device. It can even secretly record audio using the computer’s built-in microphone. For several months, according to security experts who later conducted a forensic analysis of his computer, his activity was sent back to a server in Ethiopia.
The spyware transmitted dozens of his Skype and internet phone calls, copies of emails, and even swept up the web search history of his ninth-grade son. He never knew this spyware was operating in the background of his computer until he was approached by Ms. Galperin of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who suspected he was being monitored.
In 2014, the foundation sued the Ethiopian government for illegal wiretapping on behalf of the dissident, an American-Ethiopian dual citizen. The goal of the suit, according to Ms. Galperin, was to set a legal precedent that could be used to place limits on the spyware market. Unconvinced that new export regulations would work, Ms. Galperin and her team hoped that the American court system could.
They lost the suit. But Ms. Galperin still believes the legal system offers one of the best tools for holding people and governments accountable for spying. Her organization is looking for a new case to try again: “The wheels of justice move slowly, and the wheels of impact litigation move even slower,” she said.
Around the same time, momentum was building in calls for further regulation of the private spy industry.
In 2015, Hacking Team, an Italian company that markets software to remotely break into and monitor people’s electronic devices, was itself hacked. Five years’ worth of the company’s internal emails and documents were posted online, revealing that Hacking Team had marketed its product to authoritarian countries including Syria and Azerbaijan — and that Italian export laws didn’t forbid such activity.
The mounting outrage over these sorts of sales increased support for reforms proposed by Britain and France to the Wassenaar Arrangement, the pact signed by more than 40 countries, including the United States, that helps determine what sort of dual-use and weapons technologies are regulated.
Among the new proposals was an attempt to include surveillance technology, such as spyware, in that pact. The changes wouldn’t prohibit companies from selling surveillance technology; they would simply have required signatories to regulate it in some manner. In the United States, this translated initially into a proposal to require export licenses for surveillance software. Other Wassenaar members, including the European Union, moved forward fitfully with regulations, but for a variety of reasons, the United States’ proposed changes have languished.
So far, no one has come up with a good solution for how to regulate this industry. If anything, there’s evidence that the private spies have been emboldened. At a recent arms show in Abu Dhabi, WiSpear, a surveillance company, was openly advertising a mobile surveillance system fit for a Hollywood villain: a black van equipped with a suite of equipment that the company claims can spy on a phone several hundred meters away. Customers can also buy a drone to hack phones. WiSpear, which is registered in Cyprus, was founded by a former Israeli intelligence official who sold his last company to NSO Group.

Even those who work in cybersecurity believe the industry requires oversight. “I think it needs to be better regulated — primarily in Europe and Asia, since that’s where companies like Hacking Team and these other sketchy shops operate from,” said Jason Syversen, a former Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency official and onetime hacker who later founded his own cybersecurity firm. But what to do is another question. “I’m not sure what the right answer is though, because it’s such a complicated, nuanced area,” he said. “And politicians suck at complex, nuanced technical topics.”
Mr. Snowden, whose revelations helped shine light on the technology that fuels this market, offers a radical proposal: ban private spyware. “The commercial trade in software vulnerabilities and exploits produces little public value and extraordinary public harms, particularly in that it establishes a transient mercenary class of digital saboteurs that are as happy working for the Saudis and the Chinese as they are for the French,” he wrote in a message to me recently.
An outright ban may sound drastic, but Mr. Snowden’s underlying concerns are being proved out. In the latest twist of the spy market, DarkMatter, the United Arab Emirates-based cybercompany, which has employed former American intelligence employees, has reportedly targeted American citizens. The allegations appear to confirm longstanding fears that Western technology would eventually be used against citizens of those countries that it was supposed to protect.
Even more worrisome is the possibility that sophisticated spyware of the type marketed by companies like NSO Group and Gamma Group, which today is sold only to governments, could make its way to private users. Kate Moussouris, the chief executive of the cybersecurity company Luta Security, says this is already happening with products like FlexiSPY, which can be purchased by anyone for as little as $68. The maker of FlexiSPY says it can secretly “turn on the phone’s microphone and record its surroundings” and “spy on SMS, emails and photos.”
Intelligence gathering systems should be treated by the American government like what they are: weapons.
FlexiSPY is more basic technology than what is offered by NSO Group and similar companies, and it requires physical access to the targeted device to install the software. But as the commercial technology for private users evolves, it’s likely to pose some of the same dangers as today’s more professional spyware. And if individual users can buy versions of this type of spy technology, what about multinational corporations, drug cartels or terrorist groups?
A comprehensive solution for regulating private espionage is hard to imagine (though perhaps still easier to imagine than wiping out an entire industry, as Mr. Snowden suggests). But that doesn’t mean that there aren’t clear first steps to rein in the global spy industry.
Intelligence-gathering systems should be treated by the American government like what they are: weapons. And weapons require export licenses from the State Department. This move would require carefully carving out broad exemptions to cover security researchers and academics.This may not guarantee that exports won’t ever go to countries with spotty records, like Saudi Arabia, but it provides a stronger basis for Congress or the State Department to block them. It would also require pressuring allies — including Germany, Italy and Israel — to follow suit on allowing sales only to countries that respect human rights.
This would require a shift in thinking not likely to take place under the Trump administration, which has trumpeted its record-setting arms sales to Saudi Arabia. And while changing the export laws wouldn’t have a direct impact on American companies that sell software to domestic consumers, classifying this technology as a weapon would make the case for regulations within the United States stronger as well.
Regulating the export of weapons has long been a messy, and imperfect, endeavor. Academics will worry about the impact on research, American businesses will complain that regulations benefit competitors like China, and human rights advocates will point out that the State Department regularly allows weapons sales to dictatorships.
But labeling something as a weapon may be the only way to acknowledge that technology used to surveil your most intimate communications is, in fact, part of a new arms race.
The American defense consultant is not coldblooded, but he is practical. The proposed sale to Uzbekistan was legal, and in his mind, ethical. The Uzbeks “understood, when you play with other countries, you’ve got to follow their rules,” he said. “The Israelis offered to actually hack into stuff. They were into breaking stuff. We were doing lawful intercept, front door.”
He told me he believed that the technology he was marketing would help keep Uzbekistan safe. The company’s marketing material explains the system’s “warrant management” system to ensure a wiretap is legal. And even Steve Swerdlow, a researcher for Human Rights Watch who focuses on Central Asia, said that while he was concerned about Uzbekistan’s abuse of such technology, the government could have legitimate uses for surveillance systems, including stopping jihadist terrorism.
“We’ve always said the Uzbek government has a right to defend itself,” he said. “But for a long time, the specter of an Islamic takeover was used as cover for serious political repression.”
Those who have worked in or around the lawful intercept business view the world in terms of Western national security interests, not human rights. It is up to Western governments to decide who can, or cannot, buy technology.
“It’s kind of a shame they didn’t get to help spy on everyone’s web traffic,” the American defense consultant joked of his company’s would-be Uzbek contract. But he still defended the proposal. The Uzbeks “didn’t want to do anything funny, they wanted to play by the rules,” he told me when I asked him if he, or the company, ever had any hesitation about trying to sell to Uzbekistan. “I’ll even bet they had judges sign off” on wiretaps, he said.
He paused briefly before adding, in a moment of reflection: “In the Soviet Union, everything was approved by a judge. They had everything done legally.”

"1, 2, 3, 4, Trump Can’t Rule Us Anymore","With impeachment looming, it’s time to take to the streets again.
All over the world right now, outraged citizens are taking to the streets. Mass protests in Hong Kong have been going on for months, at one point drawing about a quarter of the territory’s population. For the last five days, hundreds of thousands of people have been marching against austerity and corruption in Lebanon, and the government has pushed through a package of reforms to address their grievances. In Chile, protests over a subway fare increase have exploded into a broader uprising against inequality.
These demonstrations are part of a global trend. “There has been in this decade a real rise in the use of mass protests in particular as a way to address grievances against governments around the world,” said Erica Chenoweth, a Harvard professor and co-author of “Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict.” In fact, she said, in the last 10 years there have been more mass demonstrations calling for the removal of political leaders than in any decade since 1900.
So as Donald Trump’s sneering lawlessness and stupefying corruption continue to escalate, it’s confounding, at least to me, that Americans aren’t taking to the streets en masse. This presidency began with the biggest protest in American history, and its first two years were marked by a series of high-profile demonstrations. But three years in, even as the conviction that Trump threatens the Republic unites stolid military heroes and socialist feminists, demonstrations against the administration have faded. Lyndon Johnson was famously tormented by protest chants that could be heard through the walls of the White House. Why isn’t Trump?
[ Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
Organizers and experts offer both optimistic and pessimistic explanations for Americans’ relative quiescence. Let’s start with pessimism: Some people are burned out. In her book “American Resistance: From the Women’s March to the Blue Wave,” Dana Fisher, a professor at the University of Maryland, described how a series of “moral shocks” propelled people who hadn’t thought of themselves as activists to join protests. But after three years of Trumpism, it takes more to shock people than it used to. “People have grown accustomed to a certain baseline level of outrage,” Fisher told me.
But that’s far from the whole story. Fisher surveyed people at the Women’s March and other demonstrations, and then tracked them afterward, doing follow-up surveys six months before the midterms and two days after. “All of their levels of civic engagement went up,” she said.
Many had called elected officials and attended town halls. Now, she says, much of the Resistance is focused on organizing for presidential candidates, particularly Elizabeth Warren. “One of the reasons we’re seeing less protest is that protest is being seen as the beginning of activism and political involvement rather than being the end,” she said.
So if America isn’t seeing the sort of huge demonstrations roiling other countries, it’s at least in part because those most fiercely opposed to Trump still believe in the power of our democracy to get rid of him. “People actually trust the election to sort it out,” said Chenoweth. “This is something that’s common in democracies — when you start to see a protest wave really pick up, a lot of time that mobilization really gets filtered into the next election.”
But the next election is a year away, and American democracy is in danger now. You can’t count on an election to restrain the president when the president is using the power of his office to subvert the election with foreign interference. Each day, it seems, Trump and those around him become increasingly brazen in their lawbreaking.
The president’s re-election campaign is selling T-shirts that say, “Get Over It,” which is what the acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said after admitting on national television to Trump’s quid pro quo with Ukraine. Trump associates are blithely defying congressional subpoenas. With the staffers who used to at least try to restrain the president long gone, he’s testing the limits of his authority. And he’s retreating only in the face of bipartisan public fury, as he did when he backed off his plan to hold next year’s G7 at the Trump National Doral, his failing Florida resort.
As the impeachment investigation closes in, Trump will continue to act out. That’s why a growing number of people — many of them more temperate than I am — have started calling for mass protest in response.
Organizers are brainstorming how to make this happen. “Our experience has been that the most successful mobilization moments have some kind of trigger or flash point,” said Leah Greenberg, a co-founder of the anti-Trump organization Indivisible. “The place that we have agreed as a movement to make that next flash point mobilization moment is going to be around the House vote.”
Once the House votes to send articles of impeachment to the Senate, there needs to be a public groundswell to force the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to allow a thorough and transparent trial. Then, assuming the evidence is as compelling as it seems, there should be mass nonviolent action calling for Trump’s removal.
Americans might feel that democracy in our country is more robust than in places disrupted by enormous protests. But at this dangerous phase of a dangerous presidency, enormous turnout in the streets may be the only way to make sure it stays that way.

"After Rebuking Daryl Morey, Rockets Owner Stays Quiet","Tilman Fertitta, the owner of the Houston Rockets, had never been shy about politics. Then China happened.
For Tilman Fertitta, the billionaire restaurant magnate, host of the CNBC television show “Billion Dollar Buyer” and owner of the N.B.A.’s Houston Rockets, silence is unusual.
Yet, he has been mostly silent publicly since his Oct. 4 social media rebuke of Daryl Morey, his basketball team’s general manager, after Morey expressed support for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong with a post on Twitter. With his team getting set to play preseason games in Japan, Fertitta quickly distanced himself — not from the authoritarian Chinese government, but from his widely admired executive.
His statement was simple: Morey had gone rogue.
“Listen....@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization,” Fertitta wrote.
Then the mixed messages began. Fertitta told ESPN all was well with Morey and him, but around the same time, he began liking posts on Instagram supportive of Morey’s firing.
And then he went quiet.
In his first public comments since the interview with ESPN, Fertitta, whose team opens the season on Thursday night against Milwaukee, agreed to provide written answers to questions through a spokeswoman. He said he “never considered firing or punishing Daryl” in the wake of Morey’s Twitter post. Fertitta also said that he needed to initially distance the Rockets from Morey because, “I felt it was important to make the distinction between Daryl speaking as a private citizen and Daryl as a representative of the Houston Rockets.”
He added, “We have never commented on another country’s foreign policy.”
Then it was back to silence. Fertitta declined to answer several follow-up questions, including whether he wished he had handled anything differently since Morey’s post. The Rockets said Morey was not available for comment.
Having the Rockets at the center of what has become a contentious relationship between the N.B.A. and the Chinese government has presented Fertitta with the most significant challenge of his two-year tenure leading one of the N.B.A.’s top franchises — well beyond the challenge of trying to bring the city a third championship.
The Rockets were the team of Yao Ming, the Hall of Fame center and one of the most popular athletes in China. Morey’s tweet, in which he shared an image that said “Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong” has — for now — mostly collapsed the partnership between the N.B.A. and China, a country in which the league has spent decades making inroads to expand its business.
The Rockets lost all team sponsorships with Chinese companies, including the apparel company Li-Ning and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank. Chinese broadcast networks have scaled back coverage of the league, and, after N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver said that he refused a demand from the Chinese government to have the Rockets fire Morey, China Central Television, the state-run network, broadcast an editorial threatening “retribution” against Silver.
Domestically, the reaction was also heated, but for a different reason.
The N.B.A. faced widespread criticism from politicians across parties for not more strongly standing behind Morey in its initial statement on Oct. 6, which described as “regrettable” the offense that many Chinese people felt because of Morey’s tweet. Other basketball figures received backlash as well. James Harden, a star on the Rockets, was criticized for saying: “We apologize. You know, we love China,” at a practice in Tokyo, where the Rockets played a preseason game. Steve Kerr, the coach of the Golden State Warriors, was mocked by President Trump for declining to comment on the China tensions.
LeBron James, one of the most popular athletes in the world, was castigated for appearing to blame Morey for the conflict with China, saying that the general manager “wasn’t educated on the situation at hand.”
Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican of Texas, said that for James “kissing up to Chinese communists and tyrants and apologizing for murderers, that’s not a good look.” Separately, Cruz told CNBC: “We’ve seen the N.B.A. falling all over itself to back track, and everyone understands why. There’s big money in China.”
Fertitta, despite having rushed to distance himself from Morey’s comments, escaped much of the glare.
Cruz did not mention Fertitta but did invite Silver to testify before a congressional subcommittee on the constitution that he chairs. Senator John Cornyn, also a Republican of Texas, slammed the N.B.A., without naming the Rockets’ owner.
The attention from Texas politicians is not surprising, given that the N.B.A. has three franchises in the state. But Fertitta has also donated about $45,700 to political action committees associated with Cornyn and $35,500 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the maximum allowed in 2019. Fertitta also donated to Cruz’s Senate re-election campaign last year. A spokeswoman for Cruz declined to comment, and a spokesman for Cornyn did not respond to an email.
Fertitta’s political activity also has included business-minded pragmatism. He recently led an unsuccessful campaign for Houston to host the 2020 Democratic National Convention, which likely would have been a financial boost for Fertitta’s Houston-based enterprises. Milwaukee was chosen instead.
These efforts have helped make him a friend of the political class rather than the target of its criticism.
Fertitta made much of his fortune in the restaurant and hospitality business. His company, Fertitta Entertainment, owns and operates the company Landry’s Inc., which oversees hundreds of restaurants including Atlantic Grill, Dos Caminos and Joe’s Crab Shack. Recently, Fertitta purchased the Del Frisco’s chain of grilles and steakhouses. Americans who do not follow basketball may know him from his CNBC show, in which he travels the United States visiting small businesses.
The restaurateur also owns several Golden Nugget casinos in the United States. Gambling is the Fertitta family business: His cousins, Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta, own the Las-Vegas based chain Station Casinos.
Associates describe Fertitta as jovial, versatile, inquisitive — and usually outspoken.
“He kind of lets you know where he stands,” said Sylvester Turner, the Democratic mayor of Houston and a longtime friend of Fertitta’s.
Peter K. Taaffe, a lawyer with the Houston-based Buzbee Law Firm, said Fertitta has “a good ability to give his input when it’s important.” Taaffe and Fertitta are on the Board of Regents for the University of Houston system; Fertitta is board chairman.
Taaffe said the sensitivities regarding China might have been too risky for Fertitta’s typical approach.
“Those types of relations are incredibly delicate for the most professional diplomats and politicians,” Taaffe said. “My only observation is that I’m not surprised that Tilman has handled it in — I think — an appropriate way.”
Turner, the Houston mayor, who has known Fertitta for at least 20 years, also defended Fertitta, saying that he has had little choice besides thinking carefully before speaking further.
“There are a lot of dynamics involved,” Turner said. “In a situation like that, I think it is prudent to be more patient and not just be quick to comment.”
But Fertitta had been willing to speak on politics, particularly domestic issues, before — and without distancing the Rockets from his views. Just weeks before Morey shared the Hong Kong image, Fertitta told Yahoo that socialism “scares the hell out of me.” In 2017, he told CNBC that President Trump was doing a “great job.” That same year, he criticized San Francisco for requiring some businesses to set aside money for employee health insurance, raising costs for his restaurants in the city.
Soon after buying the Rockets, which he did in 2017 for a then-record $2.2 billion, Fertitta weighed in on another debate about free speech and athletes stemming from football players who were kneeling at games during the national anthem — much to the ire of President Trump, Cruz and many Republicans.
“The N.B.A. has a rule, and the rule is you stand for the national anthem, O.K.?” Fertitta told Forbes. “And the N.B.A. has told us these are the rules, and so we’re going to follow the rules at the Houston Rockets.”
Asked whether he would be comfortable with his employees publicly voicing their political views in the future, Fertitta declined to comment.

 vaulted up the moneyed rankings in the Senate; as of 2018 he was the 10th wealthiest senator, according to Roll Call
American Basketball vs. Chinese Hardball: Guess Who Won,"The N.B.A. is the latest entertainment giant to incite nationalist anger in China, where political submission has become the price of admission to a market of 1.4 billion.
BEIJING — Back in the Cold War, the sclerotic Soviet system proved no match for the lure of American soft power: bluejeans, jazz, rock ’n’ roll, Coca-Cola, Hollywood. All became symbols of American freedom and prosperity that no amount of communist prohibitions could stop.
Today, China poses a far more formidable yet lucrative challenge for some of the most famous icons of American culture — Apple, Disney, Lady Gaga, and lately the National Basketball Association. Selling the best of American creativity and talent increasingly demands submission to the views of the Communist Party as the price of admission.
A recent furor that began with a single tweet by an N.B.A. executive in support of the Hong Kong protests has underscored the consequences of China’s willingness to use its vast economic clout to police any political values that threaten the party’s legitimacy or its policies.
It is the soft power of cultural vitality — as opposed to the hard, coercive power of military might — that makes the United States admirable in the eyes of much of the world, including China. The companies and organizations that produce much of this culture, however, have had to increasingly bend to China’s political will under its leader, Xi Jinping, whose ambition is to make his country a counterweight, if not an alternative, to the United States.
Amid this new world order, the expectation that American music, movies and entertainment will coax China closer toward the liberal values of its Western rival — or at least build good will, as it did in the Soviet Union — has dimmed.
In case after case in recent years, American executives have yielded to Chinese demands to tailor their words and products, as Hollywood studios now regularly do, or to apologize, even for unintentional slights. The reward is continued access to Chinese customers; the price may be the erosion of American credibility as a beacon of free speech.
“For all of Xi’s rhetoric about preserving globalization and open commerce, shoring up domestic nationalism is the focus of Xi’s international strategy,” Jessica Chen Weiss, a professor of government at Cornell University, wrote by email. “The Chinese government under Xi has become much more willing to use the power of the Chinese market to force foreign corporations and the entertainment industry to toe the Party’s line on nationalist issues.”
The Communist Party has virtually unlimited resources to marshal popular outrage for its own political ends, but China also risks damaging its own international image when those sentiments boil over, often in unpredictable ways.
For years, companies have acquiesced to China with little notice, as happened with Marriott, the Gap, Versace and United Airlines for references to Hong Kong or Taiwan that Beijing saw as implicit endorsements of those territories’ independence. Then the N.B.A. tripped global alarms over the same issue.
That furor rattled executives and infuriated American politicians and others who seem to be coming to the conclusion that American entertainment giants are too beholden to China’s 1.4 billion potential consumers and, by extension, to the Communist Party. It even became a talking point for presidential hopefuls in the United States looking to decry China’s influence.
“When it comes to national sovereignty, the Chinese government is signaling loud and clear that it would rather be feared than loved,” Professor Weiss said. “This may work to discipline foreign corporations but backfire by increasing general dislike of China.”
Chinese censorship of American entertainment has already become so pervasive that it has become a subject of mockery — at least for those brave enough to risk losing access. “South Park,” the satirical cartoon, found itself blocked from mention in China this month after a recent episode ridiculed the Chinese cultural overseers and American companies that give in to them.
When the latest scandal erupted, the cartoon creators offered an apology. “Like the N.B.A., we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts,” the show’s official account wrote on Twitter. “We too love money more than freedom and democracy.”
The Houston Rockets general manager, Daryl Morey, almost immediately deleted the tweet that started the commotion, but it was too late to stem the damage.
As Mao Zedong said, a single spark can start a prairie fire.
The N.B.A.’s plans for China, which seemed rosy barely a week ago, were suddenly gutted. Broadcasts were canceled, sponsorships suspended. The league faced denunciations from state news media and from aggrieved fans tearing up tickets for an exhibition game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets in Shanghai on T hursday.
According to Jude Blanchette, Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, “While there were undoubtedly many Chinese who were genuinely outraged by Morey’s single tweet, the idea of a monolithic block of 1.4 billion Chinese citizens is a product of C.C.P.-controlled media rather than a reflection of reality.”
“For companies looking to do business with or in China, staying ‘apolitical’ is becoming increasingly unsustainable,” he added.
The Chinese authorities appeared, belatedly, to grasp the consequences of the furor and moved to temper reports and commentary about the N.B.A. that, like previous outpourings of nationalistic fervor, were threatening to spiral out of the government’s control.
“Even with the N.B.A., if you take to hurling abuses, or using linguistic violence, like hatred and invective, that will only make the problems even more complicated, and they may become more serious,” said Tong Zeng, a businessman in Beijing who has been involved in protests and campaigns against Japan.
Shortly before Mr. Xi took office in 2012, anti-Japan protests erupted over a disputed cluster of uninhabited islands, demonstrations that spilled over into violence and arson. The sales of Toyota, Mazda and other Japanese cars slumped in China. Since then, Mr. Xi’s government has reined in nationalist street protests and mass boycotts.
“In China, preserving stability is the most important thing,” Mr. Tong said. “Taking to the streets would be impossible.”
For an emerging superpower, China can seem thin-skinned, and its reactions petulant. Lady Gaga faced a temporary ban on performances and sales in China in 2017 after she met the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader whom the Communist Party denounces as a separatist.
Last year, Gap was forced to apologize for selling a T-shirt showing a map of China that did not contain Taiwan or islands in the South China Sea. Chinese social media users excoriated the company, even though the shirt was sold in an outlet in Canada, not in China.
Jonathan McClory, the general manager for Asia for Portland Communications and the editor of an annual survey on soft power published with the University of Southern California, said such responses were “not a good look.”
“This reaction will have a negative impact on how people perceive China, not just in the United States, but around the world,” he added.
Until Mr. Morey’s tweet, basketball had appeared to be one area that had escaped the souring mood between China and the United States.
The sport has been a textbook example of soft power, a phrase coined in the late 1980s by Joseph S. Nye Jr., a professor and dean at Harvard, to describe the ability of a country’s culture and political ideals to influence others.
During the Cold War’s ideological struggle between capitalism and communism, the American government used soft power to try to win hearts and minds. When the United States Army sent Elvis Presley to West Germany, it was also sending the Soviet bloc on the other side a potent symbol of American cultural life.
It is much less a part of deliberate foreign policy now, in the era of globalization, but American popular culture still penetrates most parts of the world. Even in areas hostile to American government actions, brands like Apple, Coca-Cola and Marvel win plenty of customers.
“If people act in ways that China wants because they are attracted by its economy or performance or culture, that is soft power,” Mr. Nye wrote in an email. “If China makes access to its market dependent on our changing our behavior, that is coercive hard power.”
The N.B.A. has a large and fervent following in China, and the league has tried to return that love, looking to China as a major market, and as a recruiting ground for players like Yao Ming, the former Houston Rockets player who is revered across the country.
Even Mr. Xi is a fan of the sport. In early 2012, when he was still China’s leader-in-waiting, he visited the United States, capping his trip by attending a game of the Los Angeles Lakers and receiving his own bright yellow Lakers jersey.
“Basketball is a sport with a major global influence, and the Chinese public love it,” Mr. Xi said in August during this year’s basketball World Cup, which was held in China.
Mr. Morey’s comment appeared to ignite a buildup of frustration with the United States that has mounted amid the trade war. The protests in Hong Kong, which have raged through the summer, have compounded that, even prompting accusations that American officials were aiding and abetting violence there to weaken the party’s grip on power.
The Communist Party’s propaganda machine seized on Mr. Morey’s expression of support for the protests to give the United States a stinging lesson in the commercial cost of provoking Chinese nationalism. Although the government clearly massaged public opinion, the outrage seemed genuine.
Xu Guyong, a 46-year-old civil servant, traveled from Zhejiang Province to catch this week's game in Shanghai. He and his son, 13, both wore Lakers jerseys. Yet he still condemned Mr. Morey’s tweet.
“If people in China say we should boycott N.B.A., I’m all for it,” he said. “I would answer the country’s calling and give up watching.”
The league rushed to contain the fire, offering an apology and distancing itself from Mr. Morey’s view — only to face its own backlash for seeming to pander to Beijing. To some American lawmakers, the episode amounted to China undermining one of America’s basic rights: free speech.
“TV networks, airlines, hotel chains, retailers & Hollywood already self censor,” Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said on Twitter. “Now private citizens risk losing their jobs if they offend China.”
Mr. McClory, the editor of the annual survey on soft power, noted that in today’s world commercial interests trumped any intention to promote a set of political values.
“The N.B.A. looks at China not as a place to go out and fly the flag for the U.S., or to trumpet the values of democracy and free speech,” he said. “They want to be there, to put it bluntly, for profit motives.”
By late in the week, the Houston Rockets were still struggling to find their balance. When a journalist from CNN tried to ask two team members, James Harden and Russell Westbrook, on Thursday in Tokyo if they still felt comfortable commenting on social and political issues, a media officer for the Rockets stepped in to curtail any reply.
“Excuse me,” said the officer, “we are taking basketball questions only.”

"In Hong Kong, Life Goes On (Despite the Whiff of Tear Gas)","Most Hong Kongers have never seen anything like this summer. But that doesn’t mean the city has come to a halt.
HONG KONG — Most of Hong Kong’s newspapers carried the same photo on their front pages Monday: a police officer in riot gear, his eyes wide, pointing a revolver at protesters. The photo, also beamed around the world on satellite television, captured a single, electrifying moment in months of demonstrations, which have often been described as “paralyzing” and “roiling” this city of seven million people.
But other images tell another, less tantalizing version of events: that despite the protests, life is proceeding relatively normally.
In a video recorded by a New York Times reporter, students in a baking class barely batted an eye last weekend when black-clad protesters surrounded their classroom in a shopping mall. In a photo that spread across social media this month, a man at a street stall nonchalantly purchased fish balls, a popular snack, as smoke from a tear-gas canister swirled around him.
In short: This bastion of capitalism on China’s southern coast is still going about its business. The ATMs are dispensing cash. The stock market is filling orders, although it has lost $300 billion in market value since June and many economists predict the territory could soon fall into recession.
High-end restaurants are taking reservations. Street vendors are hawking their wares. And with few — but very notable — exceptions, the trains are running on time and the airport, the world’s seventh busiest, is operational. (Protesters, however, have vowed to disrupt the airport again on Sunday.)
Lawyers, civil servants, accountants, teachers and aviation employees have all held demonstrations in recent weeks — an indication of broad antigovernment sentiment — only to return to their jobs after a few hours, a sign that showing up to work is still a priority. Citywide transportation shutdowns and days-long general strikes have yet to materialize. The school year is set to start next week, right on schedule.
“Yes, of course people are still eating and working,” said Jeffrey Mok, 33, an employee at a roadside fish ball shop in Kowloon. “Those office workers who buy their breakfast here still come every morning, and they go to work just like that.”
“Just because Hong Kong has a huge problem now doesn’t mean we have to put our lives on hold,” he said, summing up the sentiment of many. “We are all worried, but life goes on.”
The worries are real. Most residents have seen nothing like this in their lifetime. The “one country, two systems” arrangement under which China took back the onetime British colony in 1997, promising decades of freedom and relative autonomy, has never looked so fragile.
And yet the city goes on. So confident are the protesters that its ubiquitous 7-Elevens and McDonald’s outlets will stay open, no matter the chaos, that the former is relied on as a dispensary of umbrellas (surprisingly good at repelling tear gas canisters), while vouchers to the latter are often distributed at marches to feed and hydrate weary protesters.
For many of the hundreds of thousands of residents who have joined the protests, demonstrating is a weekend activity. Come Monday, everyone goes back to work.
“Our lives are actually still very normal on weekdays,” said Karen Lau, 22, a university student. “Just last Friday, I went to do my nails with my close friend and then we had Japanese food. It sounds funny, because the very next day we were facing tear gas and risking our lives in Kwun Tong. I think this is what’s unique about our protest this time. We are all ordinary people living our ordinary little lives.”
Hong Kongers may be willing to rock the boat, but for now, they are unwilling to capsize it. Beijing also seems unwilling to push the envelope too far, advancing a policy of stalemate rather than risk a bloody crackdown.
Even the local government seems torn between describing the protests as a growing menace and a contained exercise. Soon after the State Department issued a warning to American travelers visiting Hong Kong, officials here said the city remained a welcoming place for visitors and had a long tradition of peaceful protests.
“The impact of these illegal confrontations is confined to a limited area near the procession routes, and is not widespread,” the government said in a statement.
Despite Beijing’s claim that the protesters are attempting to foment a “color revolution,” similar to those that upended governments in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, there are, as of now, no signs of the political instability or breakdown in civil society that were hallmarks of those events.
None of which is to say that the protests have been small or unsuccessful. Nor is it to say they have not taken a toll on the economy, or descended into violence.
Shops may be open for business, but those catering to foreign tourists and mainland Chinese visitors have been particularly pinched. Luxury brands, hotels and airlines have seen, or expect to see, a decline in business. Visitors are expected to put off traveling to the city because of the protests, which the authorities have characterized as “riots.” Even Trevor Noah, the host of “The Daily Show,” cited the protests when he canceled a comedy show here this month.
“Recent events in Hong Kong over the past two months did not substantially impact our passenger business in July,” Ronald Lam, a spokesman for Cathay Pacific, the territory’s flagship airline, said in a statement. “However, we anticipate a much more significant impact to our revenue in August and onwards. Traffic into Hong Kong, both business and leisure, has weakened substantially.”
Thousands of residents have taken to the streets weekly since early June, when the first large demonstrations were held against an unpopular bill that would allow extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist Party controls the courts. Since then, the protesters’ demands have expanded to include universal suffrage and an investigation into allegations of police brutality.
Most of the protesters have been peaceful, with rally organizers applying for permits and marchers mostly sticking to routes approved by the police.
The protesters grabbing headlines of late have not been the hundreds of thousands of peaceful demonstrators, but a subset of several hundred who are willing to block roads, destroy property and fight the police.
In a single day this month, the police used more than 800 cans of tear gas against protesters. In July, demonstrators stormed the local legislature, breaking windows and marring the walls with graffiti. Protesters have accused the police of using excessive force and letting thugs assault demonstrators with impunity. The police say they have shown immense restraint against the protesters, some of whom have attacked them with makeshift weapons.
The officer in Monday’s front-page photo, for instance, was pointing his gun at protesters with sticks who were charging at him and his fellow officers. He didn’t shoot anyone. But someone fired a warning shot.

The Spirit That Brought Down the Berlin Wall Lives On,"Bloodless revolutions from Armenia to Lebanon are about ending the fatalism corrupt rule engenders.
YEREVAN, Armenia — It has been 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall. A guard threw open a gate, the Soviet imperium folded, more than 100 million people in Central and Eastern Europe were freed, a divided continent was made whole, and the end of history was announced.
What to make of the three decades after Nov. 9, 1989? Poverty receded. Lives got longer. Human exchange became borderless. Artificial intelligence started making things smart. China rose, as did sea levels. The United States, attacked and wounded, tried managed decline, and at last, in wild frustration, elected a loudmouthed con man to its highest office. History, not terminated after all, ushered in a new wave of nationalism, nativism and xenophobia.
Water is the new oil. Data is the new plutonium. Climate is the new Armageddon. The talk in 1990 of the inevitability of a world of liberal democracy turned to predictions of a world of autocrats buttressed by the surveillance states that technology has enabled. It has proved impossible for technology companies to do no evil.
The best of all possible worlds was deferred yet again. Joachim Gauck, the Lutheran pastor and anti-Communist East German activist who later became president of a united Germany, captured the illusions and shattered hopes of 1989 best: “We dreamed of paradise and woke up in North Rhine-Westphalia.”
Of course, North Rhine-Westphalia is not bad, but in our polarized all-or-nothing political age not bad is generally not good enough. In the forgotten-words stakes, compromise rivals statesmanship.
Big things changed, and small. My lackluster soccer club, Chelsea, got a Russian oligarch as owner and, with his billions, started winning trophies. I’d never thought the fall of Communism could so directly affect my mood. The Russians arrived — on the Côte d’Azur, on the beaches of Vietnam and, of course, in Syria. And here in Armenia, the great Armenian saga of tragedy, migration, reinvention and survival took another twist.
The Soviet Union fell apart. The Republic of Armenia became an independent state in 1991. It got a tiny piece of the worst possible real estate Armenia had occupied over the millenniums of its history, but still it was something.
In every office there are images of Mount Ararat, which rises in Turkey, a symbol for Armenians of longing, pride, the hope of return and the suffering of the Armenian genocide that began in 1915 and involved the Ottoman Empire’s killing of more than one million Armenians.
The House of Representatives, defying familiar Turkish warnings, this week passed a resolution recognizing that genocide. President Barack Obama never recognized it publicly, despite a promise to do so as a presidential candidate in 2008. Realpolitik won out over his principles.
Turkey, which insists there was no organized campaign to slaughter Armenians, is not Armenia’s only problem. Comrade Stalin loved to tinker with nationalities and borders. Decades later, this caused friction between Armenia and Azerbaijan as the Soviet Union collapsed. The disputes culminated in war over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region a quarter-century ago. Today, Armenia’s border with Azerbaijan is closed. Its border with Turkey is closed. Only the borders with Georgia and Iran are open.
Yet I found Armenians in upbeat mood! What do physical borders matter these days? The nearly three million citizens of Armenia are in constant touch with the many more millions of Armenians in the diaspora, who are sending money home. With a strong tech sector, Armenia sees itself as a start-up country. It’s looking forward more than back.
The country’s bloodless revolution in 2018 has not delivered paradise, but it has eliminated fatalism. People feel they have the freedom to try what they want.
Weeks of mass protests against corruption and cronyism brought down the old Armenian political class, much as massive demonstrations in Beirut, Baghdad and Santiago in recent weeks have brought down or shaken the governments of Lebanon, Iraq and Chile.
The spirit of 1989 has not been trampled underfoot by Russia’s Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping, after all. People prefer agency to the dead hand of unaccountable rule. They prefer the rule of law to arbitrary arrest. That’s why they are in the streets of Hong Kong.
Liberal democracy is not, as Putin has insisted, “obsolete.” It just needed a jolt.
Armen Sarkissian, the Armenian president, told me in an interview that old systems would not work. “We are living in a quantum world because more than half of life is virtual,” he said. The notion of democracies functioning through elections every few years is outdated. He called Armenia “one of the first labs” to find new “rules or behavior” for a world where every individual has a voice that “is exercised and expressed daily.”
On the Armenian genocide, and Turkey’s denial, Sarkissian said this: “Recognition of something that you have done wrong in ordinary life, in your family, with your friends, recognition is a strength. It’s not a weakness. If you take Turkey recognizing the Armenian genocide, that will also be recognition of the fact Turkey is on its way to become a tolerant state.”
One enduring lesson of 1989 is that the truth will out. Even the Trump White House will one day discover this.

"Li Peng, Chinese Leader Derided for Role in Tiananmen Crackdown, Dies at 90","Li Peng, the former Chinese premier derided as the stone-faced “butcher of Beijing” for his role in the bloody crackdown on the Tiananmen Square democracy movement in 1989, died on Monday in the Chinese capital. He was 90.
Mr. Li’s death was announced by Xinhua, the state-run news agency, which gave no specific cause.
Born to Communist revolutionaries in the early years of the Chinese civil war and educated as a hydroelectric engineer in the Soviet Union, Mr. Li rose to the top ranks of the Communist Party, serving as a bridge between the old guard and the more technocratic leaders who succeeded them.
He served 10 years as prime minister and then five years, until his retirement in 2003, as chief of the National People’s Congress, the country’s party-dominated, rubber-stamp Parliament.
Mr. Li, a wooden presence on television, was never widely loved by the Chinese public, but he wielded great power late in his career as a top-ranking member of the secretive Politburo Standing Committee, the country’s leading center of power. That he survived at such a rarefied level suggested that he was more politically adroit than his stodgy public image indicated.
Mr. Li is most widely remembered as the forbidding official in a Mao suit who appeared on television in May 1989 to announce the imposition of martial law in urban Beijing and to denounce leaders of the giant pro-democracy protests that had occupied Tiananmen Square in the heart of the city. They were enemies of the Communist Party, he declared, who imperiled “the fate and future of the People’s Republic of China, built by many revolutionary martyrs with their blood.”
Historians have debated how much personal responsibility Mr. Li bore for the army’s assault on students and workers beginning late on June 3, 1989, when tanks and troops with automatic rifles opened fire, killing hundreds if not more as they plowed toward Tiananmen Square. The troops took the square early on June 4.
Scholars have also debated Mr. Li’s role in the removal and permanent house arrest that spring of his more liberal rival, Zhao Ziyang, the Communist Party general secretary, who was nominally of a higher rank. Mr. Zhao had advocated negotiating with the students and opposed using the army against them. Mr. Zhao died in 2005.
Since 1989, critics had called for Mr. Li to face trial or a public reckoning for his role in the bloodshed. But 30 years after the Tiananmen crackdown, the Communist Party shows no sign of disavowing the decision to use armed force.
A ‘Most Active’ Suppressor
Mr. Li would later protest — accurately, in the view of most experts — that the momentous decision to send in troops in 1989 could have been made only by Deng Xiaoping, the elderly behind-the-scenes leader and military chairman who had set China on its post-Mao path of increasing economic freedom while keeping a tight grip on political power.
“True, he got the support of Deng Xiaoping for the armed suppression, but Li Peng was one of the most active of the suppressors,” said Sidney Rittenberg, who was the first American to join the Chinese Communist Party and who met Mr. Li.
Mr. Li presented his own version of events leading up the crackdown in a diarylike account that was circulated among the party’s elite and acquired by a Hong Kong publisher in 2010. In it, Mr. Li defended his conduct, describing himself as a responsible and sober-minded servant of the party and presenting Deng as the dominating force who had made a knowing decision to use armed force against the protesters.
Mr. Li recalled how he and other officials had monitored troops as they advanced toward Tiananmen Square on the night of June 3 and the early hours of June 4.
“At about half past 5 in the morning, the remaining 2,000 students and core elements behind the turmoil left through the southeast corner of the square,” he wrote. “Nobody died during the evacuation of Tiananmen Square. Thus, the cancer of the illegal occupation of Tiananmen Square was fully removed. I notified the Xinhua News Agency to report this to the country and the whole world.”
Mr. Li was known among the top leaders of the 1980s and ’90s as a conservative on economic issues, urging caution in the dismantling of state industries and the introduction of free markets.
Like many Chinese Communist leaders of his era, he revealed little of himself, usually reading from turgid official scripts in public. If there is a single colorful quotation to his name, it has not been found.
When Mr. Li was selected to a second term as prime minister in 1993, Xinhua sought to lighten his image, to wide derision. “People familiar with him say Li is kind, amiable, easy of approach and good at making friends,” the news agency reported.
His wife, Zhu Lin, was quoted as saying, “Li Peng never behaves like a domineering husband, and he always helps me do housework when he is free.” The article did not mention the luxury quarters and household servants they enjoyed in Beijing’s inner sanctum.
She and Mr. Li had two sons and a daughter. Zhu Lin became a successful businesswoman, and two of the children have run state power monopolies. Another son joined the military and later — if reports in overseas Chinese media outlets are to be believed — lived abroad.
Since Mr. Li’s retirement, members of his family, like relatives of several other elite leaders, have been dogged by accusations of corruption, described as having used their connections to amass wealth. But none have been charged with crimes.
Leftist ideology mattered less to Mr. Li than ensuring stability at almost any price and safeguarding Communist Party rule. Building his early career in the state-run power industry, he was one of the first of the so-called technocrats to rise in politics — a generation of college-educated officials, many trained in engineering, who began to take office in the 1980s and ’90s. He was known to be concerned in particular with hydroelectric power and dams.
The Costs of a Dam
One of Mr. Li’s signal legacies may be the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, which he promoted as premier. The project caused wide concern in China and abroad about potential environmental consequences — like earthquakes and landslides — and the human cost of relocating the more than 1.3 million people displaced by the rising waters behind the dam that inundated dozens of towns and cities.
“Without Li Peng’s advocacy, the Three Gorges Dam might never have been built,” said Li Cheng, an expert on Chinese leadership at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
Li Peng was born on Oct. 20, 1928, in Shanghai. His father, Li Shuoxun, was executed by Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalists in 1931 after he was captured on the southern island of Hainan, where he had been helping to organize Communist forces. Li Shuoxun became an early martyr of the revolution.
The rising Communist leader Zhou Enlai and his wife, Deng Yingchao, met young Li Peng and took him under their wing, as they did dozens of others. The boy was sent to study in the Communist redoubt of Yan’an, in central China.
In 1948, the party sent him to study at the Moscow Power Institute, where he became a leader of Chinese students in the Soviet Union. He remained in that country through the Communist victory in 1949 and Zhou’s appointment as prime minister of the new People’s Republic.
Mr. Li did not return to China until 1955, when he started his career managing hydroelectric plants. In 1966, as the tumultuous Cultural Revolution began, he was transferred to Beijing, where he served as a manager and party secretary of the Municipal Power Supply Bureau.
Despite his higher education and close ties to the Soviet Union, which by then was China’s archenemy, Mr. Li seems to have survived the decade of Mao’s Cultural Revolution without being persecuted or sent to the countryside to be re-educated, as many intellectuals were.
Many attribute his good fortune in those years to the patronage of Zhou, whose wife had helped look after the young Mr. Li when he was growing up in Yan’an. In his official memoir, Mr. Li refers to her as “Mama Deng.”
His rise after Mao’s death in 1976 was rapid. Mr. Li became national minister of power industries in 1981, was appointed to the Central Committee of the Communist Party in 1982 and joined the Politburo, a council of high officials, in 1985. His increasingly trusted status was affirmed that year when, with enmities between the Chinese and the Soviets easing, he represented China at the funeral of the Soviet leader Konstantin U. Chernenko. Mr. Li was the first senior Chinese official to meet the new Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
In 1987, Zhao Ziyang was appointed general secretary of the Communist Party, the country’s most powerful official position. Mr. Li was appointed acting prime minister and named to the five-man standing committee of the Politburo, setting the stage for the clash of wills and beliefs that would result in Mr. Zhao’s downfall amid the upheaval in the spring of 1989.
Denied the Top Job
With his unwavering prosecution of the crackdown that had been sought by Deng and other elders, Mr. Li might well have assumed that he would be given the top job of party general secretary. But Deng, who had pulled strings in secret, apparently concluded that Mr. Li was too unpopular at home and abroad to help the country recover from Tiananmen Square. He may also have suspected that Mr. Li would be too slow to unleash the economy.
Instead, Deng arranged for Jiang Zemin, the Shanghai party chief, who had managed to disperse student demonstrators with little violence, to take the job as general secretary. But even if slighted, Mr. Li remained prime minister and the second-most-powerful official in the Communist Party, a conservative balancing figure within a leadership eager to project unity.
“Li Peng was the fall guy for Tiananmen, and that’s why he didn’t get the general secretary job,” Rod MacFarquhar, an expert on Chinese politics at Harvard, had said of Mr. Li. (Mr. MacFarquhar died in February.)
Bao Tong, who was a senior aide to Mr. Zhao, the party’s general secretary in 1989, said that Mr. Li would be remembered for two controversial deeds: helping to extinguish the pro-democracy protests, and vigorously supporting construction of the Three Gorges Dam. But Mr. Bao, who was ousted in 1989, said Mr. Li’s role in the Tiananmen crackdown was as a loyal adjunct to Deng.
“He was a soldier for Deng Xiaoping, a pawn in a chess game,” Mr. Bao said by telephone on Tuesday from his home in Beijing. “Some people believe that June 4 was the outcome of him misleading Deng Xiaoping, and he led Deng Xiaoping into making mistakes. But I think that’s overestimating Li Peng. He was following Deng Xiaoping.”
To this day, publicly challenging the official account of what became known as the June 4 Massacre of 1989 is a political taboo in China and can lead to detention. But many liberal-minded Chinese hope for an eventual honest reckoning and an official reversal of the verdict — so vigorously promoted by Mr. Li — that the student demonstrators were actually tools of China’s enemies.
If that happens, Mr. Li is not likely to fare well in Chinese history books.
But the official tribute to Mr. Li — at a time when fervent protests against Beijing’s rule are underway in Hong Kong, the semiautonomous Chinese territory — indicated that China’s official position on 1989 remained unchanged.
“Comrade Li Peng took a firm position and together with the majority of comrades in the Politburo adopted resolute measures to halt the turmoil and quell the counterrevolutionary rebellion,” Xinhua said.
It said his actions had “played an important role in a great struggle concerning the fate of the party and the country.”

Cheers in Beijing Can’t Drown Out the Protesters in Hong Kong,"As President Xi celebrates 70 years of Communist rule, a democratic enclave resists.
It was hard to imagine a greater contrast. While China’s rulers were celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic with an enormous parade of missiles and technological achievements meant to intimidate and impress, Hong Kong witnessed some of the most violent protests in four months of demonstrations against Beijing’s encroachment on the enclave’s autonomy.
There was no subtlety in either President Xi Jinping’s celebration of his country’s raw power, or Hong Kong’s rejection of the repressive rule behind that power. Something will have to give.
Mr. Xi was central to his show. Clad in a Mao suit, he made no mention of his immediate predecessors as he presided over an awesome display of what he calls the “Chinese dream,” a broad vision of China’s rise as an economic, military and police force to be reckoned with. “No force can shake the status of our great motherland, no force can obstruct the advance of the Chinese people and Chinese nation,” he declared.
These were not idle words. Mr. Xi has not hesitated to use force in bringing minorities like the Tibetans or the Uighurs to heel, and the showpiece of the parade was the giant DF-41, an intercontinental ballistic missile that can carry 10 nuclear warheads and strike anywhere in the United States.
Hong Kong protesters were manifestly not impressed. On the contrary, they welcomed the opportunity to demonstrate their opposition to indirect Communist rule over their theoretically autonomous district by upstaging Beijing’s show. The day’s demonstrations began peacefully but turned violent in various outlying districts after nightfall as protesters, many dressed in black, set fires and clashed with the police. For the first time since the protests began in June, a demonstrator was wounded with a live bullet by a cornered officer.
There is nothing to suggest that Mr. Xi appreciates what is really taking place in Hong Kong. The system that the Chinese Communist Party has shaped over seven decades of repressive rule, like the 70 years in which Soviet Communists controlled their empire, brooks no diversity of thought or challenge to authority. Raised in the brutal paternalism of that system, Mr. Xi equates greatness with power and dissent with treachery; to him, the 50 years of relative autonomy granted Hong Kong, which ends in 2047, is time to wipe out whatever bad foreign habits its people picked up.
Those habits, acquired under British colonial rule, include a Western political culture of democracy, human rights, free speech and independent thought. And what began in June as mass protests against legislation that would have made it possible to extradite Hong Kong people to mainland China has morphed over succeeding weeks into increasingly violent and explicit protests against Chinese control, which is exercised in Hong Kong by an executive handpicked by Beijing and its local allies.
That some protesters have resorted to violence, including firebombs and bats, can only be condemned, as must be the excessive force of the police. The demonstrations had, and have, far greater power when they are peaceful.
That is one message liberal democracies should send the people of Hong Kong. The far more important message should be that the free world, to resurrect a Cold War term, stands with them in their rejection of what the Chinese Communist Party stands for. And the urgent message to Beijing, as tensions rise to the breaking point, must be that any attempt to crush the protests by forces from the mainland will meet with a strong response.
Unfortunately, President Trump saw fit to send Beijing congratulations on the 70th anniversary, without any mention of Hong Kong. Mr. Trump is locked into his own strange love-hate relationship with Mr. Xi, which includes personal praise and escalating tariffs, and he probably regards Hong Kong and its aspirations as a regrettable diversion. But that should not preclude Congress, or America’s allies, from speaking out.

"Fearing China’s Rule, Hong Kong Residents Resist Extradition Plan","HONG KONG — Politicians have staged sit-ins and exchanged blows in the legislature. Nurses, high school teachers and even anime fans have organized petitions. And the authorities are bracing for protests on Sunday that could be the largest since the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement shut down parts of Hong Kong five years ago.
Anger is boiling in Hong Kong over a push for a law that would allow people to be extradited to mainland China. Critics say the legislation would subject residents of this semiautonomous territory to the security forces and courts controlled by the ruling Communist Party on the mainland.
“This law would allow China to take whoever they want here, or at least use it to intimidate,” said Wong Choi-fung, who started an online petition for stay-at-home mothers that has collected more than 6,000 signatures. “It is absolutely crazy.”
“As mothers,” she added, “you never know what profession your children will choose, or if they would one day do something to irritate the unpredictable Chinese government.”
The fight against the proposal has become the most serious showdown between the public and the authorities since the Umbrella protests in 2014 demanding free elections, revealing growing fears about an erosion of the civil liberties that set this former British colony apart from the rest of China.
Opposition to the bill drew a large protest of tens of thousands of people in April. Scuffles broke out last month as opposition lawmakers sought to extend debate over the measure. But with pro-Beijing lawmakers holding 43 of the 70 seats in the legislature, the law is likely to be passed this month.
The fierce public outcry puts Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, who was selected by China’s leaders to govern the territory two years ago, in a delicate position. Moving ahead with the vote on the proposal could incite bigger protests and even unrest, but backing down risks emboldening the opposition and drawing the ire of her party benefactors, who back the bill.
In recent weeks, Ms. Lam and her allies have sought to assure the public that the new extradition powers would not be abused, but anxiety and frustration have only grown.
“It’s like a thousand cuts have been depressing people,” said Antony Dapiran, a Hong Kong-based lawyer and the author of a book about dissent in Hong Kong. “People don’t trust Beijing, that’s what it comes down to.”
The government’s proposal would allow it to detain and transfer people wanted in countries and territories that have no formal extradition agreements with Hong Kong. Ms. Lam has said it was urgently needed to bring to justice a Hong Kong man who is wanted in Taiwan for the murder of his girlfriend last year.
But opponents object because the bill would also allow for extraditions to mainland China, where protections for defendants are weak and the party routinely prosecutes dissidents and others for political reasons.
Several senior Chinese Communist Party leaders, including Han Zheng, a vice premier, have expressed support for the bill, saying it would improve the city’s legal system and prevent it from becoming a haven for fugitives. China is concerned that the city is a refuge or transit point for corrupt officials or businesspeople fleeing the mainland.
The government’s case, however, is undercut by a series of high-profile abductions of people in Hong Kong in recent years, presumably by mainland security agents.
Among the most brazen was that of Xiao Jianhua, a Chinese billionaire, who in 2017 was taken from the Four Seasons Hotel, seated in a wheelchair with his head covered, to the mainland. He has not been heard from since.
Five men who worked for a Hong Kong publisher of scandal-packed exposés about Chinese leaders disappeared into Chinese custody in late 2015. One of the men, Lam Wing-kee, said after his release that he had been forced to give a televised confession. He fled to Taiwan in April out of fear that he would be sent back to the mainland after the extradition bill passes.
Billy Li, a representative of the Progressive Lawyers Group in Hong Kong, said the extradition proposal could be more dangerous than Article 23, a Beijing-backed package of laws against treason, subversion and sedition that was shelved after hundreds of thousands marched against it in 2003.
Article 23 “was talking about people being tried and sentenced to imprisonment in Hong Kong,” he said. “Now we are talking about sending people to China, where the track record in terms of human rights is just too notorious.”
The city’s two main lawyers’ associations, the Law Society and the Hong Kong Bar Association, have urged the government to delay the extradition bill’s passage in order to hold public consultations.
Local and foreign business associations and other groups also have raised objections to the bill.
The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and a United States congressional commission said it could hurt the city’s reputation as a safe place for international business. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the bill threatened the rule of law in Hong Kong, and his counterparts in Britain and Canada said they worried about the risks to their citizens living there.
A high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong was guaranteed under the pact between China and Britain that returned the city to Chinese control in 1997. But in recent years, many in Hong Kong have become worried about the encroachment of the authoritarian Chinese state.
The courts removed six pro-democracy lawmakers from office in 2016 and 2017, after they altered their oaths of office to protest the Chinese government.
The bill requires an extradition request to first be approved by the chief executive before an arrest warrant is issued. The request then goes to a court that is empowered to check that there is a basic case against a person, but not to review evidence in detail. There is only one opportunity for the person to appeal an extradition decision.
Trying to address some objections from business groups, the government has dropped nine economic crimes — including securities and tax violations but not bribery or money laundering — from a list of extraditable offenses. The bill’s language was also adjusted so it covers only offenses that carry sentences of seven or more years in prison, up from three years.
Local business groups have cautiously welcomed the concessions, but some members have still expressed reservations. Other groups have used them against the government, arguing that Ms. Lam has essentially acknowledged that the mainland authorities cannot be trusted to fairly prosecute certain crimes.
“You never know when you might irritate someone powerful,” said Danny Lau, a Hong Kong businessman who set up a factory in the mainland city of Dongguan 30 years ago.
“They can either dig out something from a long time ago, or they can forge evidence and witnesses — which isn’t hard to do in mainland China — to set you up, threaten you and bend you to their will.”
An unusually wide cross-section of society has mobilized against the bill, with hundreds of petitions posted online that have gathered tens of thousands of signatures.
Church leaders fear the law could target members of their congregations who volunteer in the mainland. Construction workers say they are worried about mainland crackdowns on organized labor. Anime fans have cited the imprisonment of publishers of banned books and detention of cosplayers in China.
The broad scope of fears underscores how wide-ranging China’s crackdown on civil society has been as President Xi Jinping has sought to tighten the party’s control over the country.
Edgar Pang, a horse racing columnist, started a petition for the racing community out of fear that the industry, which is legal in Hong Kong, could be targeted by the authorities in the mainland, where gambling is illegal.
“Countless people bet on horse races here,” he said. “So one day when the central government decides that it doesn’t approve of this behavior, they can be implicated.”
Tin Fong-chak, a middle school teacher of liberal studies, said the extradition law could create a chilling effect on teachers, who might avoid discussing in the classroom topics that are censored in the mainland.
“As educators, we worry about our students,” Mr. Tin said. “What kind of future and what kind of society are we leaving behind for them?”

The Chinese Threat to American Speech,"American companies have an obligation to defend the freedom of expression, even at the risk of angering China.
China’s assertive campaign to police discourse about its policies, even outside of its borders, and the acquiescence of American companies eager to make money in China, pose a dangerous and growing threat to one of this nation’s core values: the freedom of expression.
The Communist state is becoming more and more aggressive in pressuring foreign companies to choose between self-censorship and the loss of access to what will soon be the world’s largest market. An old list of taboo topics, sometimes described as the “three Ts” — Tibet, Tiananmen and Taiwan — has been joined by newer subjects that must not be mentioned, including protests in Hong Kong and China’s mistreatment of its Muslim minority.
This month, China responded to a tweet by Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, in support of the Hong Kong protesters — a message he posted while in Japan, on a website that is not even accessible in mainland China — by demanding Mr. Morey’s firing and by canceling broadcasts of N.B.A. games, a histrionic display intended not just to punish the N.B.A. but also to intimidate other foreign firms into censoring themselves. (A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman denied that the government had called for Mr. Morey’s dismissal.)
The Constitutions of China and the United States both enshrine freedom of speech, but China’s totalitarian regime has long taken a narrow view of that freedom — and American companies have long accepted those restrictions while doing business in China. Now, however, China is seeking to control not just what is said in China but what is said about China, too. If China has its way, any topic it deems off limits will be scrubbed from global discourse.
For the first time since the end of the Cold War, the United States finds itself in a contest of ideas and principles with a country in its own weight class. But this time is different. The United States and China are economically intertwined: The trade volume between the two countries is the greatest of any between two countries in the history of the world.
There is no reasonable prospect of disengagement, nor is that a desirable outcome. The clear necessity is for the two countries to find ways of living together, and coexistence requires respect for differences. Instead, China is engaged in the kind of cultural imperialism it often decries.
China insists that its national interest is at stake. So is the national interest of the United States and other free nations. China has taken a hard line, and it’s time for the United States to respond in kind. The United States and American businesses have a duty to not appease the censors in Beijing — even if the price of insisting on free expression is a loss of access to the Chinese market.
The N.B.A., to its credit, is standing firm. After an initial round of obsequious apologies prompted widespread criticism in the United States, the league’s commissioner, Adam Silver, said that the league was committed to free expression and that players and other league personnel remained free to speak their minds despite what he described as “fairly dramatic” financial repercussions from lost business in China.
“We wanted to make an absolutely clear statement that the values of the N.B.A., these American values — we are an American business — travel with us wherever we go,” Mr. Silver said on Thursday in New York. “And one of those values is free expression.”
But far too many American companies have shown that their values are for sale. They don’t even haggle much over the price. Last year, the Chinese government demanded that foreign airlines remove references to Taiwan from their websites, because China views Taiwan as a renegade province. The four American airlines affected by the order — American, Delta, Hawaiian and United — present themselves to the world as representatives of the United States. The American flag is painted on the outside of their planes; the interiors are American territory. But instead of standing up for American values, the airlines complied with China’s orders. Other recent examples of capitulation include the fashion retailer Coach destroying T-shirts that read “Hong Kong,” rather than “Hong Kong, China,” and Marriott firing a social media manager in Omaha for “liking” a tweet posted by a group that backs Tibetan independence.
Increasingly, China doesn’t even need to raise an eyebrow for global businesses to blink: American companies are engaged in proactive appeasement. In the new animated movie “Abominable,” released by DreamWorks, a subsidiary of Comcast, one scene includes a map of China with a boundary line encompassing most of the South China Sea. The United States does not recognize that line; neither do the other nations that border the sea, including Vietnam, which pulled the film from theaters. ESPN, a Disney subsidiary, displayed a similar map of China — showing what is known as the “nine-dash line” in the South China Sea — on a recent broadcast.
Comcast and Disney are, of course, free to advocate for the Chinese Communist Party’s position, and against the American and global consensus, in the continuing dispute over China’s international boundaries. But by all appearances, the decisions were both less principled and more pernicious: The companies acquiesced in China’s view of the world simply because that was the path of least resistance.
Some companies have tried to evade the issue by insisting they want to avoid politics altogether. Blizzard Entertainment, a subsidiary of the California video game maker Activision Blizzard, banned a user for shouting “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times” during an online tournament earlier this month, and confiscated $10,000 in winnings. The company, which later returned the money and commuted the ban to a six-month suspension, said it would have taken the same action if a player had shouted in opposition to the Hong Kong protesters. A rival company, the Los Angeles-based Riot Games, announced its own ban on political speech, warning players to “refrain from discussing” political issues, including the Hong Kong protests. (Tencent, a Chinese conglomerate, holds a 5 percent stake in Activision and owns the entirety of Riot.)
Companies face particular pressure on the internet because deference to physical geography is no longer a viable standard. “When in Rome, do as the Romans do,” has lost its meaning. On the internet, one is always at home and always in Rome, too. But there is, or should be, a critical point of difference between American and Chinese internet businesses. Corporations are the creatures of a particular state, however much their executives prefer to think of their operations as multinational. American companies choose to operate under the laws of the United States and to reap the benefits of life in the United States — and they ought to be held accountable for upholding the values of the United States. American companies should feel a responsibility for maintaining the right to free expression in the internet spaces they create and operate. Otherwise, they risk becoming the enforcers of a corporate regime of global censorship that takes its marching orders from Xi Jinping.
Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, which is banned in China, said this week that the character of the internet must not be taken for granted. “Today, the state of the global internet around the world is primarily defined by American companies and platforms with strong free expression values. There’s just no guarantee that will win out over time.”
Facebook’s role as the private manager of the nation’s public square generates constant controversy, most recently over its refusal to prevent politicians from disseminating clear falsehoods. And the debate over its policies highlights the challenges and contradictions of America’s commitment to free expression. Yet Mr. Zuckerberg is undoubtedly correct that his imperfect company, along with other American tech giants, are the guardians of free expression on the internet. The responsibility of American companies is to maintain that commitment to free expression even if the price is not doing business in China.
It is a price The New York Times, and several other media companies, already pay.
President Trump has weakened the ability of American companies to stand up for American values, including free expression, by making clear he does not share those values and by failing to firmly oppose China’s demands. A White House spokeswoman last year described China’s order to airlines as “Orwellian nonsense,” but the administration, which has been so quick to threaten China with harsh consequences for its trade policies, did not defend the airlines by warning of similar consequences for China’s efforts to suppress free speech. If American companies are to stand up for American values, their own government should be in their corner.
Back in 2009, North Carolina State University canceled an appearance by the Dalai Lama, whom China regards as an enemy of the state. The explanation offered by the school’s provost, Warwick Arden, was memorably frank: “China is a major trading partner for North Carolina.” What Mr. Arden and the many Americans in positions of authority who have since followed him down that disgraceful path seem to forget is that North Carolina is also a major trading partner for China. Those fearing the loss of what the United States gets from China would do well to consider that China fears the loss of what it gets from the United States. And the government can buttress American companies by making clear that penalties for free speech will be met in kind. The proper response to a Chinese threat to prevent American planes from landing in China is to make clear that Chinese planes would not be allowed to land in the United States.
America also can strengthen its hand by making common cause with other nations that value free expression. China has placed similar pressure on the Italian company Versace; German companies, including Mercedes-Benz; and airlines from around the world.
America’s commitment to human rights, including the freedom of expression, has always required careful tending and firm resolve. It now faces an especially stern test. The world is watching — and talking.

"Hong Kong Strikes, and Strikes a Nerve in Beijing","The Chinese government is acting as though it would come unmoored if it made any concession to the protesters.
HONG KONG — Anyone who thought that the antigovernment demonstrations rocking Hong Kong this summer were just the doing of radicalized youngsters should think again. On Monday, the first general strike in the city in about 50 years brought the territory to a near-halt. The protesters making front page news are supported by Hong Kongers from all walks of life, whether or not they, too, take to the streets.
Hong Kong’s labor laws allow strikes only against one’s employer, not for general political causes. Yet the Confederation of Hong Kong Trade Unions announced that more than 350,000 people participated, calling in sick or taking the day off. Mass transportation, normally efficient and reliable, became an unnavigable morass of cancellations and delays — a rarity even during the worst typhoons. Buses and underground trains came to a complete stop at various times during the day.
People jammed traffic by driving in circles at roundabouts, extra slowly; others propped train doors open with umbrellas. Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong’s main airline, canceled most of its short-haul flights, in particular in and out of mainland China.
Some of those who took part in the strike rarely express political beliefs openly: workers at Disneyland and air traffic controllers, bankers and educators, even civil servants, who by law are required to remain neutral politically. The Hong Kong Jockey Club, which has a government-granted monopoly on gambling, stopped taking bets early and allowed employees to skip work. Some of the city’s glitziest malls kept their front doors open even though most of their luxury shops were shut, to allow protesters to seek respite from tear gas or charge their phones.
Demonstrations including professionals of all ages took place simultaneously across the territory, in working-class residential neighborhoods as well as shopping areas. As the day wore on, skirmishes erupted in at least eight districts. By nighttime, there were flare-ups in so many places, it was hard to keep up.
There were some street brawls between protesters and members of criminal gangs; police stations were besieged. According to the police, some 800 rounds of tear gas were shot on Monday alone, compared with about 1,000 for all of June and July.
The continued dillydallying of the city’s leaders, who have made very few public appearances — and have sent in the riot police against protesters but hardly have reacted to commuters being assaulted by thugs — has backfired spectacularly. More and more people are inspired to join or support the protesters in various ways, if simply by buying them meals or leaving prepaid tickets at subway stations.
This is not to say that all Hong Kongers are of one mind. Demonstrations in support of the police have taken place regularly, too, if less frequently and with fewer participants. In those rallies, which are never visited by riot police officers, participants stress their support for China, waving Chinese flags and wielding banners that declare their roots in various Chinese cities and provinces. The fault line running through Hong Kong is, more and more, about how much the city should be allowed to maintain its distinct identity or be refashioned as China’s Hong Kong.
On Tuesday, Yang Guang, the spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing, held his office’s second news conference since the beginning of the crisis more than two months ago. Previously, the office had only one in more than two decades, after Britain handed control of Hong Kong to China in 1997.
Mr. Yang didn’t address any of the protesters’ grievances or demands, such as the withdrawal of the proposed extradition bill that set off the unrest or an independent inquiry into police brutality. The mainland authorities repeated their support for the city’s chief executive and the police. They strongly condemned the violence — by protesters, that is — calling them “reckless violent groups” who will “pay the price if they play with fire.” They admonished, patronizingly, that all this striking and demonstrating was damaging Hong Kong’s economy.
“Do not mistake our restraint as being soft,” Mr. Yang also said. “Do not underestimate the central government’s determination in maintaining stability.” It was a veiled threat, and an admission of weakness, too. One of the most powerful governments in the world is acting as though it would come unmoored if it made any concession to popular demands. China seems as fragile as only a truly authoritarian government can be.
